You don't know exactly what the Jewel will look like, but you know it'll be really cool.  You know it's composed of various geometric solids (pyramids, spheres, cubes, etc.) and many colors.<br/><br/>The game rule is that, in your quest for the Jewel, you must stay on the Glittering Path.  This is a big part of the fun of the game, because when you stroll along the Path at a decent clip, its many colors and facets glitter in a truly breathtaking way.<br/><br/>The Path is composed of tiny Gems of all colors and shapes.  No two Gems are exactly alike.  The right Gems can be combined to form certain geometric solids, and the right combination of solids and Gems will ultimately produce the Jewel.  You can take any Gems you want.<br/><br/>As you prepare to step onto the path, the game tells you what you can expect to find.  Certain sections of the Path will be focused largely on <i>specific</i> geometric solids.  When you reach the "Cube" part of the Path, for example, you will see a big chunk of a cube in warm colors ahead of you, and many gems of red and orange in the Path nearby.  Eventually, your progress on the Path will take you past the cube, at which point you will either have completed its assembly, and have a big piece of the Jewel, or you will have failed, and will need a substitute geometric solid for your Jewel.<br/><br/>Time to play!<br/><br/>You step onto the Glittering Path and look over the millions of Gems before you.  You pick one up.  One face is dull blue, and rather squarish.  Another face is sharp and red.  This might be part of a cool cube, or a warm triangle, or a key joint in the Jewel!  You pick up another Gem, and it's just as promising.  In fact, <i>every</i> Gem looks just as promising.  But now you're standing still, and the Path isn't glittering.  You select a bunch of Gems and press forward.  As you get up to speed, the Path glitters again, and is awesome and blissful, but you keep passing Gems that look like they might be important!  Also, the Gems you are carrying threaten to slip from your arms, and you need to divert your attention from the blissful Path in order to hold onto them.<br/><br/>As you approach the warm-colored chunk of cube, you slow, and search the Gems in front of you for reds, oranges, and yellows, and right angles.  A few Gems are obvious and perfect fits, but many more are <i>partly</i> red, and/or <i>fairly</i> angular.  And mixed in are plenty of Gems of uniquely cool attributes that might make valued pieces of the Jewel!  Now you're stopped again, and your arms are filling up with slippery Gems, and the Path no longer glitters.<br/><br/>What to do?  At some point, you probably do a cost/benefit analysis.  You weigh the importance of strolling and watching the Path glitter against the importance of grabbing every cool Gem you can and maximizing your shot at assembling each geometric solid.  You do the best you can.<br/><br/>Still, though, every time you select a Gem, there is some frustration.  Who knows for sure whether this Gem will actually help me?  Would another Gem have been better?  How soon will I find out?  Have I slowed my pace on the Path for nothing?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_361226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361226/#Comment_361226" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-21T19:04:02+00:00" title="February 21, 2012  7:04PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let me see if I understand the problem.

Well, think about chess. You're not looking at piece for its fixed characteristics. You're looking at it's position relative to other pieces, what it can do now, and what it can maybe do in the future. You're looking for patterns which you internalized during prior play. And each individual decision isn't a binary right or wrong. It changes the landscape of the relationships between the pieces.<br/><br/>So you have to make the choosing of a gem more complex. It has an impact on your ability to choose other gems, or on your ability to recognize the value in other gems. Maybe certain choices make other gems glow, providing information about their value to creating the jewel, or maybe certain choices make other gems fall of the path into an unavailable storm drain. Maybe certain gems are only useful to the jewel if you choose them in the correct sequence. Then maybe it becomes a game of skill.<br/><br/>Still doesn't sound like a fun game though. Making the complications compelling is the art of game design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_361312">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361312/#Comment_361312" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-22T09:32:26+00:00" title="February 22, 2012  9:32AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a game of skill if you can always complete <i>a</i> jewel, but <i>The</i> Jewel is the best possible conclusion.

The makers of the game don't have the time and budget to <i>individually</i> define the information contained in each of the millions of Gems.<br/><br/>Could the information be created arbitrarily on the spot?  That might provide the basis for some subsequent choice, but wouldn't seem to contribute to anything longer term.  Can we do better?<br/><br/>Could the information be deduced by referring to general rules about the classes to which the Gem belongs?  Teaching a pattern would be great, but the Gems themselves are problematic on this front, comprising every possible shape and color.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362487/#Comment_362487" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T16:15:11+00:00" title="February 24, 2012  4:15PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure I understand this 100%, but here's what I think:<br/><br/>As you collect the gems, you have to start combining them into shapes, testing the fit, etc.<br/><br/>But so are your competitors, and there is nowhere to hide: you must fool around with your gems on the Road itself, as do your competitors.

You're learning something about what strategies work and what strategies don't work by watching what the others are doing, and how well it works out. Maybe the gal who is picking huge quantities of gems at random has the biggest collection, but also struggles the most to actually get some of them to fit together?<br/><br/>2. You can broker deals with your competitors, exchange one gem for another, hoping it gets you ahead more than them. You need that one red piece, and your friend has got several.

If the other people on the Path are grabbing from the same Gems that you are, that means the results they're getting are equally inconclusive.  And if they were to, say, figure out how to build a geometric solid, then stealing or buying that solution isn't the same fun as achieving it yourself.<br/><br/>The pressure of competition might be a good thing, especially if it produces regular feedback by which you can measure your own progress.  But if the pressure is <i>just</i> about "first to the Gem", then all that does is tell you to sacrifice your other primary goal of the activity, which is to watch the Path glitter as you stroll along it.<br/><br/>I wonder... is this an issue of information bandwidth?  The worst solution is one that takes a ton of staring and poking to learn anything, and the best solution would be one in which a <i>small</i> amount of staring and poking returns you <i>lots</i> of info?<br/><br/>If that's true, that leads me back to my previous question to Paul C.: how do we <i>create</i> this information?<br/><br/>Letting multiple agents mine the Path's info at once and then compare notes similarly requires a more info-rich Path: one that can answer my questions and yours simultaneously.  For the sake of this project, consider that to be "additional information in need of creation" as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362687/#Comment_362687" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-26T09:37:40+00:00" title="February 26, 2012  9:37AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Look through the gems at the path.

Let me think this through:<br/><br/>I don't think standing in one spot is viable unless looking through the Gem provides what you get out of movement, which is progress along the Path, past different Gems than the ones where you are right now, toward a geometric solid.  So, if looking through a Gem gave you the ability to look into the distance or the future, that might work.  Afterwards, you'd probably want to be transported to edge of what you'd already seen so you didn't have to do it twice.<br/><br/>An equivalent idea that's much easier for me to envision would be to keep walking, but with a translucent Gem over your eye, coloring everything you see.  So you still get the glitter and the variety and the progress, but all of that stimulus doubles as info about the Gem over your eye.  And when you want info about a different Gem, you swap.<br/><br/>Of course, seeing everything through a filter you don't yet perfectly understand serves to <i>add</i> uncertainty to everything you're seeing through it.  Perhaps the key is to return different <i>types</i> of information, to minimize interference?  So instead of staring at Gem 2 on the Path and seeing "red and round", you stare at it through Gem 1 and see "red and round and happy", which tells you that Gem 1 is a happy-maker, and happy-making is a basis for decision for Jewel selection.<br/><br/>Perhaps if Gem 1 is sharp and blue, this is a clue to me that sharp, blue Gems are more likely to be happy-making, which can guide my choice of what Gem to pick up next.  "Sharp + blue = happy" is the kind of info I was inquiring about in post <a href="/forums/search?Search=%238&amp;Mode=like">#8</a>.  How do you manageably cover all your bases?  It's problematic, but hopefully not insurmountable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362730/#Comment_362730" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-26T13:03:49+00:00" title="February 26, 2012  1:03PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 26, 2012 1:08PM by David_Berg.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul Czege</cite>We unconsciously recognize good games by the learning opportunities they represent.

(Actor &amp; role.)<br/><br/>One objective is to select a set of A's that meet criteria X (Actors never appeared together.).  Whether a given A meets criteria X is a challenge of knowledge and memory.  This knowledge is valued by the social group.  It is something most players will have and share to some degree.  Remembering it is neither trivially easy nor impossibly hard.  <br/><br/>(In case I'm losing anyone: Knowing who actors are and what movies they've been in is valued, as it's handy for hanging out and talking about movies.  Watching movies is common, though different people will have seen some of the same ones and some different ones.  Remembering who was in what movie can be easy or difficult.)<br/><br/>The other objective is to select a set of B's that meet criteria Y (One of each).  Whether a given B meets criteria Y is obvious.  This adds complexity to the selection of Gems: not every Gem whose A meets criteria X is automatically viable for selection.<br/><br/>A and B share a common topic.  Any A can serve as a specific example of the B it's paired with.  As such, past associations are invoked, aiding recall and lending familiarity to the goal.<br/><br/>(Oh, that actor also played bad guys!  I remember now, that dude from the Professional!  That's Gary Oldman!  So, we're assembling a movie with Depp as the hero and Oldman as the badguy, I could see this being like The Devil's Own, sweet.)<br/><br/>Paul, do you think that sums it up?<br/><br/>Testing a counter-example:<br/><br/>Each Gem has a different atomic symbol on it and is in the shape of a different state of matter.  You need to collect a liquid shape, a metal shape, a gas shape, and a salt shape, using only elements with different numbers of free electrons, to make the Jewel.<br/><br/>Unless you're playing with a very geeky group, you'll have trouble remembering Sodium's electrons, and you're unlikely to get applause and "oh yeah, that's right!" when you do remember.  Unless your group enjoys talking about elements, they won't care at all about the info for its own sake; they'll value it only as a means to an end (the Jewel).  Even leaving out group dynamics, racking your brain over the periodic table is less appealing to most players than racking your brain over movies.  <br/><br/>In the end, instead of winding up with an evocative combo of actors and roles, you have a hydrogen-based liquid, an iron-based metal, an argon-based gas and a chlorine-based salt... which I guess you could imagine as a corrosive, steaming mass if you really wanted to.<br/><br/>So the appeal of the "faces &amp; roles" solution isn't inherent to the formal process of the challenge, but rather is contingent on the values and associations it taps from outside play.<br/><br/>If I have that right, I'll have to ponder whether it's possible to enjoy the glitter of a Path made up of actor faces.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364511/#Comment_364511" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-02T04:12:58+00:00" title="March  2, 2012  4:12AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Additional observation: much of the information needed by the game is stored outside the game.
