Strong leaders would come and go,<br/>but in the chaotic realm then known as the "Thousand Cities" no one<br/>could carve out a kingdom for long. Then came the Orgoth, an evil<br/>imperial race from beyond the sea that would change the face of<br/>Western Immoren forever, and pave the way for the Iron Kingdoms to<br/>arise. Aye, anyone can read the Corvis Treaties, that fostered this<br/>Iron Kingdom, for themselves' but the most important deals were never<br/>set down on paper. The IRON KINGDOMS were born of bloodshed and dark<br/>dealings, and so shall they fall.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>I LOVE the setting of Iron Kingdoms.<br/>Iron Kingdoms meets every want I have as a GM.<br/><br/>Iron Kingdoms uses 3.5 rules.<br/>I'd like to ask the group that gathers to play if they're interested<br/>in adopting any of the Pathfinder upgrades or other changes, but I'm<br/>happy with the IK rules as is. IK 3.5 isn't specifically vanilla. IK<br/>adds to and alters some rules to fit the setting. It has it's own<br/>Monsters and PC races and classes and "buy-in" level, in that there<br/>aren't very many books or loads of info to learn is fair/equal for new<br/>or familar players.<br/><br/>WHY IK IS COOL?<br/>Iron Kingdoms is billed as "Full Mettle Fantasy". Another way to say<br/>that is D&amp;D-steampunked.<br/>I like that steampunk-victorian style but at first I was reluctant on<br/>how it'd "break" my enjoyment of classic D&amp;D. What I've found is that<br/>in IK magic is much MUCH more common that the tech, however that<br/>"science" is strong. Some are dabbling in merging the two for what's<br/>called "Mechanika" and gadgets. It is a world of grit, sorcery, and<br/>steam where the tides of progress push the kingdoms into a bloody war<br/>for faith and fealty. Consider the higher levels of "tech" relegated<br/>alot to the rich/nobles or the gearheads. Most normal folks live<br/>amongst it but don't deal with or understand it. Magic is definately<br/>the go-to options for now...<br/>So you can be as powerful as any "traditional" D&amp;D hero with the<br/>additional options to build and adventure with custom warjacks,<br/>unleash the power of arcane firearms, become nearly indestructible<br/>with steam-powered armor and equip your characters with all manner of<br/>gadgets including mechanikal limbs.<br/>I plan to build some cool world-shaking epic plots/stories in which<br/>your characters will become KNOWN. But in general - in your<br/>adventures... anything in a classic D&amp;D campaign can/will happen as<br/>well as exploring the intrigue, suspense, and adventure awaiting them<br/>on the crowded streets of thriving renaissance/victorian style<br/>cities/ports full of of pirates, history, mercenaries, gambling halls,<br/>intrigue, and politics.<br/><br/><br/>Sources allowed:<br/><br/>* D&amp;D 3.5 core books (PHB, DMG, MM)<br/>* all Iron Kingdoms core books (see IK website for what's out)<br/>* any other sources would have to be read/studies/approved by DM<br/><br/><br/>For detail info...<br/>Iron Kingdoms website:  <a href="http://privateerpress.com/ironkingdoms/default.php?x=about" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://privateerpress.com/ironkingdoms/default.php?x=about</a><br/>Iron Kingdoms wikipedia article:  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Kingdoms" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Kingdoms</a><br/><br/><br/>happy holidays<br/>best,<br/><br/>-kev-                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184143">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevin.weiser" title="kevin.weiser"><img alt="kevin.weiser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.finitesite.com/spiderlegs/wlkngI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevin.weiser">kevin.weiser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184143/#Comment_184143" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-18T13:14:27+00:00" title="December 18, 2008  1:14PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            9am to 5pm?

No... we're not *that* hardcore.  <br/>I just tend to over-estimate times, to make sure everyone's cool with blocking out their Saturday morning/afternoon.  We generally only game from 10-3 at the most.  If we gather for 6 hours, it's about 4 hours of actual in-game fun.  <br/><br/>I hope this was/is a good place to "recruit" for game, I looked but didn't see any other place here.<br/><br/>-kev-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
