This is my big recent realization.<br/><br/>In most situations, the PCs simply outgun the opposition. At first, I was concerned that I wasn't providing enough of a challenge. But then I realized, as long as I manage to do some damage to them before the enemies either die or flee (I have pretty robust morale rules; most things don't particularly want to fight to the death), I've done my job. They rely on the town's cleric to make healing potions for them, which she does once/week. The number of days that pass between adventures is the average of the remaining HP of the party at the end of a (successful) adventure. So damaging them even moderately makes them take a significant hit to their resources. And eventually they will run into something *truly* nasty...<br/><br/>Meanwhile I get to play my weak-ass NPCs to my utter limits of cunning and tactics. It's fun! But it really is more like being an overwhelmed low-level OD&amp;D character.<br/><br/>Matt                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428197/#Comment_428197" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-10T20:20:19+00:00" title="February 10, 2014  8:20PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt,<br/><br/>Explain more about the weak-ass NPCs, and how you're playing them!

I end up sacrificing a bunch of them, just to get a few in close enough to get in some good hits on the wizards. And yes, some of the monsters feel like low-level OD&amp;D d00ds.<br/><br/>Any of the better NPCs, I'll use to try to hit the most powerful PC with an incapacitating spell right away. But their saves are pretty good, so it often doesn't work.<br/><br/>I'm sticking pretty strictly to the content of the (excellent!) Rappan Athuk megadungeon module, which is why I'm not just swapping things out for more powerful enemies. The bad stuff is deeper in; they're still in the above-ground areas.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
