If the end delivery is in another town, it could even be a nice bit of foreshadowing.  Or if like others have mentioned, it brings in some good moral questions, then it might work really well.

My opinion, is that D&amp;D trains people to solve problems, quickly and without moral ambiguity. I think my town had 8 extremely  <i>complicated </i> complications, and the PCs found the need to chase everything down and hit it with a hammer in that, "rush to initiative" sort of way that games like Shadowrun have trained people to play.<br/><br/>It was exactly what you'd expect from gamers who are used to killing orcs with magical fire.<br/><br/>They did however have a great time and two of the players would certainly be suited for playing again. But it's funny to me how hard it was for them get out of their chairs and author their own games without burning down the entire town.<br/><br/>Sigh. I forget what my point was now. I'll post an AP soon on a new thread, since this went no-where.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96578/#Comment_96578" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-16T11:15:48+00:00" title="September 16, 2007 11:15AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jim pinto</cite>I think my town had 8 extremely<i>complicated</i>complications, and the PCs found the need to chase everything down and hit with a hammer in that, "rush to initiative" sort of way that games like Shadowrun have trained people to play.</blockquote>\nJust set moral pitfalls for them to stumble blindly into and cackle with glee <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>Glad the game went well.,                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96872">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96872/#Comment_96872" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-17T09:37:25+00:00" title="September 17, 2007  9:37AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/><br/>thanks, no clue. i forgot about what an important role morals play in dogs.<br/><br/>i was really confused there.<br/><br/><img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>seriously, these D&amp;D guys steam-rolled over morals like paladins killing baby orcs.<br/><br/>one of them actually collapsed a mine to kill two non-believers inside that they "believed" were evil, even without proof.<br/><br/>more later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96968">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96968/#Comment_96968" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-17T14:13:37+00:00" title="September 17, 2007  2:13PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            :P<br/><br/>Well, my point wasn't to school you on morals in DitV. It was to point out the sheer pleasure of hitting them with the consequences of their actions after they've done em. That mine they caved in, didn't the townsfolk need that mine and the income it produced? What are they gonna do come winter with mouths to feed and all? Those two non-believers they killed, don't they have wives and kids who are now fatherless? Maybe now its their 10 year old son that comes at em with dad's revolver and they gotta gun down a kid in the middle of the street. Or maybe they got brothers and uncles and friends who come down at night and start killing off the Faithful men, women and children as retribution for there deaths. It ain't pretty.<br/><br/>If they won't pay attention to morals on the front end, I say hit em on the way out. But, it sounds like everyone had a blast. So, cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
