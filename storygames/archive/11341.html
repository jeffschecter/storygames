That little seed got my wheels turning and before long I was thinking seriously (yet again) about a game set in that world.<br/><br/>One of the things I like about <i>Blade Runner</i> \u2014 full disclosure: it's my favorite movie and I love it like I would an old, dear friend \u2014 is that it's so full of detail that I almost feel like I could walk away from Rick Deckard's story and just get lost in a whole other world with any one of hundreds of different stories going on.  That to me is an indicator that it's a solid setting for roleplay: you don't <i>need</i> Deckard and his plight in order to game.<br/><br/>With that in mind, I'm going to fish for plot hooks and story ideas because I like to see what people come up with.  And because I like to steal, of course.<br/><br/>The first thing that comes to mind, of course, is the blade runner unit.  We see two blade runners in the movie \u2014 Deckard and Holden, natch \u2014 but there must be more.  And escaped replicants must be a serious issue to warrant having a whole squad devoted to their pursuit and retirement.  That alone makes for a good basic set-up and allows direct exploration of the movie's core issue of humanity and what it means to be human.  But that can't be all of it or people are going to fell like they're just replaying the film with different characters.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Irishvince" title="Irishvince"><img alt="Irishvince" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/464/n77MQHB4WLBHG.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Irishvince">Irishvince</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252009/#Comment_252009" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-22T08:27:42+00:00" title="January 22, 2010  8:27AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 22, 2010 8:30AM by Irishvince.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You might want to check into this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Recall_2070" rel="nofollow">Total Recall 2070</a> Tv show.

With that in mind, I'd <em>love</em> to play replicants in the off-world colonies. Stories about the humanity of slaves are severely lacking in our larger cultural canon. Cuz I bet the off-world colonies suck hard for everyone. Their primary advantage is that they're better than dead Earth, where there's no longer an ecosystem.</p>\n<p>It occurred to me the last time I watched it (we have a similar relationship to the movie) that, with Tyrell dead, the only people capable of making replicant minds are replicants. There's some interesting gnarl in there. Maybe replicants are the future of humanity. Maybe their 4-year lifespan is a huge advantage. With generations going by that fast, they'll outpace humanity in just a couple of years. I mean, Roy is one of a <em>line</em>. There are more just like him, also figuring out their own biomechanics, also figuring out their own emotional responses, also figuring out their moral universe. No other ones can kill their creator, but I bet they're out there, coming up with their own solutions.</p>\n<p>... and therein lies an interesting game that is both canon characters and not. You can play Roy, Priss, Zorah, Leon, or a bunch of other models that are built for particular functions. You have your own names, of course, but you're played by Rutger Hauer, Daryl Hannah, et al. No reason to believe there couldn't be multiples of each of you. A whole bunch of Prisses, taking over the brothel and generating a mother cult. An army of Leons leading a worker revolt. An infiltration team of one Roy, one Zorah, taking over the entire universe.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252087/#Comment_252087" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-22T12:28:02+00:00" title="January 22, 2010 12:28PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fuck Roy, he's a MacGuffin with lines.

Sure, there are artificial beings running around, but the murder (and surrounding events) isn't necessarily connected to that fact. Instead, it's about personal issues and massive conspiracies intersecting in this case. The SF setting let's you exaggerate current issues (such as corporate control, government cover-ups, or the underclass) and explore them through the crime story genre.<br/><br/>Of course, I key into cybernoir heavily on color while I key into crime stories on thematics, so take all this with a grain of salt.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
