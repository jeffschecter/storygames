Then I realized that it supplies an awesome variant system. Just use a deck of cards. 1 draw = 1 die. Red cards are successes, black cards are failures.

Then I realized that it supplies an awesome variant system. Just use a deck of cards. 1 draw = 1 die. Red cards are successes, black cards are failures. It even approximates rolling sixes (if you need them) by counting 4 cards as 6s (the game uses 10,J,Q,K). Are you aware that Vince <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/storming/?p=86" rel="nofollow">abandoned that rule</a>? I think he may have decided it was too hard to keep track of whether a given card was a red, green, blue, or white success.<br/><br/>If you stay away from abilities that trigger on a 6 (in <i>Storming</i>) or don't use shade (<i>Burning</i>), you can use coins (pennies for red, dimes for blue, nickels for green, quarters for white), or poker chips with distinct sides (get some green ones). For the purposes of <i>Storming</i>, you can approximate 6's by having using one distinctive coin per three in your pool - maybe every third penny is a euro-penny, and every third quarter is an old one rather than one of the redesigned state quarters (or is a <a href="http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/intentio.htm" rel="nofollow">quarter balboa</a>). I don't have a good way in mind to do die shade with coins ("reflip every other/third failure" maybe?).<br/><br/>Or you can just decide that it would be cool to be able to play <i>Storming</i> and <i>Mechaton</i> and <i>Burning</i> as written and buy those quite reasonably-priced Chessex 36-packs. You'll need two of them for <i>Fiasco</i> anyway, which you will be legally required to play when it comes out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247510/#Comment_247510" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-18T11:20:03+00:00" title="December 18, 2009 11:20AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite><cite>Posted By: Steerpike</cite>And I think a "proper" BW die would have to be</blockquote>Nah, sell 'em as a set.<br/><br/>Black dice with 2 big dot sides and 1 cross side<br/>Gray dice with 3 big dot sides and 1 cross side<br/>White dice with 4 big dot sides and 1 cross side<br/><br/>Make sure to sell them in equal quantities so the white and gray shifted dice can stare at us, like little eyes coming out of dicebag.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247512/#Comment_247512" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-18T11:23:17+00:00" title="December 18, 2009 11:23AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Datapoint 1: the Dice from Milton Bradley's Heroquest have 3 Skulls, 2 Shields, and 1 Monster emblem.

And we have a potentially exploding die at a chance of 16.7% so we need to be able to tell these apart from a regular success.<br/><br/>So, how about we take a regular cube with six equal sides - we can make it from any material, really, as long as it's structurally and statistically sound - then carve symbols onto it that map onto the five different cases above (obviously one case, guaranteed success but not exploding die, will have to map onto two sides of the cube).<br/><br/>But then how to create suitable symbology, to make people from many different cultures and background able to determine success from failure? Ah, your resident genius has thought of this as well. I propose that we utilize symbology originating from the world's most universal language, mathematics. Most everyone in the civilized world will recognize the numerals 1..6, which will represent boundary cases one would have to reach to achieve the effects outlined above, depending on one's shade. However, to make the game accessible to a less mathematically advanced audience, I suggest instead that we represent the numerals as easily countable dots. In fact - and hold on to your hats, boys and girls - I suggest that we organize the dots in arrangements which, after having played for some time, will be instantly recognizable as <i>de facto</i> symbols on their own for easy recognition.<br/><br/>I guarantee that this method is statistically in line with the game's expectation and provides a suitably close to optimal play experience to be considered "perfect".<br/><br/>Anyone who'd like to use this idea can feel free. The genius is feeling generous today.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247525/#Comment_247525" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-18T12:07:31+00:00" title="December 18, 2009 12:07PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And, yet, as it turns out, the handling time is greater with pips than with (frex) Fate dice (which are basically Gray-shade dice that can't explode), Hero dice (which are basically White-shade dice and explode on a 2-Body result)... or the custom BW dice that folks have bought and love. I've got YEARS of Hero experience, and coutning up Body still takes longer with normal, pipped d6s than with Hero dice.<br/>-----<br/>The abstract, color-specific dice would be faster handling, sure, Ryan. Problem is, most folks almost never need gray, and I've never read an AP where someone rolled a white. That makes it tough to just say "sell them as sets to 10 dice of each shade." (Or similar) What I'd want, if the shade changed the die faces, is a way to buy, like, individual Whites, maybe sets of ten Grays, and sets of twenty Blacks (which are also BE dice). THEN, going out to buy that extra White when I increase the exponent of a White stat would be, like, going to get a trophy or some-such!<br/><br/>But 10dWhite? I'd probably NEVER roll them all, ever.

It rocks, in fact.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog" title="Z-Dog"><img alt="Z-Dog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog">Z-Dog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247538/#Comment_247538" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-18T14:12:40+00:00" title="December 18, 2009  2:12PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 18, 2009 2:13PM by Z-Dog.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll add two more:<br>\n<br>\nbecause getting to add more dice to your roll is awesome...or is it? those fuckers could come up as traitors, you know! <br>\n<br>\nalso:<br>\n<br>\nbecause everything's calculated up front BEFORE you roll...so when the dice hit the table, it's all results, baby: WIN!

There's some negotiation there, as each skill brought in potentially colors the possible outcomes. Maybe the pool grows a little.<br/><br/>Help is asked for or offered, accepted for refused. More dice trickle in.<br/><br/>The GM might have an advantage die to offer.<br/><br/>The player then considers whether to spend Persona on the roll, to add a few more dice.<br/><br/>Only now are you ready to roll.<br/><br/>This physicality of assembling the pool can be used to great effect. As an example, in a Burning Sands: Jihad game, the players needed to make a very difficult roll. It was obvious they were going to need to do alot of prep work to make it possible.  so I plunked an initial group of dice down in the center of the table "That's your starting skill".  Then for the next hour or so we did lots of roleplaying involving linked tests. Dice got added or removed from the pool.  Each time, I pointed at the pool and asked "are you ready to roll those yet?"  It made for a very satisfying build up.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247573/#Comment_247573" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-18T22:03:38+00:00" title="December 18, 2009 10:03PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247574/#Comment_247574" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-18T22:30:25+00:00" title="December 18, 2009 10:30PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 19, 2009 1:14PM by ccreitz.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Nice"?

For the particular scheme used, each standard deviation away from 0 is 20/3 (i.e, 1 standard deviation above 0 is +6, 2 standard deviations is +13, 3 standard deviations is +20). The way the dice are used is essentially to randomly generate the digits of a number between 0 and 1. Normally, 2d10 are rolled just like you would roll percentile dice (except 00 is 00 not 100). So the pair of dice produce numbers from .00 to .99. The roll is then compared to a chart that produces the modifier. At the tails of the chart, two digits are not enough resolution, so additional d10s are rolled to add more digits, for example, if a 00 was rolled, two more dice would be rolled, resulting in the decimal number now being between .0000 and .0099. The chart we use is rendered to have two digits past any string of leading 0s or leading 9s, I have used a chart that goes out to +- 40 (6 standard deviations).<br/><br/><a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=12583.0" rel="nofollow">Here's a thread on the Forge with more details</a><br/><br/>Back to Burning Wheel though, part of the key is just how BW uses the dice pools, and open ended rolls.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
