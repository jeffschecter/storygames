There was<br/>such an incredible amount of great gaming that went on this weekend that I have to say, it was probably the best<br/>convention experience I've ever had.  I also got to meet a lot of new people this year and was able to put some faces<br/>to the names I've seen on here for awhile.<br/><br/>Some highlights for me:<br/><br/>* Tales of the Fisherman's Wife: The creepy dead ghost baby caught in the fisherman's net.  Thanks, Matt.<br/>* Misery Bubblegum: Watching a gay/straight love triangle somehow spring up around a character that started as a <br/>one-dimensional NPC in our first story. <br/>* Trail of Cthulhu: Greta Garbo chanting over a dodecahedron in a not-yet-finished observatory in the Hollywood hills.<br/>* Freemarket: THIS one really stands out for me: going crazy trying to copy a teddybear-biomorph based on my character's <br/>ex-boyfriend, and watching as they all come out of the matter printer shouting recriminations in unison.  <br/>And THEN getting frownied.<br/>* Cold Sleep: Watching the holographic resurrection of our dead psychologist trying to explain to the ship's priest that<br/>he shouldn't care for a robot as if it were a real person, completely oblivious to the fact that she now considers herself<br/>human.<br/><br/>What were your favorite moments (both gaming and non) that happened at this year's Dreamation?<br/><br/>-d-                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_193606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193606/#Comment_193606" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-22T20:58:54+00:00" title="February 22, 2009  8:58PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My favorite moments were:<br/>* Krista's "Why now?" question in <i>Under My Skin</i><br/>* Earning loud applause and contemplative silences for my own scenes in the same game<br/>* Daniel's painful reveal that Sergeant Ram (in <i>carry. a game about war.</i>) finished up numerous re-ups in Vietnam, returned home, became a police officer, and people quietly whisper that he probably beats his kids<br/>* Finishing a <i>Verge</i> playtest without it exploding -- we're getting close, baby<br/>* Sitting and talking and drinking with many friends, old and new, in the hotel lobby until the late hours                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_193610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193610/#Comment_193610" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-22T22:04:11+00:00" title="February 22, 2009 10:04PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2009 11:25PM by Remi.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            * The pie eating contest against Bottomless Ocean during character creation in Do: Pilgrims of the Flying Temple<br/>* Basketball-games-as-emo-conversations in Misery Bubblegum.

The entire con felt like one big reuinion with old friends, even though, for most people, I'd met you twice, once, or never.<br/><br/>2) The playing:<br/><b>1st Quest</b>: I refused an order I deemed dishonorable, and then was told I'd passed a test.  A great unplanned synergy of responsive ad-lib.  I worried I'd derailed the plot, but Judd found a way to make it push the plot forward.<br/><b>Don't Rest Your Head</b>: killing the horrible truth with desperate lies; fighting an evil symphony that was never finished; blasting a feeble silence monster with jet engine-volume kazoo shrieks<br/><b>Grey Ranks</b>: a girl asked to kill for the cause, flashing back to her friend beating her up in a crazed rage, and executing the messiest assassination ever<br/><b>Houses of the Blooded</b>: Matt drunkenly yelling he'd steal the Duke's property -- as a diversion for us stealing the Duke's property, a still-beating heart in the shrine of a saint-in-waiting<br/><b>PtA: Cold Sleep</b>: the techie struggling for status improves the creaky robot -- to the point where it can replace him<br/><br/>3) The ideas and designs-in-progress:<br/>The way relationships and status change (or threaten to) with respect to various contexts during resolution in Bill White's <b>The Great City</b>.<br/>The way caveman color and adventure meshes with family squabbling in Dave Cleaver's <b>Prehistoric Ties</b> to produce a combo of reflection and hilarity.<br/>The way Anna, who's been gaming for 7 months, got the whole roundtable crowd stoked with her idea for a game about creating a new religion by living through what will be its Bible.  (Someone suggested <b>Writing Exodus</b> as a title.)<br/>The way Mendel is finding better and better applications for his <b>Coming of Age</b> system ("illegitimate sons of James Bond cleaning up dad's mess" got a huge reaction).<br/>The roundtable forcing so many cool ideas on Ryan Macklin that he had to reconsider his decision to give up on his <b>Addiction</b> game (I didn't catch the title).<br/>Brainstorming the best ways to turn scene objects into action movie props for Matt Weber's <b>Showdown</b>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_193743">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Oh, and a chilling denoument scene in carry where not a shot was fired and nobody died.  <br/><br/>I also love that I think I ranted and wildly gesticulated at Rachel Walton for something like 15 minutes straight about my awesome-in-my-own-mind-but-completely-dead-and-buried Burning Empires game (and threatened to abandon my home and family and move to Philly to play in hers), and yet she *still* talked to me later on, rather than, say, obtaining a restraining order.<br/><br/>Plus, 50% of the new rules to Misspent Youth are awesome.  And I obviously miss out by turning in at 2AM like a putz rather than raging on with the rest of you guys.  But even with my lame-ness, I got to discuss the difference between *bad* games and *morally degenerate* games (and whether anyone has ever read F.A.T.A.L., or just the hilarious reviews), the chances of the ANC in the South African elections, how my peacekeeping game would just have you walk up to Khmer Rouge guards every 24 hours and ask them nicely to move their stick, and how to create stories where the "important" stuff is done by super-powerful NPCs (like Lilith, Admiral Ackbar, or Henry Kissinger), but which aren't de-protagonizing.<br/><br/>I'm sure I'm forgetting awesome stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_193819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chadu" title="chadu"><img alt="chadu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/chadu/pic/0003ch8e"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chadu">chadu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193819/#Comment_193819" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-23T20:32:16+00:00" title="February 23, 2009  8:32PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Three tables full of SHOCK on Saturday night.<br/><br/>WTF+Awesome!<br/><br/>You go, Mr. Newman.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_193821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193821/#Comment_193821" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-23T21:06:41+00:00" title="February 23, 2009  9:06PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, did I miss out!<br/><br/>Next year, gadget!

We settled on making it look like it had fallen from a supply helicopter or truck to avoid suspicion. Then, with perfect comic timing, Paul goes, "When they come, we should jump out from behind and yell "Supplies!!!"' I nearly cried from laughing which made narrating the follow-up failure rather difficult.<br/><br/>*Misery Bubblegum: as with Remi: all of it. We squeezed in three episodes which really started to flesh out our characters and their world into this super-entertaining teenage soap opera. One amusing exchange involved two girls angsting over the secret that their friend was gay (and the impact it would have), but he'd told them in confidence separately. "Are you ok? What's wrong?!" "I'm not supposed to say! Do...do you know?" "I'm not supposed to say!"<br/><br/>*Jeepform: Happy Ends: Kevin Allen Jr. playing a super-awkward, defensive, sexually-confused teenager with an imaginary friend. Brilliant and absolutely hilarious. <br/><br/>*Jeepform: The Upgrade: all of it! My character was pretty flawed going in, had some fun, but hit new lows, took a bad record deal, and didn't get picked by anyone. Thanks to the epilogue monologue, though, she actually ended up ok in a way that totally made sense. I did not expect that, and I love how this game surprises me.<br/><br/>*Grey Ranks: Whoa. We all rolled so poorly in our third episode of the session that despite drawing on everything we held dear, we achieved a Total Party Kill. I think my favorite moment was just before the the Grey Ranks destroyed themselves. Ryan's character Slaz is meeting my character Nina in the rubble of a park. They're both in a really low place after the relationship between them hasn't been working and so much of their exhausting progress in the Gray Ranks has been for nothing. He puts his arm around her and she slumps into him, letting him carry the weight of her world if only for a moment. It was really subtle and touching.    <br/><br/>*FreeMarket: <i>totally</i> earning the Frownie my friend gave me for kicking him when he was down. I'm such a jerk. <br/><br/>*Shock: seeing the above-mentioned Mike go from being nervous about his "traditional" gaming backround to an Antagonist with Robert DeNiro acting skillz. Neat!<br/><br/>*In a Wicked Age: using my serpent demon Queen NPC to seduce her son's girlfriend before giving the poor couple her blessing.<br/><br/>Also:<br/>*Super yummy palak panir and rosemary naan!<br/>*Conversing excitedly about Burning Empires on more than one occasion to Daniel, Thor, and several other poor innocent bystanders!<br/>*Sneak-attack and flank hugging!<br/>*Serious and hilarious conversations about Jeepform with Tobias, Emily, and Terry! Jeepform miniatures! It's all KAJ's fault!<br/>*It was all good - it really, really was!
