                    Why isn't there a mighty game for playing NINJA? And I don't mean "REAL ULTIMATE POWER" parodies, nor do I mean ninja burger. Rather, I want a game that let's you and your players feel like you are these powerful assassins, and ideally, the author knows a little bit of actual ninja history and simply expands it to be slightly fantastical, meanwhile ducking over-orientalization.<br/>
<br/>
So. Any contenders?                </div>

<a href="http://www.itesser.com/games/horiku/" rel="nofollow">House of Horiku</a> by Annie Rush springs to mind.  It's definately a light little game, so it may not scratch the historical itch, but it's all about the ninja.  And sexual politics.  And cool diagrams.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            This reminds me of a great series of 'choose your own adventure' style books from the 80s, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Way_of_the_Tiger" rel="nofollow"><em>The Way Of The Tiger</em></a>; that was done 'straight', helped by putting the ninja in a fantasy world so they were less superhuman in context.  I still have those books buried in a box somewhere <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>It would certainly be doable as a story game theme, and I'm impulsively tempted to add it to my list of too many games to get around to some day.<br/><br/>One thing that springs to mind as a possible limitation, though, would be the notion of ninja working alone rather than as groups.  As I recall, what limited historical information there was suggested that teams would be the norm, rather than lone individuals (much like modern special forces etc work as teams rather than a first person shooter-style super commando!), but most ninja fiction seems to be about the lone assassin.  So it might have to be one of these two player games for a player and GM if you wanted to evoke that fiction, or you would have to go far beyond the ninja stereotypes to be able to create a team of individuals with varied skills rather than interchangeable supermen.<br/><br/>Hmm, my mental cogs are turning...                        </div>

                            The game that's come closest to the ninja feel, for me, was (surprisingly) a computer game:  <i>Thief</i>.  The main dynamic of the game is its stealth mechanic:  for all intents and purposes, your ability to kill enemies is directly correlated to how well you've snuck up on them or (more commonly) hidden in just the right place to have them walk past you.<br/>
<br/>
One of the first challenges of the game is to find the right patch of shadow to cling to in order to have a guard walk right past you ... then you walk behind him, matching his foot-falls, until <b>HE</b> ends up in the right patch of shadow for you to take him out without anyone noticing.  The overpowering sense of fragile superiority ... of being in a position that is <i>intensely unfair</i> because you own this guy 100%, but still <i>totally just</i> because if you ever got noticed you'd be dead in seconds ... massive wish fulfillment.<br/>
<br/>
I'd love to see that translated into a tabletop ruleset.  Yep.                        </div>

                            Graham - I thought of Blackguard actually when I saw this, having read your draft rules the other day, it's an obvious variation you could make perhaps with assassination as the goal rather than theft.<br>
<br>
Tony - That atmosphere is something I've been keen on seeing in a tabletop game as well; I find the Splinter Cell series to be similar in that regard, with a proper emphasis on stealth and clever play rather than direct combat.  I've been trying to figure a way of capturing that in a board game for a while and more recently as a structured rpg/story game model.                        </br></br></div>

                            Thief. Splinter Cell. Oh my yes.<br>
<br>
Those games have dominated my mental landscape for years. When I'm describing something in a game, I'm always, "It's like in Thief, with the crazy rooftops and metalwork..."<br/>
<br/>
The original Tenchu (for Playstation) was a full-on ninja game that delivered. It was kind of a proto-Thief, in several ways and had the kind of sneaky fun that Tony describes. The sequels aren't so great, though.<br/>
<br/>
This post has no content. I am just affirming my love for those great games. Also, I know, deep down, that I have a Splinter Cell RPG in me somewhere. This thread has me thinking hard about it again.                        </br></br></div>

                            Hey, game love is perfectly good content!  I have Tenchu, as well, and was also disappointed by the sequels; obviously there's a stealth-em-up sweet spot here that we're both talking about <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>
<br/>
Have a look at Graham's <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.catchyourhare.com/journal/?p=26" rel="nofollow">Blackguard</a>, it would work well for a Tenchu-style ninja game with a few tweaks.  Meanwhile this thread is getting me all thinky about digging out my Splinter Cell board game notes and seeing if there's a foundation for an rpg in there somewhere...                        </div>

                            I like Blackguard. (Enough that it gave me "Metal Gear Solid" flashbacks.) It has some of that feel going on.<br>

We could turn this thread into a wishlist of things a game should have in order to support straight-up ninja, Southpaw, what do you think?                        </br></br></div>

Steve, I hadn't heard of those before.  While they look nifty, I have to say that one of the things I like about popular depictions of the ninja is that they <i>are</i> comparatively superhuman.  Not unbeatable or perfect, but certainly more than a match for their enemies when the balance is tipped in the ninja's direction (usually by stealth).<br/><br/>That said, I'll have to poke around my local used book shop and see if I can't find one of these.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenchu:_Stealth_Assassins" rel="nofollow">Tenchu</a> is a great game.  I've played entirely too many hours of it over the years, and dip into it even now, despite its dated graphics and controls.  I'll agree that the second game was a complete waste, but it was designed by an entirely different group of people.  This may explain the sucking.<br/><br/>You might want to check out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenchu:_Wrath_of_Heaven" rel="nofollow">Tenchu: Wrath of Heaven</a>, if you haven't already.  It's a solid return to form for the series, and has the added benefit of improved graphics and analog control.  Probably nothing will ever dislodge the original from its special place in my heart, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenchu:_Wrath_of_Heaven" rel="nofollow">Wrath of Heaven</a> comes close.<br/><br/>Anyway, back to the thread: Dev suggested making a list of elements that my ideal ninja-centric game would include.  Bear in mind that I'm not a game designer, so perhaps my ideas are unworkable.<br/><br/>First and foremost, and this comes from repeated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenchu:_Stealth_Assassins" rel="nofollow">Tenchu</a> exposure, as well as unhealthy doses of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sho_Kosugi" rel="nofollow">Sho Kosugi</a>: there needs to be an instant-kill mechanism to the game.  Ninja are about stalking and killing swiftly, and I've yet to see a treatment where these things are integrated properly.  Is it unbalanced?  Sure, if <i>balance</i> only applies to combat matchups.  Ideally a ninja game would place the mechanical emphasis on the <i>stealth</i> aspect, so that the killing is the payoff.<br/><br/><b>NOTE:</b> Grr... still stuck blockquoting.  If someone with global editing ability could help, I'd appreciate it.                        </div>

                            You could build the whole combat system around instant kills, whether the ninja has been detected or not; give each character a defense level which you must exceed with maneuver points at which point you can instantly kill them.  Maneuvering for the kill is easier if the target doesn't know you're there or is distracted, and in a straight fight they are also maneuvering to kill you.<br/>
<br/>
For example a Samurai guard has a Defense of 10.  If you can make maneuvers to a value of 11 without being spotted you can silently dispatch him.  If he spots you, his Defense doubles to 20 and he is now also maneuvering to overcome your own Defense stat.<br/>
<br/>
Things like armour increase Defense by reducing the number of angles vulnerable to attack, but also decrease the ability to maneuver for attack.  Characters like Samurai can have access to traits and items like ultra-sharp katana which can reduce armour bonuses, while Ninja could have access to distraction items like smoke bombs to reducing their opponent's maneuver total if they are close to being defeated.<br/>
<br/>
So the kill is the final resolution of the conflict, but the conflict itself is about stealthy maneuver.                        </div>

                            It's funny, but the "instant kill" is an example I use in HQ about how to deal with the massively powerful wizard... that is, that a character is not just as powerful as their most powerful ability, and that true power is the willingness it takes to do what needs to be done to get a task accomplished. <br>
<br>
Anyhow...<br>
<br>
To address something from earlier in the thread... do people actually want to play historical ninjas? Do people really understand what they're asking for when they ask for historical ninjas? As opposed to what most everybody thinks of about ninjas, which is a load of mythology developed in American movies in the 1980s. Or even from Japanese media (like the fact that the idea that they dress all in black probably comes from how they're portrayed in Kabuki theatre). <br>
<br>
I'm not saying it couldn't be interesting, it probably could. I'm saying that it would probably just not be much like what people are expecting. It might be more fun just to stick to the emergent mythology. <br/>

                            I think there's a market for both and maybe a game could contain core mechanics which you then choose one of several versions of 'reality' to apply to.  You could choose historical, hollywood or a middle ground as your setting, with ninja characters as human, heroic human or superhuman, with modifiers to stat ranges and possible feats accordingly.  A result of +5 in a normal human, historical game would have a different narrative effect from a +5 in a superhuman hollywood game but in mechanical terms they would work the same way.                        </div>

                            Well I think suggesting that playing a sleeper cell would be dull is a bit of a straw man; you wouldn't play the years and years of nothing happening, you'd play the dramatic moments when the cell is activated, just like you don't play the years of working on the farm your fantasy hero did before taking up the mysterious old hermit's quest.<br/>
<br/>
I could actually see huge potential in a sleeper cell game, where character creation is all about creating people who seem as normal and nondescript as possible, then finding ways to twist that and reveal the "truth" during play as a way of creating and activating traits.  The game would generate a massive amount of conflict from everyone who thought they knew the protagonists realising that they really didn't ("Oh he was the perfect neighbour, very quiet, kept himself to himself..."), as well as from opposition to them attempting to undertake whatever their real mission is.<br/>

Absolutely, which is why I'm careful to wear my influences on my sleeve when it comes to discussing the subject.  As soon as say Sho Kosugi's name, everyone should be pretty clear where I'm coming from, at least.                        </br></br></div>

                            "Not what one expects from a ninja game."  could be a good thing, of course, to get the attention of people who would dismiss the theme.<br/>

"Not what one expects from a western" is fair comment on <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>, after all.                        </div>

That's kind of the thing I'm rebelling against here.  I'm not sure exactly how or when "ninja" turned into an automatic joke (Golan and Globus may be largely to blame), but I'd like to get clear of that.  Especially when there are so many of us who clearly have affection for the shinobi.                        </br></br></div>

                            Strictly speaking, a game about historical ninja is a game about samurai special ops (which would be kinda cool). Here are some historical resources.<br><br/><a href="http://www.ninpo.org/historicalrecords/bansenshukai.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.ninpo.org/historicalrecords/bansenshukai.html</a><br/><br/><a href="http://www.ninpo.org/historicalrecords/ninpidenindex.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.ninpo.org/historicalrecords/ninpidenindex.htm</a><br/><br/>There is some contention about the historical context behind ninjutsu (which, strictly speaking, has nothing to do with fighting techniques). Confirmed historical practices are usually a subset of a larger curriculum/set of strategies. The Tenshin ShÅden Katori ShintÅ-ryÅ« is known to have preserved some historical espionage techniques, but nobody knows exactly what they are because they're secrets -- and mostly irrelevant in the modern day. The Koga-ryu is extinct; the last known master was an eccentric named Seiko Fujita who didn't teach anyone. Meanwhile, there's a guy named Masaaki Hatsumi (the links above are for a site belonin to the Genbukan, a splinter organization of Hatsumi's tradition) run by a who claims to have inherited three ninjutsu traditions but there's no proof, though he is a legitimate heir to a branch of the Kukishin-ryu. When you research authentic ninjutsu you'll usually find his name, but he's not necessarily a trusted source. IIRC there are ninja reenactment/performance groups in Japan.<br/><br/>One of the things I wanted from Budo was a way to make a character by just transferring the curriculum from a historical school to the character sheet so I could take advantage of the massive amount of available trivia, but I personally am more interested in a cinematic style game.<br/><br/>Oh yeah -- there are gritty instant death rules there too if you set that "dial."                        </br></div>

                            There's lots of potential for drama in the the "sleeper espionage" story.  To take a genre-appropriate example, General Ikeda from Usagi Yojimbo.  He does pretty much exactly what Tony described after being on the losing side of a rebellion.  Of course, that's not where the story starts.  The story starts when the son of his sworn enemy (now his rightful lord) shows up in his hut, full of arrows and on the run from an occult conspiracy.  Fun fun fun.<br/>
<br/>
Which reminds me of The Blossoms are Falling.  Which reminds me that Burning Wheel could actually work pretty well for ninjas.  Just use straight up skill rolls until you blow the alarm, and then switch to Fight!  On the downside Blossoms has a strict "no ninja" policy, but it wouldn't be hard to make the lifepath(s), if one was in the mood.                        </div>
