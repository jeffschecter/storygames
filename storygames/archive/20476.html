Good question. Certainly it seems like there is no *objective* reason why that would be the case, although, then again, maybe there is.<br/><br/>However, it's been my experience that creating something which is extremely alien/unfamiliar and operates on principles different than we are used to is quite a challenge. Doing that on the fly, while maintaining high standards of coherence/internal logic, can be very demanding. c.f. Ry's "high level of fidelity maintained throughout" -&gt; I interpret that to mean that this is a high priority for Ry and his group. I could be wrong, of course!<br/><br/>I would feel more confident creating something consistent on the fly if it was supported more by basic expectations which were <i>shared</i> with the players, whether that was based in a) the real world, or perhaps b) simple genre tropes (like D&amp;D fantasy), given the right group. When playing in this style, we depend heavily on the player's ability to draw correct inferences, and, if the players can't rely on real-world knowledge or some other background, the burden lies with the GM. That can place a lot of stress on one person during the game. <br/><br/>I can imagine that thinking about all of that in advance, and taking some notes he/she can refer to during play, might give the GM greater confidence in this regard.<br/><br/>I'd love to hear the counterargument to this, however (and it might be helpful for Ry, as well).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450131">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450131/#Comment_450131" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-21T18:23:05+00:00" title="December 21, 2015  6:23PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Moving parts are interactive elements that the players won't immediately interpret as increasing or decreasing the pressure on them.

So this is half of the prep for a given topic. <br/><br/>But at other times I want to ease the pressure, or they're searching for and would reasonably find something useful. That's desiderata, a quarter of the prep. Assets, rewards, objects of desire. <br/><br/>Finally there are moving parts and texture which I detailed above. <br/><br/>Also the flip side of each page is for maps, NPC portraits and lists of names.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450141">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450141/#Comment_450141" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-22T06:14:30+00:00" title="December 22, 2015  6:14AM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is part of this thing a need for the players to feel like the world is "real"? In my game Nerver av st\xe5l it's very important to be consistent, since you're playing a film noir thriller/mystery, and there can be no loose ends. But the story is completely improvised. This is solved by two simple principles:<br/><br/>1: After each scene you write down any questions that have been raised in it. for example "What's in that bag?" and "Who killed Jimmy?". As the questions are answered, you cross them out. This document is crucial in keeping the game on track, making sure that no ends are left loose and that you keep a suitable number of questions in the air at any one time.<br/>2: Players are encouraged to stop the game any time they spot an inconsistency. You say "Hey, time out, you just said you didn't recognize the name, but we established in the beginning he's your brother. Are you bluffing or did you forget?".<br/><br/>These two principles do wonder in keeping the story consistent and tight. In fact, I've never played a game that gives such tight, consistent stories. This is a different kind of consistency that the one you're talking about here, but couldn't similar tools be used? I'm not convinced this play style is prep-heavy by necessity. I think a LOT can be solved through a proper procedure for documenting what's being improvised. Proper documentation is an underused technique.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450147/#Comment_450147" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-22T17:28:59+00:00" title="December 22, 2015  5:28PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, moving parts! I used them a lot when I started GMing, only I didn't called them that way. In fact, 80% of my prep consisted on moving parts, created according to what I thought players would do if they were presented with a situation using predetermined cues, designed to reduce the possible options to those moving parts. <br/><br/>It ended up turning railroady as each time I unconsciously reduced the amount of moving parts prepped and reinforced the cues, as players decided their course of action and focused in a specific part of the setting. Of course, it doesn't have to turn that way for everybody, I still think it was just my case. A lot of why I felt it perhaps more railroady than it was came from all the stuff I was reading on forums at that time. <br/><br/>Also, due to a particular session where impro with player aid became so good that it made me I throw all my prep through the window, I started to give credit to most of things said on the "Play Unsafe" book and finally decided to try more procedures and mechanics that could help me go that way.<br/><br/>That's why now my prep is 50% randomizers and "Mountain Witch"-like questions and techniques to get things out of players without breaking immersion (or doing in a tolerable fashion), then 30% trad prep with more detailed events which define a situation but leaves it up to the players how to solve it. Absolutely no moving parts, no "if"s, no "hmm, I should present things this way so players would thing that and do probably only X,Y and Z, all for which I can make a prep with detailed events, color and keep branching from there"<br/><br/>I admit the effect is cool as it boosts your narrative to be certain about what are you going to do next as a GM. Your voice and manners will transmit security and make the players feel like you are ready for everything. It's totally subconscious, and while subtle and absolutely not the intention of the GM to come of that way, it makes a day and night of a difference in the game.<br/><br/>Only other thing that compares to that is to have some training or practice on applied social psychology, NPL, public performing, acting or whatever helps you boost your confidence, react calmly and come out with creative and plausible feedback on the spot to whatever the players do/say/ask. That's kinda my specialty, so, not everyone's cup of tea anyway.<br/><br/>And even having that for me, I still favor prep over full impro, since pre-written stuff can be carefully edited before presenting it to the players (even if you just edit it a bit right when you present it to the players) dramatically improving the quality of the experience, specially if you're focusing on immersion.
