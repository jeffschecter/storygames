For those of you who haven't checked it out, it's basically a cyberpunk take on Lady Blackbird, with pregens and a suggested campaign. A very nice package all in all. I'm trying to change it a little bit before running it, so that's what I want to talk about, and that's why there's a <b>spoiler warning</b> in the title.... spoilers in 3, 2, 1....<br/><br/><br/>Basically, the premise is that the PC's are all cyberpunk street samurai types who all worked for the same mysterious boss-dude, back in the day. Then boss-dude disappeared, 11 years ago, and nobody's seen him since.  And now you're getting untraceable messages from him... time to get the band back together and do a series of crisply defined missions in various locations to figure out what's going on and where your old boss is.  Ultimately, it comes down to a choice of Maguffins: you either can do an extraction mission on your old boss, or on the Maguffin.  (Obviously, there's got to be a Maguffin.)<br/><br/>So, first of all, much love to Will Hindmarch for putting this all together and releasing it CC.   I love the Watchmen-like idea of heroes who've been sidelined for a decade and coming back to reclaim that power, and in the process getting another look at who they were back then and maybe re-evaluating the whole concept of cyberpunk heroes.  Um, that last sentence wasn't Will, it was me.  I guess I'd like to twist the premise a bit more, curdle the cream, put a sting in the tail.  What I'd like to do, without having to rewrite the whole damn thing which is overall excellent, is to add some more bitterness and betrayal to the mix -- something to make the players wonder about their boss and what they were all doing, 11 years ago.  I'd like to play with the bad guys a bit more, too -- the villains are the Technocracy (the one world government dudes with black helicopters) and an evil megacorp. <br/><br/>What I want to avoid: making the backstory so complicated that it bogs down, or makes the players feel gypped because they went in with one premise and are leaving with another which violates their sense of what the game is about.   <br/><br/>My ideas so far:<br/>1) Replicated bosses: One of the themes the game plays with is a kind of Phil-Dickian replication: there are various virtual and robotic partial copies of the boss-dude floating around, as well as several well-hidden AI's that he left running when he disappeared to take care of his essential business.  So I was thinking of cranking this up a bit and making the AI's copies of boss-dude as well, while making the original boss himself damaged.  Maybe he got shot up with some kind of horrible cyberpunk drug, or brainwashed, or just shot in the head -- but he's not who he was.  Eventually, the PC's might be in contact with 2 or 3 versions of boss-dude at the same time, none of which can agree on exactly what happened, or what the master plan is. Very postmodern -- the past is fluid, and you have to make sense of it in the present without ever being sure you've got it right.<br/><br/>2) The boss is a traitor: This is a bit of a film noir or <i>Total Recall</i>-like twist: it turns out that the boss-dude is now secretly working for one of the villains, and that the whole story -- everything from the beginning of the game, when the PC's get reactivated, all the way through, has all been the boss-dude using the PC's to deliver the Maguffin into the hands of his faction.  There are reasons why he couldn't just go after this directly -- maybe borrowing a leaf from idea <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>  that he 's lost some of his important memories, or that some of the people he needs help from no longer trust him, so he's got to use the PC's as untainted and unwitting co-conspirators.  <br/><br/>3) The boss is a villain: in this one, it gradually becomes clear that the boss-dude is not a good guy, and probably never was; his whole idealistic fighting-the-man act was just a way to get smart idealists like the PC's to work for him, cheap.  In this version of the story, he's in hiding from the authorities and is using the PC's to get the Maguffin so that he can use it for his own nefarious ends, maybe just selling it to the highest bidder in exchange for his freedom and One! Million! Dollars! or in his own evil scheme.  This version seems the most problematic because, 1) as GM I'd have to hint that the boss-dude is not such a good guy without making it too obvious, 2) it implies that the PC's were morons, since they were working in good faith for a crimelord 11 years ago and never figured it out.  But maybe this plot could be used as a distractor from <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> or <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, with an NPC Technocrat trying to convince a PC that boss-dude is dangerous and that they should give the Maguffin to the government.  <br/><br/>Will never actually says anything about what the Maguffin does or is good for; I like that.  It shouldn't come up until the end of the game, anyway.<br/><br/>Any thoughts on how to twist the story to make it darker and more bitter?                  </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421669/#Comment_421669" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-19T09:36:49+00:00" title="September 19, 2013  9:36AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like you're on the right track, honestly. I like option 2, the traitorous boss, maybe combined a bit with the replication from option 1. What if he <i>used to be</i> secretly bad but his new iteration is trying to atone for it? Then the PCs are discovering the real ramifications of what they did all those years ago, but get to be the good guys now.<br/><br/>Either way, for slowly unfolding double-cross mysteries, I suggest the story/NPC connection generator from <b>Technoir.</b>It's really inspiring, and tailor-made for this sort of thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421672/#Comment_421672" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-19T11:51:37+00:00" title="September 19, 2013 11:51AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 19, 2013 11:52AM by J_Walton.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My main issue with A/N/N is that I don't really care about the pre-determined plot very much. The characters and setting and flashbacks and other stuff are all awesome, but I was expecting something more like Lady Blackbird, where the initial situation was pre-determined but then the characters would be cut loose to choose their course of action and deal with the ramifications of their decisions, rather than following a rabbit hole to discover pre-determined clues about the plot, ending in a big reveal that just doesn't seem all that important. I mean, honestly, the plot and the motivations and past deeds of the boss seem much less interesting than the choices the characters (who are, after all, the protagonists) decide to make. I have plans to run A/N/N, but -- like you -- I'm going to have to do some work on it first, and the first step in that process -- for me -- is going to be throwing most of the plot out or converting it into a hook. Like: "The boss that you used to run jobs for is missing, the megacorps are searching for him, and he has all the dirt on you that anyone can ever possibly need to track you down and make your life hell. Can you piece together the clues he left behind and find him (and help him? kill him? mindwipe him? steal his secrets?) before the corperations and their hired goons do?" Then, bam, we're off and running, and can figure out everything else as we play, while still using the scene setup and controlled sequence that Will lays out (can't unlock some locations before you get info on them from previous locations). What is the boss's deal? I don't know: I'll ask the players questions about him and piece it together from their responses and what happens during the game. Anyway, that's what I'm thinking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421673">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421673/#Comment_421673" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-19T11:55:08+00:00" title="September 19, 2013 11:55AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's pretty cool!
