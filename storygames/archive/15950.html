This makes sense, as we were taking part in the Battle of Hu\u1ebf and that was kind of a big deal.  As I expected the game to be more about soldiers and their feelings, as opposed to flying lead, I can definitely say I came away from the game with a markedly different perception of what it was all about.<br/><br/>I remarked to Adam afterward about the combat heaviness of the session and he pointed out that the tactical aspects of the game were largely there for flavor and didn't reflect themselves in the mechanics of the game.  In other words: no calls for initiative, no back and forth dice-rolling about who hit whom, no anything that remotely resembles typical military combat in RPGs.  This got my wheels turning.<br/><br/>Like many of us, I enjoy action in my games.  What I enjoy less is the sheer amount of fiddly stuff that generally goes along with it.  I find I've grown increasingly impatient with systems that require me to absorb a mountain of rules just to have a firefight and am much more interested in abstracting that part of it, perhaps to the point of boiling things down to two or three rolls per combat.  <i>carry</i> took this to an extreme, but my game of <i>Remember Tomorrow</i> (played the same day) also jettisoned typical combat mechanics.  Stuff still <i>happened</i> and it was exciting, but I think it was more exciting because it was freed of the grid-based, tactical play that usually typifies that sort of thing.<br/><br/>So let's say I want to play out some kind of <i>Act of Valor</i>-style action \u2014 note: I have not seen <i>Act of Valor</i>, but have a pretty good idea of what's in it based on everything I've read/seen \u2014 but don't want to break out something like <a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=17690" rel="nofollow">Blood &amp; Guts</a>, which will entail a lot of rolling and ruling and general bookkeeping.  What do I use?  I'd almost rather, at this point, take <i>Apocalypse World</i>'s mechanics out for a spin than face rolling another d20.  <i>Apocalypse World</i> is not a perfect fit, but at least it breaks down the fiddly bits to a bare minimum.  I thought maybe Otherkind Dice might do it, as it boils things down to specific goals, as opposed to action-by-action resolution.  Is there something better?<br/><br/>I welcome your input.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362880/#Comment_362880" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-27T07:28:30+00:00" title="February 27, 2012  7:28AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well...there's that military hack of Apocalypse World by some dudes from SG which isn't quite available yet.<br/><br/>Maybe you could repurpose 3:16?<br/><br/>I also wrote a dice-pool based WWII-ish game some time ago, not sure if I have a presentable draft...I can dig something out later.

I guess it's because I immediately think, "That's for WWII," when I think of it.  But if it works for WWII, there's no real reason it shouldn't work for other wars or special operations.  I guess the biggest problem might be the prescribed character roles.  I'm no good at doing stuff like making up playbooks, and that may very well be necessary in this case.<br/><br/>That said, I'd certainly be interested in what you have, assuming you can find it.

If you want to keep it simple, stick to the Explorer Edition (which, at $10, is an excellent deal) and skip the Deluxe.<br/><br/>Only thing I don't really like in Savage is the unskilled checks, so I ended up making a matrix with the standard stats on one side and jobs on the other. I slotted the skills into the matrix and gave the players an array of die types to assign to the stats and another array to assign to the jobs. So instead of rolling the standard wild die, you roll your stat+job. For mook npcs, I used the same chart but only assigned them stats, since mooks don't get the wild die.<br/><br/>Using the matrix fixed the other slight silliness in Savage - Shooting is one skill, but Riding, Driving, Piloting, and Sailing are all separate skills, even though in a system that uses a lot of movie logic, those skills serve exactly the same purpose - you use them for either pursuing or escaping with a vehicle in a chase scene. With the skill matrix, I didn't need people to separately buy up those skills, though I did put some of them in different cells in the matrix. If anyone had been interested in making a focused vehicle user, I would have let them buy an Edge that would have added to all the vehicle skill rolls, but it was a fantasy game and vehicle use didn't come up a lot - just a couple horseriding checks here and there.<br/><br/>Savage Worlds covers tactical combat with a fun, streamlined system. The system is derived from a squad-level minis wargame system, so the combat is intended to be run quick and smooth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362934/#Comment_362934" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-27T10:54:19+00:00" title="February 27, 2012 10:54AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite><i>Savage Worlds</i> covers tactical combat with a fun, streamlined system.

I remember there were a series of caves or graves in an open field where they were surprised by Japanese (their special ability was "attack from surprise"). About halfway through the adventure they watched a Marine fighter/bomber go down in the hills and had a confusing search in the jungle for the pilot before the Japanese got to him. I think they found his arm or his head and brought it out. Oops.<br/><br/>There were also higher-ups yelling at them over the radio and making all sorts of unreasonable demands.<br/><br/>Because of the way the token system works out and the time taken to make characters, I believe we only had 3-4 skirmishes in a 4 hour session. But the group seemed to enjoy it a lot. There was a lot of "the brass is trying to get us killed, let's get the job done OUR WAY." They really played up the character personalities. I remember adding something in from The Shab-al-Hiri Roach or The Mountain Witch about asking each of them which guys have your back and who doesn't. Which through a fun monkey-wrench into the group dynamic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_363633">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noah_D" title="Noah_D"><img alt="Noah_D" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noah_D">Noah_D</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363633/#Comment_363633" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T20:20:24+00:00" title="February 28, 2012  8:20PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Caesar_X, your WW2 Pacific mod of 3:16 inspired me to do my Vietnam one.<br/><br/>That 'who's got your back' bit...may have to use that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363645/#Comment_363645" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T20:47:21+00:00" title="February 28, 2012  8:47PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Noah, if you are doing Vietnam, you might find <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6644" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> interesting.

Let me explain ...<br/><br/>I thought about combat in rpgs for many years, since the late eighties, and discussed it extensively. It was a frustration to me and my gaming-buddies that combat was slow, abstract and unrealistic, even though most games had a lot of rules on it. And no one did anything about it! I had the feeling that even though it was discussed by many, and moaned by a lot, no one ever made a foray into unknown territory; designing methods to simile the elements and effects in combat between humans in a more realistic and/or believable way.<br/><br/>In 2003, being thoroughly sick of discussing it, I finally bit into the sour apple, and made such a method myself. I were surprised by how easy it was to make an effective method. And doubly surprised by the sheer force of interaction it created. <br/><br/>Here's the two main ideas:<br/>- <b>rules</b> are doing the abstractions, so too much rules will lead to abstraction<br/>- <b>people</b> acting, reacting and getting into emotional states, is the heart of combat<br/><br/>Leading to these general conclusions:<br/>- <b>less rules</b> are good for combat, so we need a fast conflict-resolution, as abstraction really sets in when everything is slowed down by die-rolling, and when a heavy conflict-resolution get in the way of fleeting character-interaction and interpretation<br/>- we need to <b>help players describe/immerse in</b> their characters, as these act, react and gets emotional. Use of subjective point of view, speedy narrative techniques and impulse-driven interaction, is the best help to players in a combat. A fast and impulse-steered method goes a long way in mimicking the churning chaos of men in mortal melee.<br/>- we need to <b>slow down afterwards</b>, to make room for the aftereffects. Reflective scenes is of pivotal importance to the believable portraying of how men reacts to the realities of battle.<br/><br/>On the basis of these conclusions I created a new method for combat, in my classical fantasy role-playing game <i>Fabula</i>.<br/><br/>The method worked like hell! It led leaders and players into hard-hitting and furious imaginary battles, full of grit and blood and chaos, rage and angst, self-doubt and sorrow, and a sickening feeling that the reality of taking lives is indeed grimmer than anything. We had no problem immersing in the physical effects of it, the emotional states created by danger and hurt, the moral implications, and the social effects of being a "heroic" murderer. We left the tables of such battles with grit in our minds.<br/><br/>I believe our experiences with the <i>Fabula</i>-method are very close to what you describe, Sam.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364510/#Comment_364510" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-02T04:10:49+00:00" title="March  2, 2012  4:10AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 2, 2012 5:53AM by Sam!.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tomas, I hadn't considered that the problem WAS abstraction, as it seemed like rules-heavy systems were overly concerned with  minutiae.

Perhaps the Doctor Who and kids thread?<br/><br/>Anyway, those rules were also very light and fast to use. He designed them that way for some of the reasons Tomas mentions ( not the emotional ones, the speed of play ones). They're worth looking at and considering.<br/><br/>Having said that, RPG combat rules tend to suck because of their roots.<br/><br/>It isn't that their roots are in wargames, it's because their roots are in a specific appoach to wargames.<br/><br/>It's called a Bottom Up approach, and for some niche-y wargame thinkers ( as thinky as folks get around here with regards to RPGs/SGs), they are also the bane of play. When you talk about fiddliness, you're talking about stuff coming out of that Bottom Up school of design thinking.<br/><br/>There are other schools of thought on the thing. Top Down Design is one ( and obviously, the opposite of Bottom Up design), although i don't know if that will help you with what you're looking for, because I'm not entirely sure what you're looking for in terms of action.<br/><br/>If you were to be the one running something, I could offer some suggestions on approaches. Unfortunately, I don't have much I can point to, have you buy or print out, and hand off to someone to run else to run for you. The closest I can think of is Mythic GM Emulator, with some kind of document made up to indicate the sorts of things (like genre tropes) that you're looking for that you can hand around or stick on a wall so that everyone is on the same page and has a common reference point for inspirations during play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364535/#Comment_364535" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-02T06:23:35+00:00" title="March  2, 2012  6:23AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 2, 2012 6:23AM by Sam!.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>There are other schools of thought on the thing.

We were <i>doing things</i> and stuff was blowing up and people were getting shot and there were tanks and grenades and all that good stuff, but at no point did we have to do things like consult the Grenade Blast Radius Table or work out where every single bullet went.  Things <i>flowed</i>, in other words, and didn't have that fiddly, stop-start total lack of momentum that a game running on the d20 engine might have, for example.<br/><br/>I'm not averse to rolling dice or even doing things like tracking damage, but I prefer not to have to break out rulers and calculators to figure out what's happening around my character.

I'm not sure if i could write it up in any useful way to hand off. The suggestions certainly wouldn't be commercially viable as a product ( which does, admittedly, make me a bit sad).<br/><br/>I'll also tell ya straight up that my own approach to it would be loosey-goosey as all hell, and more method than mechanics.<br/><br/>I'll also tell ya that i tend to think in terms of minis use. Because I like little toy peoples, not becaause I like fiddly grid or measure bullshit. How you can translate the stuff for non-minis use would be on you, although probably not hard at all.<br/><br/>Right now, try a brainstorming experiement. If you have index cards handy, it might work better but any amount of scrap paper or a notebook would work fine.<br/><br/>Okay, here's the deal. Think infantry centered combat in the Viet Nam War. Think of every cliche, trope, and bit of realism/gun porn you can imagine. Start writing that stuff out. Anything at all, and it can just be a single word that acts as a mental reminder. Categorize a bit., like wite down "helicopter" and three things about helicopters as it relates. Or, M-16. Or Jungle trail.<br/><br/>Whatever, just burp it out on the page. Then, get expansive. Write Viet Cong. or Ambush. Or Draftee. Or War Protest. ROTC Lieutenant. Segeant. Radio Commo. Artillery Mission. Booby Trap. Tunnel Rat.<br/><br/>Just let your brain go.<br/><br/>By the time you're done, you'll have a bunch of stuff.

That's all on the GM. I've been GMing D&amp;D and other games since 1980, and I have internalized a lot of this stuff. Without actual "rules to get in the way," I can lean on my 31 years of GMing experience and make stuff happen in an aesthetically pleasing way.

You could also probably brainstorm pges of single word or phrase stream of consciousness stuff the same way, so let's skip ahead a bit.<br/><br/>I'm going to take a guess that what you'd enjoy is Hollywood VNM informed by some kind of actual history.<br/><br/>I don't know that for absolute sure, but it sounds like it, so let's start with Hollywood War Movies in general. The flavoring in this case is Viet Nam flavoring, but you'll see relation to other classic war movie stuff as well.<br/><br/>First off, you start with characters, and generally you don't now too much of anything about them at all. You know a rank, maybe a last name, a couple of easy stereotypes they seem to fit with. That's pretty much every war movie ever. So go with it.<br/><br/>As the film goes on, characters become more effective at whatever they do as we learn stuff about them. Conversely, there's a sort of weird balance effect; They're also more likely to get killed or maimed, or weirdly, pull out something miraculous from nowhere or dodge certain death. Andit could go in either direction a any time, and it almost doesn't matter what it is we know about them or what they're attempting.<br/><br/>A cowardly ratfuck, cheating, drug addict, black marketeer and the bold young Looie from Boisie who always writes his best gal back home both work under these constraints/abilities. And the more we learn about them, the more nuance we have about that character, the more true this becomes.<br/><br/>How would I work that? Hrm. I like old fashioned d%. I'd give a main character a simple 50% score as their only stat, roll low to succeed at whatever they needed a roll for called by the GM whenever appropriate. As the game progressed, I'd let the players as a whole group kinda give some little 1% stat bumps, a bit like Fan Mail in Prime Time Adventures after a scene/story chunk/whenever somebody especially the GM calls for it, especially if more was revealed about the character. Yes that does mean that if five people total are playing, a given character might bump anywhere from +0% to +5 after a scene.<br/><br/>It could lead to some fast upgrade on that score, but here's the kicker. On failure, especially in combat, the score flips to a negative thing. Roll again, and if you roll under the stat, something dumb and catastrophic happens. What exactly is up to you and the group. Over the stat and something bad, but less horrific happens. This tends to be when people die, either the character themself or someone they have an attachment to around them and it's almost certainly their fault.<br/><br/>As for comabt results and weaponry, I'd make it pretty damn simple and random. A bit more detailed for PCs, less for known friendly NPCs and almost totally random and abstracted for enemies, especially for firing into the bush and night combats. I'd skip anything like Hit Points or Heath levels. Make up some simple charts and use those. People are allive or dead or screaming wounded or incinerated, or are soon to be dead but don't quiteknow it yet, or shitting themselves and quaking or whatever. it all kinda happens at random, doesn't it?<br/><br/>As for combat, it's all kinda just color. You'll have enough knowledge of gun porn/tactics porn to make some good guesses at when various times to call for rolls just <b>should</b> occur, and the nature of possible results will always be defined by what is going on and not much else. Play it loosey-goosey and run with it. Don't bother with modifiers at all, just let the situation at hand and the scope of things you're dealing with define the roll.<br/><br/>How loosey-goosey? <b>Very</b> loosey-goosey. That guy with a stat of 85% can do stoopidly heroic stuff if that's his inclination. He'll probaby pull it off all the goddamn time, right up until he fails that roll, it flips, he rolls low, and the random combat results table you've made up says he catches a bullet through the brain pan.<br/><br/>As for the enemy, they're mostly color too. Everything gamewise is kinda sorta from the POV of the PCs. It ain't that Charlie is going to roll dice to hit, it's more like charlie is part of a hostile situation and the PCs are rolling when necessary to survive and defeat that situation, at least temporarily.<br/><br/>If i was feeling lazy, which is normal, and i was GMing, I'd probably just secretly roll a d6 or a d10 (if I wanted to stick with d10s, because i've been using them for d% anyway) before a story chunk and use that as the number of major threats in whatever was about to happen next, and let context guide me. If i was feeling somewhat fair, i'd pre-choose half of those, and reserve the right to pick the other half as things went along and they seemed appropriate.<br/><br/>Like this: The general chapter idea is a patrol and a semi-scheduled visit to a strategic village. I roll a d6 and come up with 4 things. I'll choose two: A booby trap along one of the likely roads to the village and a small cadre of three armed, dedicated VC in the village itself who have been propagandizing the locals to turn them against the Saigon government and the American troops. i'll save the other two to be a bastard with. Maybe there's a friendly VC squad nearby not in the village waiting in the bush for their pals. Maybe there's a reporter in the village who's anti war and you didn't know it ahead of time. Maybe one of the PC's contacts in the village or their Kit Carson scout has flipped. Maybe one of the squad members has a local girlfriend that's in the village and she's got some tings she needs to talk about, like an unexpected pregnancy.<br/><br/>Whatever, I'll be a dick about it anyway. The players will figure it all out through play.<br/><br/>And that's pretty much it I guess.<br/><br/>Method wise, i'd steal david berg's action arc thingie as a tool. Me being me, i'd use a bunch of minis because, Hey, Minis!!<br/><br/>I would piss about too much with range measuring and time representations and that kind of crap. Even if you do use minis, take a page from Tomas' approach to combat as hectic, scary, bloodthirsty, and chaotic and run with it.<br/><br/>All that brainstormy stuff is just there for the GM and the players to work in for inspiration, whether for creating characters, developing characters, or for background to missions and non-combatty stuff. It's a big idea soup to go back to that everyone has access to if they want it.<br/><br/>Now, if you want more practical details on how all this loosey-goosey stuff would work in actual play, hit me back with an exampple question or two, whether about combat, character development, or overall adventure/campaign stuff, and i can give you an idea of how i'd approach it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364714/#Comment_364714" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-02T16:34:07+00:00" title="March  2, 2012  4:34PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing that I never see in RPG's that is really, really big in actual combat is the confusion of actual combat.

It's not the only way of doing combat in the game, as the game caters for a whole lot of different fictional styles, but for the sessions were you want serious immersion in the horrors of war, the method I talked about in my last post is the thing.<br/><br/>My biggest surprise when I finally got to sit down and do the war-module for Fabula, was the simple solution it demanded. It was strange to think that we had been frustrated with this for so many years, and had listened to so many people telling us that the old way was the only way, and then the solution was so close by. <br/><br/>My conclusion is that a lot of "truths" in role-playing should be investigated with critical eye. A player/leader/designer of rpgs should boldly go forth and seek out new solutions to any problem he/she has with how role-playing games are played at present. Such practice is to the betterment of all role-players, and is THE best help in developing the form of role-playing games!

Ever played <i>Shadowrun</i>?  Or really any traditional RPG with a detailed combat system?  It's stop, start, stop, start with lots of calculating going on to account for armor and ranges and degrees of cover and blast radiuses and initiative checks and on and on.  If you're familiar with Third Edition D&amp;D (the last edition I played), just think of how difficult it was to simply grapple an opponent.  That's all fiddly to me, as it gets in the way of the things you really want to do, which is take action and see results.<br/><br/>Your proposed resolution mechanic admirably strips all that <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">bullshit</span> stuff out and gets down to those essentials: do I succeed?  Do I fail?  What are the consequences of either result?<br/><br/>There was a time in my life when all I played were games with fiddly bits, from the aforementioned <i>Twilight: 2000</i> to <i>Merc</i> to (God help me) <i>Phoenix Command</i>.  I tolerated it because to <i>not</i> tolerate it meant there was no game, but now we have options available to us as players and GMs and we're not trapped by all those tables and calculator-demanding mechanics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364850">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364850/#Comment_364850" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-03T10:22:45+00:00" title="March  3, 2012 10:22AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just realized I didn't answer the question.  Oops.<br/><br/>A combat encounter that's non-fiddly would allow me to make tactical decisions and execute them with a roll or two without the need to reference tables or jumbles of numbers.  <i>Apocalypse World</i>'s "Going Aggro" kind of fits the bill, as it serves as a sort of catchall for aggressive action that results (usually) in harm being done to the opposing side.  As a player I still get to make meaningful decisions, but I'm not juggling a mountain of statistics every time my character makes a move.<br/><br/>To use Adam's <i>carry</i> game as an example: the rules of <i>carry</i> basically only say whether soldiers are wounded or killed.  There are no damage tables or cover systems or anything that would typify a fiddly game.  So when we made decisions, they were meaningful to us in that we were engaging the enemy, but absent that layer of... well, <i>fiddliness</i> that would bog things down in a more complex system.<br/><br/>I'm very curious to see how <i>The Regiment</i> handles this kind of stuff, given its roots as an <i>Apocalypse World</i> hack.  It may very well distill things down just as effectively and I'll have exactly what I want.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364871/#Comment_364871" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-03T12:36:26+00:00" title="March  3, 2012 12:36PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bit tangential, but I must say I was actually disappointed by carry's combat rules. You have to write fireteams and squad leaders out, as the grunt (PC) with the highest rank is in command of all grunts regardless of what team they are part of. You can't tell what happens to fodder (NPCs) until the whole battle is over, so you can't narrate deaths or anything. The connection between the players' decisions and the outcome of the battle felt really flimsy because of the weird resolution mechanic.<br/><br/>I wanted to like carry. I really did. But the mechanics just consistently produced worse fiction than the stuff in my head. I'm fine with the romantic rather than realistic approach, it's actually liberating to not care about history and go with stuff that's evocative. But the rules don't really produce Platoon or Full Metal Jacket naturally. I admit my players and I didn't bring their a-game to the table and I didn't use burden die mechanics at all, maybe the game failed to communicate something important to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364872">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364872/#Comment_364872" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-03T12:38:38+00:00" title="March  3, 2012 12:38PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, as Adam said earlier, his experience running the game may have helped.

One of the big things we've (especially 'I've') been working on is a smooth, easy transition from the 'I want to play this, but...' stage to 'man I have all this Lego, where did all this Lego come from'.<br/><br/>There will be instructions, parts suggestions, design advice, and at the end of the day if all else fails, you can poke me and I'll poke back with help. Build some block-bots and dive in!<br/><br/>Hmmm . . . A smooth easy transition might be exactly what it takes to sell me on this game . . . Sadly I don't have any my LEGO on this side of the country. Does this "smooth transition" include a strategy for slowly accumulating those fiddly bits you need? I like that the Kickstarter seems to have options to include those bits, but it's expensive and I'm going to want AT LEAST 2-3 different teams of robots (to accommodate other players who may not have LEGOs).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Military action without all the fiddly bits - Page

So-so.  There's a goodly amount of mechanical stuff to remember, as the characters are expected to become seasoned over the course of play and are therefore less likely to freeze up and/or do something stupid when the bullets start flying.  You don't necessarily need maps (though the game suggests you use one), but there are so many modifiers and qualifiers and general fiddliness that any benefit you get from not using maps is lost anyway.

Sorry, Sam, I completely spaced this one. Here's my review:<br/><br/>There's some interesting mechanics in this - Panic (FNGs will most likely do nothing useful the first time, but they will get better), Stress (a building stat, which when combined with a Horror test, can lead to going right back to FNG-level panic and uselessness), reducing Stress through roleplay. Task resolution is pretty standard. There's more fiddly bits than I'd like - weapon effective ranges are given in meters, making map use somewhat necessary. <br/><br/>The author's initial recommended reading (Dispatches &amp; Nam) led me to think this is going to be more like carry than Recon, as those two are more narrative than historical. This isn't bad, mind, but it does take a position within the popular memory, not necessarily the (inordinately complex) reality of the war. The bibliography in the back is broader, however. Game-style-wise, this is more Recon-lite than carry-Realistic. It's not a bad medium between the two, though.<br/><br/>(There's a pretty serious technical error in the description of the M16. While this might appear to be only of interest to gun nuts, the repetition of 'conventional wisdom' is a bit troublesome, coming from someone who wrote a book about the war from the result of his research for the game.)<br/><br/>The information about Vietnam and the environment (both social and physical) is rather good and useful. <br/><br/>All in all, it's not bad - useful as a light sourcebook, and some ideas for scenarios. For a brief overview of an Aerorifle/Airmobile unit in Vietnam, you could do worse. If you're a dedicated Vietnam roleplayer, it's worth it. If it's not your focus, probably not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_371494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371494/#Comment_371494" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-05T17:24:40+00:00" title="April  5, 2012  5:24PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting feedback on <i>Grunt</i>.

I guess it's easy enough to do if you ignore a chunk of the game, but it's pretty clear the author wants specific stories told about specific men and I'm not really keen on that much prescription in my play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_371581">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noah_D" title="Noah_D"><img alt="Noah_D" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noah_D">Noah_D</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371581/#Comment_371581" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-06T12:37:42+00:00" title="April  6, 2012 12:37PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I could see that being a problem.
