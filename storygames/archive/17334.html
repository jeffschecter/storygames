We got funding to produce a pilot with professional actors, camera crew etc. We're going to use the pilot to help get funding for a full season through Kickstarter.<br/><br/>Before we can start production on the pilot though, we need two things: a digital artist to produce art (for this episode and each recurring episode) and a fantasy game to use as the RPG that the group plays with throughout the series (there will be two RPG's featured in the first season).<br/><br/>Another producer talked about getting D&amp;D for the show, and I'm sure that we could get permission to use their products just as The Gamers: Dorkness Rising did, but I told him that a major goal of this project is to grow the hobby, and the best way to grow the hobby is to help those who contribute to it and show what else is out there to play that the masses don't know about. Thus, I want to use independently developed games in the show as often as is possible.<br/><br/>If anyone has a game, or knows of one, with good art that would likely be willing to let us use their product (we'll link to their site and talk about the game in making of videos), please let me know. Also, if anyone is willing to help us with art for the project, please send me a link to some of your work.<br/><br/>Thanks for your help guys.<br/><br/>(Moderators, if there is a better spot for this post, please move it there. I looked, but I wasn't sure where it would fit best. Thanks.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392722/#Comment_392722" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-08T11:14:07+00:00" title="October  8, 2012 11:14AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 8, 2012 11:14AM by Hans_c-o.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool!

So there's less of the character/player connection over time to explore. But still totally great. It films well, as evidenced by the episode of Tabletop.<br/><br/>With Dungeon World, there's so much crossover with D&amp;D that, for viewers familiar with D&amp;D who haven't heard of Dungeon World, they might just think the show characters were playing D&amp;D wrong.<br/><br/>I would suggest Monsterhearts over Dungeon World, when it comes to AW hacks. Tons of great potential there for crossover issues between character and player relationships, assuming that you're including some typical dysfunctional group elements. Also, people in some other threads here have produced some visual elements (cards and such) that would look really good on screen.<br/><br/>Sorcerer might work really well. Lots of moral issue play that would be fun to explore.<br/><br/>Having them play The Quiet Year would play well to the visual elements of video. Or How To Host A Dungeon. For the same reason. Drawing things during play would translate well to screen, I would think.<br/><br/>Dread would be neat. Scary stories plus Jenga. Or even Dread House, which would tone down the horror elements a bit and increase the visual appeal, since it has board game elements to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392751/#Comment_392751" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-08T13:58:53+00:00" title="October  8, 2012  1:58PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In general, I would suggest looking at how Wil Wheaton's Tabletop show uses graphics on the screen to help the viewer keep aware of what is happening in the game. That sort of element might help for times when what is happening in the show is tied closely to what is happening in the game at a mechanics level. <br/><br/>Not that you necessarily have to break into full screen graphics, but you could do some sort of overlay or something. Just a thought that might be worth considering.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392755">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RyanDanks" title="RyanDanks"><img alt="RyanDanks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RyanDanks">RyanDanks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392755/#Comment_392755" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-08T14:05:33+00:00" title="October  8, 2012  2:05PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those are great ideas, and I'm really interested in Dread/Dread House.

Mostly, the game is the backdrop and catalyst for the issues they have to deal with. Kind of like The Guild, where the game is seen only rarely and the story revolves mostly around the dysfunctional players.<br/><br/>I'll check out Monsterhearts - never heard of that game.<br/><br/>Thanks for that contact, TildeSee.

It's easy to learn, so your cast can actually really play it and not just fake it (Burning Wheel has a much sharper learning curve, in my experience). It's relatively easy for observers to watch and have a sense of what's happening.

Beliefs can get... kind of personal, in an RL kind of way! Especially with players that highly identify with their PCs (which is sort of a risky way to play BW, as the GM is supposed to push at them hard).<br/><br/>Would <i>Spirit of the Century</i> be fantastic enough? You might be the first to go to the pulp genre (qua gaming) in a web series (as you know, you are far from the first to go to D&amp;D/high fantasy).<br/><br/>It might help to know to what extent the system engagement is going to be featured. I mean, for D&amp;D4E, a HUGE majority of the table talk is around granular positioning, very specific rules and terms, etc. Fun to watch if you know it and the players are knowledegable and skilled; confusing as hell if you don't (much like the difference between two baseball viewers: one who understands all those pitching and hitting stats and in on the edge of their seat every pitch; and one who only watches for the big plays and doesn't get all the "slow, time-wasting" stuff).<br/><br/>Some systems (BW is largely one; Fiasco is utterly one) really drive in-character conflicts, dialog, and vivid descriptions and, thus, even if "the rules" are being discussed, it's more like "OK, that's Ob4" or "don't forget to get +1 die to maneuvering for having the longest weapon" or "you keep that die in Act II, remember"; and they don't distract much from the surrounding drama.<br/><br/>So, yeah... GREAT to see such a project coming; obviously, you're at a site with it's own darlings and demons (hey! my new fantasy heartbreaker is born!); and without really knowing the RPG's role in the show's narrative, it's hard to make effective suggestions.<br/><br/>BUT... given this general point about the game-as-show-element:\n<blockquote>We don't spend a huge amount of time in game. Mostly, the game is the backdrop and catalyst for the issues they have to deal with. Kind of like The Guild, where the game is seen only rarely and the story revolves mostly around the dysfunctional players.</blockquote>\nI'd have to repeat <i>Burning Wheel</i> as a possible ideal choice:<br/>* High fantasy (or dark, or gritty-city, or low and realistic... Setting setup is a BIG deal, as is what emerges from player choices and character Beliefs)<br/>* Beliefs often "bleed' out of the game into RL<br/>* There's enough mechanics for play style conflicts (i.e., the grognard/power gamer vs the story's-the-thing guy)<br/>* It's GMful, so you have that central authority that many viewers will expect and against which some (all?) of the players can push. (And a BAD <i>Burning Wheel</i> GM is *really* bad, as PCs can't advance without the story flow aligning with their Beliefs, Instincts, and Traits.)<br/><br/>Hope this helps;<br/>David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RyanDanks" title="RyanDanks"><img alt="RyanDanks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RyanDanks">RyanDanks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392858/#Comment_392858" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-09T10:32:49+00:00" title="October  9, 2012 10:32AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree. The ease of use, and the popularity, of Dungeon World lead to it being the desired game early on. I've sent messages to the developer already. Nothing back yet, but I'm anxiously awaiting response.<br/><br/>Looking up Monsterhearts was lots of fun. The script calls for a second group of LARPers who play a darker game (written with WoD Vampire in mind). Monsterhearts looks like it could be a lot of fun for that. And since you said it is based on the AW engine, it would be easy to learn the rules for the cast and viewers who choose to play both of games featured in the season. IMO, LARPing can be done with any rules system, so it doesn't exactly require Vampire, despite how well known that product is in the LARPing community.<br/><br/>I'm more looking forward to season 2, which will give much more leeway to feature different games. Because of how the script is written, we really need season 1 to set things up. But season 2 is going to be a project of love for me because of the variety of games I can feature at that point. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392859/#Comment_392859" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-09T10:38:32+00:00" title="October  9, 2012 10:38AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you like Lady Blackbird, you might consider using that game, and just rephrasing a few elements.

I'm going to have to find a copy and try it with my gaming group.<br/><br/>To give you some insight, the first script we had was slimmed down because it was too rules heavy. We actually found The Gamers: Dorkness Rising after starting preproduction while looking for who had done something similar (The Guild for tabletop was our inspiration early on). Watching the opening scene where they argue of rules had us a bit cross-eyed and wanting to click off (watched on YouTube), and we're gamers who understood what they were talking about.<br/><br/>A rules-lite system (story system? not sure we want to get into that debate here <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>) is perfect to pare that arguing that we had - we had a similar level of it and started to cut a lot of the mechanics talk out. We do have our simulationist/rules lawyer character, and he absolutely pushes for a more rules heavy game, and the group does divide a bit on that point.<br/><br/>As I said above, season 2 is going to give a lot of leeway for what we can do with games. For season 1, we want to introduce non-gamers to the hobby and provide some entertainment for established hobbyists. I think The Gamers franchise hits the diehard gaming community pretty well. Our focus is to grow the community by reaching a different audience, people on the fence or who have never tried gaming before, but still have something for the diehard's to enjoy. Introducing rules-lite systems in season 1 would meet that goal, especially if they are games that are popular with diehard gamers, and opens up season 2 for games that are a little more complicated.<br/><br/>Our intention with the games we use is to also push marketing for them.

The script calls for a second group of LARPers who play a darker game (written with WoD Vampire in mind). Monsterhearts looks like it could be a lot of fun for that. And since you said it is based on the AW engine, it would be easy to learn the rules for the cast and viewers who choose to play both of games featured in the season. IMO, LARPing can be done with any rules system, so it doesn't exactly require Vampire, despite how well known that product is in the LARPing community.</blockquote>\nSo here's the thing.<br/><br/>Please, please, please learn about and experience larping before you try to portray it on screen. Please.<br/><br/>Larping cannot be done (well) with any just rules system. It is not just a matter of standing up while you do tabletop play. Really, it's not.<br/><br/>One of the biggest differences is this - the majority of good larp systems (Vampire being probably the biggest exception, though I hesitate to call the system good, just popular) do their best to remove chance/probability/dice as much as possible, and many remove it 100%.<br/><br/>Most games do not translate well from tabletop to larp because most tabletop games are written assuming the use of chance/probability/dice will drive much of the game and that doesn't work well in larp. Generally speaking, the worst larp systems are the ones that are conversions from tabletop.<br/><br/>Not understanding that results in on-screen portrayals that look more like Lloyd the Conqueror, which is a horrible portrayal of how larp works even though it's a funny movie, rather than Role Models or The Wild Hunt, which portray larp in a way that is far more accurate because they actually took the time to learn about it.<br/><br/>That being said, the idea of using Monsterhearts as a conversion larp instead of Vampire is great. Especially if you have a player cast that is not all guys, because Monsterhearts really plays up the sex and relationships a lot (which, granted, do not have to be straight. But if you were planning to make homosexuality a big part of your storyline, I think you'd have mentioned it by now. But I could be wrong.)<br/><br/>But one of the core driving mechanics in Monsterhearts is Strings. And in tabletop play, that's something driven by a die roll. I think for a larp version, you'd want to work out a completely different mechanic for that.<br/><br/>I'd be willing to work with you on that, outside of this thread, if you'd like. I love designing larp mechanics. Send me a PM if you're interested.<br/><br/>For the Monsterhearts characters having sex, there's a great larp technique called Ars Amandi that already exists and would look pretty awesome on screen. Basically it consists of players touching each others hands and arms and maybe shoulders while looking in each others eyes. I think it would film quite well.<br/><br/>Here's an into to it. <a href="http://lizziestark.com/2011/11/09/intro-to-ars-amandi/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://lizziestark.com/2011/11/09/intro-to-ars-amandi/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RyanDanks" title="RyanDanks"><img alt="RyanDanks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RyanDanks">RyanDanks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392904/#Comment_392904" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-09T13:56:11+00:00" title="October  9, 2012  1:56PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, RobMcDiarmid!<br/><br/>I'll probably take you up on that offer as, I'll admit, my LARP experience is limited to secondhand knowledge from a friend who did it 15 years ago!

VERY different from parlor LARPs.<br/><br/>I'd also try to find a parlor LARP that plays in public, not private--makes a BIG change in style and tone. Vampire LARP was inspired by playing in nightclubs and such, which made The Masquerade actually a big deal, thereby constraining power use so it didn't become "supers with fangs": a common degeneration of Vampire when the play location is private. It also made nightly feeding relevant, not hand-waved by a half hour of downtime or whatever: find someone to dance with and/or snog. AND it made expanding the Clans more realistic: you actively tried to recruit new players as you met folks at the club, and "turn" them when they agree that they want to play.<br/><br/>Anyhow... not saying you need to try it all--and you couldn't in a reasonable amount of time and cost (Nordic LARP and big-fest LARPs in Europe are significantly different from parlor and boffer LARPs in the States). But those general elements of play--active v no-touch; public v private--are pretty key to understanding the basics of the art form.<br/><br/>HTH;<br/>David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_393076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RyanDanks" title="RyanDanks"><img alt="RyanDanks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RyanDanks">RyanDanks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393076/#Comment_393076" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-10T19:12:25+00:00" title="October 10, 2012  7:12PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow! I've played Vampire since just a couple years after the first one came out 20 years ago. I never knew that about the nightclub thing. That gives me a whole new perception of it. I can totally see why they implemented certain things. I'm keen to play that now! lol<br/><br/>I had a friend who LARPed with the local Vampire crowd about 10-15 years ago. They went strong for a couple of years but has since died out. If I can find something local, I will. It actually sounds like great fun.<br/><br/>By the way, the idea of public v private is great for what we have in mind. I thought that one of the LARPers would want to "turn it off" and so would always be IC, even in public. Now that I know there is such a thing as a public LARP, that is what she can be doing. Sounds amazing.<br/><br/>Thanks for that information. It really connects some of the dots in the later episode outlines.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RyanDanks" title="RyanDanks"><img alt="RyanDanks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RyanDanks">RyanDanks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393146/#Comment_393146" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-11T13:57:12+00:00" title="October 11, 2012  1:57PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good news, guys.<br/><br/>I'm getting response from some of the developers we've approached. Still no word from Joe McDaldno, so I might have to vet something else for the horror game that will feature later in the season (although another producer is in talks with White Wolf right now, but that is not my first choice - I like independents).<br/><br/>Fortunately, the horror/LARP game doesn't feature until the season releases and isn't needed for the pilot, so we have time on that one.<br/><br/>Given that we're almost there - finalizing the pilot script, walking the sets and storyboarding this weekend - we are looking at a mid-November launch for the Kickstarter. I guess that means you'll see it in December, the way these things go. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>For those interested, I'll keep you updated as we progress. Maybe I should start a blog to follow the stages of production?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_393165">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393165/#Comment_393165" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-11T18:56:35+00:00" title="October 11, 2012  6:56PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joe is posting currently on Story Games (i.e. earlier today).

I officially give you permission. I'd be happy to hook you up with PDF copies of the game so that you can confirm that this is the game you'd like to go with. If you choose to have it be the thing, I can send you a kit in the mail: some copies of the game, its supplement, also some posters (since I have them and am not sure what to do with them).<br/><br/>My email is my last name, which is also my S-G handle, at gmail.
