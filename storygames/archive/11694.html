I know it would be for me! Graham and I had a great conversation last week that helped clarify/solidify stuff but I'm looking to talk a little more about some things.<br/><br/>My own list goes like this:<br/><br/>* Best uses for Pillars of Sanity. Okay...so I'm a little vague on the cause-and-effect of Pillars of Sanity. They appear to be an artifact of having Sanity in multiples of 3. When you're making a character, you define a Pillar for ever 3 Sanity you have. No problem. I got that. On the losing side, it looks like you LOSE those Pillars as well as your Sanity goes down, again every 3. There's some haziness in my mind (and possibly in the text) about whether losing sanity "costs" the charactera Pillar or whether the character's player can "crumble" a Pillar to...somehow defend the character from the sanity loss. I think it's all the same thing, just framed in two different ways. So on to my questions!<br/><br/>1) Is there a best way for the player to "use" a Pillar of Sanity? It looks like it's a roleplaying flag without any economy attached to it. That's totally fine! But I want to make sure I'm not missing anything.<br/><br/>2) Is there a best way for the GM to "use" a Pillar? My feeling is that the GM has a bit more leverage here, since attaching a Mythos revelation to a Pillar really juices up the Stability/Sanity hit. I assume that that's A Good Thing! :-D <br/><br/>2a) In a prewritten adventure, how does the GM frame up a Mythos revelation in terms of a character's Pillar? This was very hazy to me when I read through The Black Drop. Since it's in playtest I don't want to talk specifics but let me come up with a similar Revelation...<br/><br/>Actually I can't. Which brings me to my next bullet point.<br/><br/>* What comprises a Mythos Revelation, for the purposes of hitting Stability and Sanity? What's the moment in play where it's clear this is a) a revelation and b) related to the vast cosmic horror of The Mythos? I assume actually observing a Mythos entity certainly counts: OMG it's a big thing that warps the local spacetime! I got that. Are there others? There must be, right? I could use some examples. I'll revisit my <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232a&amp;Mode=like">#2a</a> question above when I have a firmer grasp on this.<br/><br/>* When is it cool to treat someone's Drive as a hard driver, and when is the GM just being a dick about it?<br/><br/>* Should the players be proactively looking for clues via their Investigation skills? What if they don't present the right skill, or even a related semi-correct skill? Isn't this sort of the same pixelbitching problem we had under "roll to find the clue" system? Or can the GM let the players flounder a bit before pointing them in the right direction? Like...I can totally imagine a scene where the investigator is trying to ... use forensics or some other direct-observation type effort, when in fact they really ought to be using a social skill like Reassurance or Intimidation to get the job done.<br/><br/>Let's go with that for now. Also, if a ToC veteran has some good Best Practices not related to stuff I've brought up here, PLEASE do post them.<br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260798/#Comment_260798" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-08T17:21:58+00:00" title="March  8, 2010  5:21PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 8, 2010 5:22PM by Graham.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Before getting to the specific stuff...<br/><br/>When indie gamers play Trail of Cthulhu, they have <i>completely</i> different issues than Call of Cthulhu gamers do. It's fascinating. Indie gamers look at the rules and go: these rules must drive the game! The clue mechanics must be the most important thing! And, because they start with the mechanics, they see Trail as a railroady system, in which players read down lists of abilities, while the Keeper doles out clues.<br/><br/>Contrastingly, Call of Cthulhu gamers understand that the clue mechanics aren't the main thing. What matters is the style of play. You explore in character, you interact, you talk to NPCs. The clue mechanics kick in when you investigate (and you're not doing that all the time). Call of Cthulhu players hate <i>completely</i> different things about Trail of Cthulhu (e.g. that you can't fail a skill roll).<br/><br/>So that's a good start. When you play, you're interacting in character <i>a lot</i>. You use Investigative Abilities occasionally, but you're not dealing with clues all the time. Most of the time, you just play your character.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260803/#Comment_260803" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-08T17:56:48+00:00" title="March  8, 2010  5:56PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 8, 2010 6:08PM by komradebob.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now you're just confusing me Graham!

It looks like it's a roleplaying flag without any economy attached to it.</blockquote>\nPretty much!\n<blockquote>2) Is there a best way for the GM to "use" a Pillar?</blockquote>\nPillars of Sanity are an oddity. They're a relatively minor feature, with lots of potential, but the rules don't give much guidance on realising that potential. Try this.<br/><br/>Attack it over the course of a campaign. If an Investigator has a particularly interesting Pilllar (e.g. "God bless the USA"), pitch some of the mystery so that it attacks that pillar (e.g. documents that suggest the US Army released a Mythos entity, believing they could control it).\n<blockquote>2a) In a prewritten adventure, how does the GM frame up a Mythos revelation in terms of a character's Pillar?</blockquote>\nIn a preprepared adventure: honestly, attacking Pillars of Sanity will probably be less of a thing. Concentrate on using them as roleplaying tools.<br/><br/>That said, Pillars of Sanity often run along the same lines. Pretty much, they are: my god is awesome; science is awesome; nature is awesome; my country is awesome. The Mythos attacks all of those: your god is irrelevant; your science is wrong; nature is malevolent; and your country is powerless against the Mythos. So a single Mythos revelation can attack many Pillars.\n<blockquote>What comprises a Mythos Revelation, for the purposes of hitting Stability and Sanity?</blockquote>\nDo you mean that table on page 76? That is <i>specifically</i> for using the Cthulhu Mythos ability. If you just find out something about the Mythos, you get a Stability roll, but you don't use that table.<br/><br/>Actually observing a Mythos entity is another thing. There's another table, on page 86, that deals with that. <br/><br/>Perhaps it's easier to talk about the ways you can lose Sanity. They're pretty limited. They are, I think:<br/><br/>* You make a Stability Roll, for a Mythos event, and it takes you below 0 Stability. <br/>* You make a Stability Roll, for a Mythos event, and it takes you below -5 Stability. <br/>* You use the Cthulhu Mythos ability.<br/>* You see a Mythos entity.<br/>* And I think using magic might do it, too.\n<blockquote>* When is it cool to treat someone's Drive as a hard driver, and when is the GM just being a dick about it?</blockquote>\nWe rarely use hard drivers. If you feel like you're being a dick, you're probably being a dick.\n<blockquote>Should the players be proactively looking for clues via their Investigation skills?</blockquote>\nYes. (This is the sort of thing that Call of Cthulhu players know instinctively).\n<blockquote>What if they don't present the right skill, or even a related semi-correct skill?</blockquote>\nWell...<br/><br/>The secret Rule Zero of GUMSHOE is: the clues get out. So they will have <i>some</i> skill that will reveal the clue. Even when, in a prescripted scenario, it says "This clue requires Reassurance", you'd actually give it to them if they used Intimidation.<br/><br/>Hope that's of some use.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260807">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260807/#Comment_260807" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-08T18:23:06+00:00" title="March  8, 2010  6:23PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham,<br/><br/>I really dig these GUMSHOE/Trail of Cthulhu threads.  The thing I don't really understand is WHY/WHEN I pause the clue hunt.  So I'm a player in a GUMSHOE game.  I know there's a mystery to be solved and a trail of clues that will lead me to the answer.  So, I start looking for clues.  I find one!  I figure out what it means.  Great!<br/><br/>Why do I not immediately move on to the next scene and start looking for clues?  What makes me linger?  What makes me go somewhere else?  What makes me not immediately start looking for clues upon my arrival elsewhere?<br/><br/>That's why Fear Itself was so intriguing.  In Fear Itself my character has a Goal and Worst Thing They Ever Did as well as Affinities/Emnities.  The Horror comes in and positions itself relative to those things.  So I might stop looking for clues to further position myself relative to that Horror.  It's a dance and the Matrix of Misery is the dance floor.  That's interesting.<br/><br/>I don't see why I would ever do that in Trail of Cthulhu.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260811/#Comment_260811" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-08T19:28:02+00:00" title="March  8, 2010  7:28PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just finished re-writing the <i>Trail of Cthulhu</i> adventure I've been working on in light of my experience running it twice at Dreamation as well as other playtester comments. I should say up front that the bulk of the re-writing was necessary to make the adventure creepier, rather than to fix procedural problems: the content, rather than the system.<br/><br/>I think Graham's point about indie gamers encountering this system is well-taken. It is a shock to encounter a game whose sub-systems are so loosely tied to its game-mechanical currency and rewards. Pillars of Sanity are a good example. Were this an indie game out of the Forge tradition, you would follow your Pillars to earn Stability and lose Stability when you eschewed your Pillars, like Keys or Aspects. ToC does this with Drives to some extent, but the rules suggest that the GM is supposed to code them into the adventure to propel investigators in the "right" direction, rather than as a device to motivate in-character action. Now I think there's an argument to be made that there is a reward cycle in which Pillars of Sanity are involved, but mainly as a sort of indicator of character ablation: You're so messed up now that you've seen all these things, you can no longer believe in human decency the way you used to. <i>Whoa. That's pretty messed up. I can play that guy.</i> It's like hit points: they measure a state outcome, the back end of the process of play. Knowing that you're down to half your hit points doesn't <i>require</i> you to act a particular way, but you'll tend to behave more conservatively than if you were at full health. Same sort of thing with Sanity, with Pillars as color.<br/><br/>But you really can't expect the system to do much for you at the <i>front</i> end, in the sense of helping to pace and structure interactions. You have to role-play it out, which means you have to have a strong sense of your NPCs, who they are, and what they want. It's also the case that you should regard what's written about which Interpersonal skill entices an NPC to reveal what information as hopeful suggestions rather than hard-and-fast prescriptions, so much so that I'd recommend writing up what NPCs know and are willing to reveal separately from how they'll react to different Interpersonal skill uses -- so you as Keeper know that (a) this NPC will reveal that he is afraid of NPC X, and (b) this NPC finds Flattery odious. So you can combine them such that when an investigator uses Flattery, you can have the NPC say something like, "Did X send you to get me lower my guard? Is that what this is? It won't work! Go away!"<br/><br/>Also, I think you have to be willing to step up and reconfigure the dice mechanic to make it do what you want it to do. The keep-rolling-until-you-fail system for contests works sometimes, but only sometimes. In other cases, you'll want to set a fixed number of rolls--I might say, "Roll three times to see if you get away." Or you'll want success or failure on an earlier die roll to influence the outcome of a subsequent one--"if you make this roll, your next roll is at -1 Difficulty. If you fail, it's at +1."<br/><br/>Additionally, I think it's worth it to push the notion of "player facing" as far as it will go, such that you as GM don't actually track NPC or creature pools at all. Have the players roll Athletics to avoid the monstrous pseudopod lashing out at them, or Fleeing to escape the pursuing shoggoth--but give the creature a Combat bonus or penalty or a Chase bonus or penalty as needed to reflect its ferocity or tenacity or whatever. In other words, treat the servitors game-mechanically the same way you treat the Old Ones and Outer Gods: as something atmospheric to be described rather than to be gamed.<br/><br/>As far as scene-pacing goes, one of the things I had to do in rewriting <b>Castle Bravo</b> was note explicit "scene" (actually situation) ending circumstances, marking when it was time to advance the action to the next set-piece set-up. "This scene ends when everyone has said everything they want to say." "This scene ends when the characters leave the affected area."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260814/#Comment_260814" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-08T19:54:57+00:00" title="March  8, 2010  7:54PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 8, 2010 7:57PM by PaulB.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The p76 chart is only for the Cthulhu Mythos skill use?

Like I told Graham, sometimes this stuff is easier to parse out and dissect in text (and sometimes all the hypotheticals take us down stupid definitional dead-ends, so let's not do that).<br/><br/>Graham: I get the example where your text or notes might say you need Reassurance but then you slap the NPC around and the GM says it's okay to turn it into an Interrogation clue. But what about the situation I mention above where the approach is totally perpendicular to the intended approach? Like Flattery and Reassurance and Intimidation are all go-talk-to-the-NPC skills, but the PC decides he'd rather just look at the scene (Forensics, History, Art, whatever) and not engage the NPC. Is it on the GM to push the NPC into their face? Gently nudge them into talking to the guy? Yes that's the very same hypothetical I just said I was scared of, and it might not even come up in Actual Play. Maybe that's a better question: Do players generally get what they're supposed to be doing in a scene?<br/><br/>On "attacking" the Pillars of Sanity: Sounds like that is entirely tied to Cthulhu Mythos skill, not the big reveal when you realize all your cousins and uncles are actually fish-folk. Or even when you directly observe a Mythos phenomenon/bigbad. I liked Bill's example that Pillars are like chunks of illustrated hit points -- I can work with that.<br/><br/>EDIT: And is it true that you only gain Cthulhu Mythos by reading scary books?

But sometimes there's no way that the skills they are using could get any of the possible optional clues, so it goes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260837/#Comment_260837" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-09T00:53:12+00:00" title="March  9, 2010 12:53AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I give out Cthulhu Mythos for sufficiently life changing encounters with Mythos entities for a couple of reasons. One is that players should have Cthulhu Mythos points to use. They're a great way of developing the character and furthering the plot and they come with a big price. The player has to really want to know and be prepared to pay. It's great drama.<br/><br/>The other is that they are to a certain extent a reward, even if you don't use them. They're a badge of honour for the character saying, I've seen this and I'm still here. I'm not like you normal people anymore. Even if players don't spend them, you can use the fact that they have them to notice unusual things such as the Innsmouth Look or intuit secret knowledge such as the way the stars are arranged on the Australian flag. Also, they character is going mad, and that's always a good thing. It's Ken Hite's the Man who Shot Joseph Curwen: to defeat the Mythos, you must use the Mythos and condemn yourself. The struggle to stay pure and human and sane is always great drama and the pillars are a way of externalising this internal conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260851/#Comment_260851" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-09T03:28:01+00:00" title="March  9, 2010  3:28AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll wait wait for a while until the thread has died down, then post my own take, including a proper Pillars of Sanity summary - I admit the Pillar rules are not as well organised as they might be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260890/#Comment_260890" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-09T07:06:48+00:00" title="March  9, 2010  7:06AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Suppose I'm running a Trail of Cthulhu game (or any Gumshoe, really) on extremely short notice.

On the subject of optional point spends for noncore clues: So if the GM has a couple hard-coded point spend opportunities in a scene, what's the best procedure for getting those doled out? I can envision two ways that might play out:<br/><br/>* The players start tossing out their skills in the hopes they bump into the right one. <i>Botany? Forensics? How about Reassurance?</i> Pro: player feels empowered and rewarded for having the right skill at the right time -- if they stumble upon the right skill at the right time. Con: feels forced, inorganic, not roleplaying; might miss really great (but non-core) information.<br/><br/>* The GM offers opportunities for specific spends in a scene: <i>If anyone has Botany, you can spend a point here.</i> Pro: Gets to the heart of the matter. Con: again feels forced and overmechanical.<br/><br/>Those both feel inadequate. So now I'm looking at the RAW and find some advice that I'd like to unpack a bit...<br/><br/>p52 has the following breakdown:<br/><br/>* Player can specify an intent, wider speculation, or general fishing, calling upon an investigative skill.<br/><br/>* Keeper can ask if you have a particular ability.<br/><br/>Which basically is what I came up with above. And then the punchline is: "If your suggested action corresponds to a clue in the scenario notes, the Keeper provides you with the information arising from the clue." Granted this refers to core clues but I assume the same applies to spends and benefits as well.<br/><br/>p54 gets into spends and benefits. It sounds like the training cycle for the players goes like this:<br/><br/>* Start by telling players explicitly about spend opportunities, describing skills + costs. Feels artificial but it's probably the best way to train 'em up.<br/><br/>* Eventually let the players proactively specify when they want to exert more time/effort (ie attempt to spend), either keying into what the GM has prepped or prompting the GM to grant a benefit (per the chart on p53). The former sounds again like a matter of luck, the latter sounds like a terrific improv-play tool (probably with room to be used in a prepped scenario if you're a smart GM who knows how to not break the scenario with any given spend).<br/><br/>Hm. I've typed a wall of text but I'm not sure what my question is. Maybe...how do you make the spend mechanic feel organic <i>and</i> ensure that non-core clues find their way to the players?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261051/#Comment_261051" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-09T17:26:55+00:00" title="March  9, 2010  5:26PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 9, 2010 5:27PM by Graham.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>* The players start tossing out their skills in the hopes they bump into the right one.

The Investigators have entered an old house and questioned the cultist who lives there. He has told them the Core Clue: where the sacrifices take place.<br/><br/>However, the house also has a library. So one of the Investigators says: can I use Library Use? And, of course, the Keeper has some background information within that library, with Library Use as the designated skill.<br/><br/>Or the house has some strange plants. So one of the Investigators says: can I use Botany? Or it has some strange rocks, so the Investigator says: can I use Geology?<br/><br/>In other words, the Investigators read the situation and use the most appropriate skills. So, a "totally perpendicular" line of inquiry is, I think, something of a red herring. If there's a big mysterious house, with a cultist waiting to be questioned, the Investigators will naturally use interpersonal skills to get the information. They won't, for example, start using Biology to examine the local animals. Why would they?<br/><br/>Now, what <i>might</i> happen is that they take a clever line of inquiry. For example, instead of questioning the cultist, they sneak into his house and use their Occult skill to find what he's up to. And, yes, then the Keeper has to make a call. Usually, I'd let them discover whatever they would have found by questioning him.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261052/#Comment_261052" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-09T17:34:29+00:00" title="March  9, 2010  5:34PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lenny, my minimal preparation is to scribble something like this on a napkin.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/sgG-VVUo60i7V3bMKndr53A_17.png"/><br/><br/>So that's the structure of the mystery, OK?

So to be clear clue-chain mystery scenarios were my GMing bread and butter for a long time.  So while I totally get that GUMSHOE solves the core problem of what happens if the players don't find what they need to move forward I don't see it addressing any of the other issues I ran into.  This is something I ran into quite frequently.<br/><br/>As the GM I say, "You come into the library, ornate tapestries hang from the wall depicting scenes from the life of Henry the V.  Each row of books is headed by an ornately carved statue.  The floor itself appears to be made of marble and is inscribed with odd occult runes.  The large domed ceiling sports an incredibly detailed map of the stars."<br/><br/>So one player uses Library Use and gets whatever Core Clue I put there in the books.  But then the players do this:<br/><br/>Player 1: I use History on the Tapestries.  Me: "Uh... yeah... scenes of Henry the V like I said."<br/>Player 2: What about Astrology on the ceiling.  Me: "Sure are some nice stars."<br/>Player 3: Oh!  Oh!  I want to use Art History on the statues.  Me: "Yes they're statues."<br/>Player 1: What about Ocult Lore on the runes on the floor.  Me: Yeah, they look a lot like the runes you saw before.<br/>Player 3: Hey wait before we go on we should look BEHIND the tapestries.<br/>Player 2: What if we push on the book shelves?<br/><br/>Me: Sigh.<br/><br/>In other words, every little bit of atmospheric color I introduce prompts some kind of "investigate" action resulting in a lot of wasted player actions that achieve nothing and in no way move the story forward.<br/><br/>Jesse<br/><br/>P.S. The net result was that I stopped describing things.  I would just say, "It's a library, there are books."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261076/#Comment_261076" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-09T20:08:43+00:00" title="March  9, 2010  8:08PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>Scribbled structure, visual images, NPCs, and I'm ready to go.</blockquote>\nSee, that's interesting to me, because my instinct would be to start with the solution to the mystery itself and work backwards. <br/><br/>So I'd have to go, "Well, I know I want X horror, and I want Deep Ones.

Let's say those Deep Ones slaughtered some miners down by the quarry. Let's say they're just finding out about missing miners in town."

I do something similar so. Here's an example.<br/><br/>Whenever I go to a convention, I like to run a game set in that place. I went to a convention in Paris last year, in Montreuil so I looked around for interesting things about Montreuil and found Les murs a peches, a massive stand of walls built to shelter peach trees from cold weather and laid out in a labyrinth. To me that suggested brains and also Y'golonac because he lives in a labyrinth. So then I had to find a way of making this some kind of challenge. Typically Y'golonac possess people so it seemed natural for that to happen to the PCs and there be some race to rid themselves of his presence. All good so far.<br/><br/>Next I decided to investigate the Left Bank intellectual set of the 30s to see if there was anything apposite and I found out that Georges Bataille started a secret society called Acephalous whose symbol is a headless man, the same as Y'golonac. So I collected losts of pictures of headless people, a bit of Parisian background on Shakespeare and Co, an American bookshop, the catacombs, another labyrinth and potential red herring, some locations for scenes. In the first run of the game, I loaded these clues onto the players to see what they'd do with them and we had a scenario. I've run it four times now and each time I've refined the clue trail so that now everything feels very natural. I've also found that whilst the outcome is pretty much the same each time, players go about things in very different ways.<br/><br/>The other thing with point spending is that you always get something useful and that if you have some points, you get some basic information without spending. This might change how you introduce things. As a player facing game, it's usual to draw attention to those things that each character might notice, so you might mention to the player with history that the tapestries are unremarkable, in other words, there's no spend here. The player can force a spend for a benefit but that's not a clue and mostly it's up to the player to say what they get. So if the historian wants, he can spend a point to notice that the tapestry is actually a rare design, worth rather more than at first he thought. He can use this point of history to get say a 2pt credit rating, or some other interpersonal skill, bargaining or flattery, with the owner of the tapestry.<br/><br/>The other thing is that it's not D&amp;D. Trail (and Call) of Cthulhu are very character centred, you don't expect a dungeon and your characters tend to react in more naturalistic ways. Certainly those with particular interests will look at those, but it's unusual in my experience, and almost game breaking, for the group to behave like the murderous robbers you get in D&amp;D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261185/#Comment_261185" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T09:38:50+00:00" title="March 10, 2010  9:38AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay new question, not strictly a "best practice" issue but rather a rules confusion.<br/><br/>We had a chase scene last night in our Black Drop playtest: armed cultist gets worked over by the PCs and runs away and the PCs give chase! I guess at this being a Fleeing roll for the NPC and an Athletics roll for a PC (they declined to piggyback on one roller, just sending one dude after the NPC).

If you fail the roll on your turn, you lose the contest.<br/><br/>This is what the rules say:<br/><br/>In a contest, each participant acts in turn. The first to fail a roll of the contested ability loses. The Keeper decides who acts first. In a chase, the character who bolts from the scene acts first. Where the contestants seem to be acting at the same time, the one with the lowest rating in the relevant ability acts first. In the event of a tie, NPCs act before Investigators. In the event of a tie between Investigators, the player who arrived last for the current session goes first in the contest.<br/><br/><b>Pillars of Sanity</b><br/>Pillars of Sanity like the Sanity ability itself are a tool for long term campaign play. They are damaged by long-term exposure to the truths of the mythos. In short games, characters are less to have Pillars of Sanity destroyed or "crumble from within" and there be a system effect.  They are always good roleplaying hooks for for players, in any event.<br/><br/>Graham has covered most of the systemic ways Pillars can be attacked, but the important thing to note - the only system effect of losing all of your pillars of sanity, is that all Stability Difficulty rolls increase by one. Your mind will not survive much longer. Stability (at least in non-Purist games) can recovered, while Sanity rarely can - it's the long slow decline of your character's mental health as they realist the truth of the Mythos.<br/><br/>Practically, here is a way you could use Pillars in a campaign:<br/><br/>Before you start, pick one or two spotlight characters, if two, people with similar pillars.<br/><br/>Think of scenes, or at least colour elements which can be introduced into scenes, which challenge or attack the pillar(s).<br/><br/>Write down each element - a sentence or two at the most will do it.<br/><br/>The non-mythos revelations can chip away at "the innate goodness of mankind" - for example, seeing a bunch of kids torturing a dog, then finding a collection of newspaper reports detailing many nasty and pointless crimes while you are looking for other evidence. <br/><br/>Think of a mythos potential mythos revelation which attacks the pillar. Preferably, but not essentially, make this a Mythos clue which will really help the party move forward in the mystery. This gives them a choice. Do they open the book knowing that it might affect their entire view of the world, and crush their pillar? Do the colour scenes meant they allow their pillar to crumble? <br/><br/>The mythos revelation does the rest of the work, as people quite happily perform most repellent and inhuman deeds just because they've seen a picture, watched a play or heard a tone from a sonic oscillator. It has to be the mythos in the end which crushes the pillar.<br/><br/>Attacking pillars is optional in the sense that you don't have to do it as a Keeper, but it's not strictly an optional rule. <br/><br/><b>Prepped vs non-prepped games</b><br/><br/>Running a prepped game, I think, is the issue for you (Paul), rather than GUMSHOE. Running "perpendicular lines of enquiry" is all fine and good, and I bet the players can't tell the difference in the main. Leading them back on track (if you want to do this) is not hard - just find a natural linking clue which takes them back to where they should be, or let events overtake them so that they have to react.<br/><br/><b>Example Low-Prep Game</b><br/><br/>For a minimal prep game, I use a potted version of the suggestions in the book, that is, work backwards from the Horrible Truth to the Hook. I'll do this now on the fly.<br/><br/>Horrible Truth<br/>Professor Legato is a puppet controlled by Mi-Go. He is performing sinister experiments on volunteers whom he pays. The Mi-Go are using the data. We'll set it in Cambridge 1931, and I'll make him a Physics Professor.<br/><br/>I google for Cambridge and print out a couple of pages of colour. I google "Cambridge 1930s physics" and get "The discovery of the neutron in 1932 by James Chadwick, a physicist at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, allowed physicists to theorize that the nucleus was composed of protons and neutrons." So, Legato is a colleague of Chadwick. Check out Chadwick.<br/><br/>Legato has installed a device which allows people to conceive the true nature of the atom, a revelation of crushing power which shows them their true insignificance.<br/><br/>Trail of Clues<br/>The volunteers go on to perform horrible crimes, commit suicide or just behave strangely.<br/>They were all in debt and without many friends; some were mental patients.<br/><br/>[I don't worry too much about the abilities - I just think of clues]<br/>Newspaper reports<br/>Peter Higley in police custody, and crime reports<br/>Recent patients at the local hospital mental health ward.<br/>PCs find out their connections to the lab, through perhaps a newspaper clipping (an advert) found in their digs.<br/>The newspaper has details of who placed the ad, and all those people who responded.<br/><br/>These clues will tend to be free floating - so I can place them in scenes where it is appropriate.<br/><br/>Antagonist Reactions<br/>At least one of them, say Horrace Limnal, a street lighter, is dangerous. He has locked himself in his house. He has painted all the windows black and constructed a model of what he saw out of everything he found in his room. He hides in the cupboard and attacks them when they come in, screaming about the terrible light.<br/><br/>If it's needed, have a Mi-Go puppet watching Limnal's apartment notice them and trail them, eventually attempting to confront them in a very non-human fashion (think that android in Alien trying to kill someone with a tube of paper)<br/><br/>Hook<br/>Always the personal element. Look at the PCs. Make them all friends/colleagues and have one of their friends/offsping of a friend be one of the affected. How about a student goes on a mad rampage during a party - one of the volunteers.<br/><br/>That's about enough for a session. I'd look at all the character sheets and tick off the clues, and try to incoporate their abilities - eg Astronomy? A weird meteor shower five weeks ago signalling the arrival of the Mi-Go. Be ready to dole out interesting special benefits, too. In Cambridge there will be tons of academics who will offer help, for example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261600/#Comment_261600" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-12T07:39:01+00:00" title="March 12, 2010  7:39AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2010 7:39AM by Graham.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lenny, yes, I'd start with the mystery.

Each row of books is headed by an ornately carved statue. The floor itself appears to be made of marble and is inscribed with odd occult runes. The large domed ceiling sports an incredibly detailed map of the stars."</blockquote>\nJesse, fuck, yes, I'd investigate that stuff too! It sounds really interesting. And, if you're being that specific, those runes and stars <i>must</i> be significant.<br/><br/>It's an interesting issue. I think it's a problem with describing things, rather than Gumshoe. For comparison, here are some detailed descriptions from The Watchers In The Sky, which is AVAILABLE SOON:\n<blockquote>On entering, the Investigators will be directed to the Geriatric Ward, in the East Wing of the hospital. As they navigate the corridors, which smell strongly of antiseptic and faintly of urine, it becomes gradually clear that this is a home for the mad. Screams and moans penetrate the doors as they pass. Indeed, this is the new home of Bedlam, the notorious London asylum in which, for centuries, lunatics and moral bankrupts were incarcerated. Although the site has changed, the ghosts of the old building seem to have followed to the new.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>In the basement of the Temple Building, one of the more hideously Gothic of the University buildings, is the Dissection Theatre. It is pentagonal, five tiers of narrow wooden seating surrounding a central dissection table. It is also dim, the light from the filthy stained glass windows barely illuminating the dark and stained wood. When not packed with students, it is also a useful dissection room, if one does not mind the jars of pickled organs, animal, human and unidentifiable, that line the walls. </blockquote>\nNobody ever investigates the screams, smell of urine, shape of the theatre or stained glass windows. Sometimes they look at the pickled organs, so I tell them they're just pickled animal organs.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261607/#Comment_261607" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-12T07:58:32+00:00" title="March 12, 2010  7:58AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2010 10:39AM by Simon_Rogers.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>* Should the players be proactively looking for clues via their Investigation skills?

Or can the GM let the players flounder a bit before pointing them in the right direction? Like...I can totally imagine a scene where the investigator is trying to ... use forensics or some other direct-observation type effort, when in fact they really ought to be using a social skill like Reassurance or Intimidation to get the job done.</blockquote>\nThis is not a system question as such, and I think it's very easy to worry about this. Always be giving out clues. Unless they really love it, be free with information, encourage them to spend every point of investigative ability every chance they get. Yes, definitely let them use other skills to get the same informationt. Core clue is about moving them on, not absolutely specifying how they have to do. They aren't going to do this if they know when it's time to move on, so let them know when a scene is ended. Let the mechanic then fade into the background.<br/><br/>How clues get from GM to player depends on the circumstances, but here are some examples:<br/><br/>Really super obvious things. You flag them up to the person with the right skill then give them a little extra infor when they've examined this and possibly roleplayed a little.<br/>A big painting. You could say "Bob [guy with the highest Art History skill], this looks Escher sketch"  "Anyone with Art History can see that it's Escher..."  "on close examination, you see it's on 14th century paper. " Player has the chance to say something or do something about this.<br/><br/>An improvised clue might be, player says, "Was it recently framed"?<br/>"Yes - and the details of the framer are on the back"<br/><br/>A simple search gets them all the obvious stuff on a scene, which they can then start examining with their abilities. It's usually obvious which abilities match or nearly match, so that eliminates skill listing.<br/><br/>I've got to say, I've never seen this skill listing in actual play, although one playtest group mentioned it - but it came across as a kind of passive-agressive "we want to play a game where you roll" thing.<br/><br/>If the players enjoy the work, let the clues not be enough to get them to a new scene - let them do some brain work, then pay points to solve a problem if they can't otherwise get it.<br/><br/>A lot of this is described in the clue-getting rules and in articles on Page XX.<br/><br/>Let me know if this helps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261629/#Comment_261629" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-12T09:09:26+00:00" title="March 12, 2010  9:09AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good stuff Simon, thank you.

It's best that at least one player is taking notes of active leads; in a standard GUMSHOE game, players should either be following or finding active leads.
