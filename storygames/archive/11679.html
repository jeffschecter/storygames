We were both conscious of the borrowing, and it helped to shape our decisions, what we said, and how we reacted to each other within the fiction, especially given the fast pace of the Jeepform medium. It does feel a bit odd to secretly borrow someone else's skin and wear it around for a while, and I'd be uncomfortable if our unwitting models ever found out. They're both people we genuinely like and consider to be friends, so it makes me wonder a bit about us given that the characters ended up pigheaded, stubborn, self-righteous, and-- eventually-- victims/perpetrators of domestic abuse and a murder-suicide. Granted, that was the point of the scenario, but it still reinforces the fact that I'd never be able to share the experience with the people the characters were based on. Even if it hadn't ended badly, I still feel that it is a certain kind of invasion to base a character on someone you know; rendering someone into a fictional character is an odd crime, to be sure, but it definitely has a tinge of the criminal about it. That said, it's a great way to lend realism and authenticity to the characters and the story, so maybe it's OK in the service of the greater good? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Also, I'm pretty sure Ignotus and I once named our D&amp;D characters after two girls of our acquaintance from college: his was a sneak-thief, mine a swashbuckling prostitute.

It was kind of perfect. He had been working in his field for his whole life and was laid off. Rather than get a low paying job or sitting on his duff all day he answered an ad looking for technically-proficient people. He's not crazy about having to dispose of ghosts and monsters and approaches his job as a problem to be solved rather than as a potentially dangerous profession. Best of all, he was the oldest member on the team by a good twenty-something years so he'd go into "grumpy old man" mode.

Usually transitioned or blown out of proportion, the logic of their actions taken to an extreme form. <br/><br/>Most often I do this with folks I know, but am not terribly close to. When I do it with folks I'm close to I've found it doesn't help me make the model as well, as there's a bigger tangle between how the person acts and how I feel about how the person acts. Which can be rich ground to explore, but often moves more towards the "couples therapy" area than "creating fun drama" area.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone" title="Quintin Stone"><img alt="Quintin Stone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://rps.net/QS/Images/pipboy-32x32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone">Quintin Stone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260725/#Comment_260725" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-08T12:10:32+00:00" title="March  8, 2010 12:10PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 8, 2010 12:11PM by Quintin Stone.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was once ran a Unisystem game where the players did not know what the game would entail.
