In Jared's critiques at the end of the contest he said, "An investigation game?  Really?"  A while later, I met him at Dreamation or Dexcon and asked him what he meant by that.<br/><br/>He said, "<i>Every</i> game's an investigation game."<br/><br/>I replied, "Yeah, but they're not <i>real, good</i> investigation games."<br/><br/>Not much to work with there.  But now I think I have a better way to put it.  In the player's search for the GM's facts that will move the story forward, there are two basic play styles that show up.  <br/><br/><b>Style #1:</b><br/>The players should actually do what an investigator does.  Look at this, then look at that, then refine what they're looking for and look some more, until they're satisfied that they're fully equipped to move on.  At the extreme of this style, a GM might do what I did in middle school: put the clue on the ceiling, and feed the players an increasingly frustrating stream of "no luck" until one of them finally says, "Where haven't we looked?!  Anywhere?!  What about the fucking ceiling?!"  The GM is not actually <i>trying</i> to be a dick (or at least I wasn't).  He's trying to support the group agenda of "cleverness pays".  The players are going along with it because <i>sometimes</i> they decide to check the bottom of the beet jar, and that's where the clue is, and they get to high-five over their accomplishment.<br/><br/>Another facet or version of this play style is non-obvious clues.  "Well, we found the key, and we found the map.  What do we do now?"  The GM tries to feed the players a reasoning challenge they can overcome.  Sometimes it works.  "The key number is 705.  There are no 7-floor buildings on the map, but there is a post-office.  Let's check the P.O. boxes."  Sometimes it doesn't work.  "Uh... I guess we enter from the North and start checking everything on the map as we move south?  I know the apocalypse has nearly arrived, but we're out of ideas!"<br/><br/>Whether it be in an "investigation game" like Call of Cthulhu or a "game with investigation" like D&amp;D2, a lot of new GMs and players leap at Style <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, because the challenge is familiar from puzzle games.  Unfortunately, this process doesn't lend itself toward a satisfying narrative experience.  If you're actually playing because you like <i>role-playing</i>, it's hard to get consistent satisfaction.<br/><br/><b>Style #2:</b><br/>The other major style of investigative play takes the player effort and challenge out of the process.  You <i>will</i> find something that will productively move you along through the unfolding plot.  Maybe the GM will make you search briefly, but he's looking for any opportunity to hand you success.  The group may eventually say, "Okay, the characters search the place very thoroughly.  What do they find?"<br/><br/>Sometimes this is a functional part of a functional game.  Other times, it leaves players who liked being clever feeling superfluous, and GMs who manage all the discovery feeling unappreciated.  This play style is particularly doomed to failure when folks haven't made a conscious decision to <i>not</i> do style <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>.<br/><br/>When done right, I think the "investigation" in style <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> is most about telling stories that resemble investigative fiction -- in any way <i>except</i> the part where the protagonist brilliantly solves things.  Which is fine, because you still have all the other fun stuff from that genre.<br/><br/>I'm thinking of this now after re-re-reading Trail of Cthulhu.  The book says, quite clearly, "This is not style <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>.  This is NOT style <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>."  It even goes on to say, "You can enjoy the fun of our style <i>because</i> this isn't style <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>!"  The problem is that, at that point in the text, "our style" is still described by talking about how players get to "investigate".  "Investigation" is slapped all over the back cover too.  So, the first time I played, the GM and I were both in this weird halfway place, where we knew what was bad about style <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> and were going to avoid it, but hadn't replaced it with a new M.O., because, to us, "investigation" <i>was</i> style <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>.  Despite knowing rules like "announce an ability use and receive a relevant clue", I approached play as if I, y'know, needed to cleverly find stuff and figure things out.  I didn't realize that, instead of focusing on finding the trail, I should have just followed it easily and directed my energy to the sights and sounds along the way.<br/><br/>Anyway, to wrap up, I think there's no shortage of games that produce investigation-flavored fiction, and wherein the characters do plenty of investigating.  Style <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> works.  However, I've yet to see a play procedure set that adequately supports Style <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>.  I'm working on it, though.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255370/#Comment_255370" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-07T05:58:26+00:00" title="February  7, 2010  5:58AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>Anyway, to wrap up, I think there's no shortage of games that produce investigation-flavored fiction, and wherein the characters do plenty of investigating.

Knowing where to look for clues is a problem, both on the investigator's side and the gamemaster's side. Perhaps style <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> could be refined by exploring how the gamemaster can communicate to the players where to look, rather than what is revealed there?<br/><br/>My job involves training people to sort books, a task involving deductive reasoning. Unfortunately, a lot of people really have little ability to engage in deductive reasoning, and so any game that does a good job of encouraging and supporting it might hold clues that could improve training methods.<br/><br/>Things I've learned about how people fail to use deductive reasoning:<br/>- the most common failure is, "if at first you don't succeed, give up."<br/>- the second most common failure is, "if at first you don't succeed, ask someone else for the answer."<br/>- I also have to help people who are struggling with learning disabilities that make it difficult to interpret clues (e.g. a book spine labeled "romantic suspense" may seem clear, especially since we have a shelf for "romantic suspense", but a reading disability makes even such obvious clues difficult to use for some people)<br/><br/>My approach to overcoming some of these problems is really a matter of teaching people where to look for clues. Is the genre marked on the spine? Is the publisher known for producing a certain genre? Does the cover flap or back cover tell you anything about the book? I also teach what false clues to be cautious in over-using, such as the cover's aesthetic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255378/#Comment_255378" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-07T09:06:08+00:00" title="February  7, 2010  9:06AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 7, 2010 9:07AM by Graham.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How about considering pieces of information, rather than clues?<br/><br/>For example, the piece of information the players are trying to discover is: who is the murderer?

I understand that most people will think of Style 1 when they think of investigations, but in my limited experience, there's <i>always</i> a little bit of <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> mixed in.  Likewise, I've run games where I've gone with the <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> Style (without consciously acknowledging it) and there's been a little of <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> mixed in.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think, embracing the labels for a minute, that it would be <i>extremely</i> difficult and problematic to implement Style <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> without some intense GM planning.  As the GM, I'd have to lay out, in detail, every scene where a clue was hidden.  I'd have to map out useless items, items with obvious, but misleading clues and items with the truly case-breaking clues.  That's a lot more work than I want, or can, put into a game.  It's also difficult, because my GMing style is very freeform.  I often don't know who the bad-guy is or what he's done at the beginning of the game, and it comes out during play through character actions and development of the story.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, if someone <i>were</i> to implement Style <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> the way I've just said, that could be a pretty kickin' game.<br/>\n<br/>\nDevon                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255390/#Comment_255390" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-07T10:19:22+00:00" title="February  7, 2010 10:19AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I use a version of <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>. Only I have a lot of clues strewn about that if pursued, will give the players a general idea of what's going on. In the off chance that they don't, play will go on because there's a kind of deadline to the situation. Example:<br><br>My last Dark Days game. The characters are invited to a school reunion, only they have no recollection of every going to that school or ever living in that particular town. Slowly, they regain memories of the place and their classmaters. They arrive at the town and get more flashbacks (these are ''clues'' handed over, but they're mostly flavor) and eventually meet people they're supposed to know. The reunion is in 3 days and they suspect something sinister is at play. <br>If I dissect the story, these are the clues ''provided''.<br><br><b>Locations </b>triggering flashbacks. If they investigate some particular areas (they're not specific, one of the players asked about there being a lake and then a beach, he found the beach) they are rewarded with memories of flashbacks that pad the plot.<br><br/>The <b>people </b>in the town. It's obvious everyone in this town is either old (50+) or young-ish (30 or below). This doesn't add up. Furthermore, everyone above the age of 50 doesn't speak English. Following any of them or breaking into a house will uncover clues that will make the plot more obvious.<br/><br/>The core <b>NPCs</b>. Through discussion or investigation into their homes you can get some major information. <br/><br/><b>Traditional research</b>. Checking out the library or the town records should uncover some weird information that can help out with the mystery.<br/><br/>Now in case none of this works (in my game my players investigated the core NPCs, did traditional research and investigated a few locations), the reunion will take place in 3 days, at which point things will be revealed.<br/>I also always make sure my players know that no action is not allowed. No action will ''break'' the game or my enjoyment of it. I think it's important because players will often hold back on actions for fear they're doing unrealistic things (breaking and entering, intimidating someone, stealing, etc).<br/><br/><br/>I find investigation games easy to run. I wasn't impressed with the Call of Cthulhu (at least my understanding) kind of investigating (library research, diaries  and notes, that kind of thing) but I realized the important thing is, to just use logic when creating the story and the clues will fall into place.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255392/#Comment_255392" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-07T10:20:15+00:00" title="February  7, 2010 10:20AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This breakdown is artificial.  I was talking to John about this when we went drinking on Friday.<br/><br/>You don't need to create a mystery in order to GM an investigative RPG.  You just need to create characters who have done something that they're trying to hide or get away with, have some PCs whose best interests involve getting that information or finding out about the deed, and then turn them all loose on each other. <br/><br/>This is what happens in Dogs in the Vineyard for example, which is effectively a cop game mixed with a Western.  You come into the village, people tell you what's wrong and you investigate it and try to make it right. Meanwhile, you -- as GM -- don't have to either 1) feed clues to the players, like you're told to do in the GM advice in some investigative games, or 2) be especially secretive and make the players find stuff out.  You "just play your NPCs" (as both John and Vincent like to say) and you push back against the players' investigation with your NPCs, not with some weird de-characterized GM manipulation or something.<br/><br/>Honestly, I expect that Jared means something like that when he said "all games are investigative games."  This kind of thing is, honestly, no different than what you do as GM in many, many other games.  You just set up a premise and starting situation that pushes characters towards each other in an investigative fashion.  <br/><br/>Anything else, and in my opinion, the investigation feels really artificial.  The NPCs become only the means by which characters gain information related to the investigation and the GM is often tempted into teleological framing where the outcome of the investigation is pre-determined, even if the order in which PCs acquire information can change.  There's some right result that the PCs are driving towards finding. "The truth is out there," to quote the X-Files. However, in reality, there's no one truth out there.  In an investigative game, it should be totally possible that the PCs come to the wrong decision, shoot innocent people, lock up the wrong guy, follow false leads, get caught up in red herrings, all that stuff.  The situation should be complex, real, and changing, not some step-by-step deal.  And I think the best way to do that is to "just play your NPCs."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255394/#Comment_255394" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-07T10:24:44+00:00" title="February  7, 2010 10:24AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 7, 2010 10:25AM by George_Cotronis.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You just said what I was trying to say a million times better than I could.

The problem with games of the first type is that they're too "gamist," to borrow an overused expression - the solving of the mystery is treated as though it were a sort of linear, cumulative process like "levelling" in D&amp;D. Whereas the second types of games always strike players as being "on rails."<br/><br/>I've come to the conclusion that games based on the traditional model of mystery fiction simply aren't doable. If the GM starts out with the thought "The players' goal in this  session is to discover that X  did Y to Z," he will just always run into one or the other of the two aforementioned problems.<br/><br/>A better approach for GMs is to be much more flexible about the <i>significance</i> of a particular mystery that the players will be trying to solve to the overall narrative.

But to describe playing that game as "investigating" is risky, in my opinion.  Some people would get the right idea, and others wouldn't.  Personally, I'd describe play as "a series of ethical decisions", and then maybe state that "you're faced with those as you poke around a new place where something's amiss".  Your brain certainly doesn't do any puzzle-solving work when you play.  Contrast that to my "P.O. box" example from the opening post.<br/><br/><b>Lordgoon,</b><br/>I dig those techniques.  GM flexibility and back-up plans can avoid some lame play.  <br/><br/>"Too gamist" is tricky, isn't it?  You could have a game that is overtly gamist, with most of play spent on solving puzzles, and some "investigation" color thrown over it.  Or you could have a game with a different agenda, where the challenging puzzles ate up very small portions of play but fit into the whole in a satisfying way.  Either one could be a cool game, if you knew which was which.  I'm tempted to think the former is easier, but maybe I'm biased by my preference for the latter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255577/#Comment_255577" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-08T16:31:23+00:00" title="February  8, 2010  4:31PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 8, 2010 4:32PM by David_Berg.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My <b>hint-dropping</b> process goes like this:\n<blockquote>Mentally identify what I'd like the players to figure out next.

Then I'd "linearize" the revelation of that back-story by creating clues that would point to specific places/people with pre-scripted "trigger events" that happened upon arriving at those places.  If I was on the ball these would be branching events such that players would get clues at point to A, B and C and didn't matter what order they did A, B and C but they were all independent.<br/><br/>The goal of this is to slowly build up to the "big reveal" to deliver to the players a specific moment of, "Oh no!"

The puzzle was the "game" the players were playing the reward for "winning" was that I would deliver a cool bit of horror fiction of my authoring to them.  This made "losing" unsatisfying for both sides.  If the players couldn't solve the puzzle then they were frustrated and additionally I didn't get to tell my story so I was frustrated.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>If the latter, do you have any takeaways about what separated the successes from the failures?</blockquote>\nActually, the more static the game world was the more likely the game would work.  More specifically the more over and done with the back story was and the fewer actually present and still active NPCs there were the more likely it would work.  When the game was, what the hell happened here and how do we clean up the supernatural fallout from it, then it was fine.<br/><br/>It would be like showing up after the contents of Pickman's Model and once you figured out he was painting from real life all you had to do was shoot the horror that had eaten him.  Pickman is the real protagonist of the story and it's over and done with.  Now your job is to make sure it doesn't happen to anyone else.<br/><br/>The failures almost always relied on a present and active NPCs still trying to accomplish something while the PCs were active in the same area.  Inevitably the PCs would catch on too soon or work really hard to have a suspicious NPC followed.  It became impossible to guarantee the NPC(s) would be coordinated and pull of the specific events I needed them to for the "trick" of the story to work.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>IDid the Chill text help at all?  (I've never played that game.)</blockquote>\nYes actually.  Chill is a fairly functional game if you buy into how it works.  The hardest part is that it results in a lot of wasted effort on the part of the GM.  You're supposed to define several levels of Success for clue gathering.  So you need to play a lot of excess stuff that you may or may not ever get to use.  It's the same issue I have with spending points in Trail of Cthulhu you go through this effort to carefully lay out Core clues and bonuses for spending points.... but if no one spends the points they don't see your effort.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255626">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255626/#Comment_255626" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-08T20:04:08+00:00" title="February  8, 2010  8:04PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite><b>Madunkieg,</b><br/><br/><b>Northerain,</b><br/>So, throw in a gift reveal to get the players back on track if they failed to solve your initial puzzles?

Non-core clues do not have to be leads. They can be puzzles to be solved. For example, a point spend in a library might get you book, but there can be an actual problem to be solved in the book. What you won't do is go into the library and not find the book if you look for it. It's a very strange idea that there's "cleverness" in succeeding on a die roll.<br/><br/>The core clues will only take you to the final scene, not necessarily solve the mystery (if it's there to be solved). Certainly, you won't have ever to do that rather dull thing where you have to give a shopping list of places to search. The other vital, vital point is that Trail ensures you get the core clue, but any other clever way of getting it is also fine.<br/><br/>So, you can fine tune the level of investigative work to the needs of your adventure. If you want an adventure where you breeze through the mystery, where it's background to a narrative of increasing horror and dread you can do that (The Dying of St Margaret's is one such example), if you prefer just to make the core clues direct leads in themselves, and make the other clues an actual investigative problem for the players, you can.<br/><br/>The breadctrumb trail idea is often scorned, but it's actually quite sandboxy and open; you think of an event, and work backwards away from it considering what traces might be left. Of course, you can improvise evidence, and incorporate player suggestions.<br/><br/>Finally, a new book The Armitage Files uses GUMSHOE and a bunch of peculiar handwritten to notes for the GM and players to improvise an adventure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255725/#Comment_255725" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-09T08:54:04+00:00" title="February  9, 2010  8:54AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure I get what you're saying, David? What is required for puzzle solving? That there be only one correct answer? Because I think that's kinda crap and would refuse to play a game where that was the case.<br/><br/>The style I'm suggesting is neither <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> or <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>.  I've played both.  I just think they're both crap.  The GM should be neither trying to, <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, keep information from the players or, <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, use every opportunity to feed information to the players.  That basically means that the GM has all the power in the investigative process, not the players. The GM should basically try to remain agnostic about whether the players get the information or not.  It's the CHARACTERS, especially the NPCs, that have strong feelings about the players finding the information (among other things) and the GM should focus on figuring out what those characters would do to stop them and have that happen in the fiction. If this doesn't happen and the GM manipulates the NPCs so that they give away information or withhold information in ways that are inconsistent with what we know about those characters, it makes a game where the NPCs are simply puppets of the GM whims and not independent characters with their own agendas.<br/><br/>In this kind of investigation game, the investigation isn't a known fact.  We don't know how the investigation will occur!  We can't!  The GM literally has no idea how the PCs will go about investigating the problem, so you can't have predetermined scenes in mind where some NPC shows up and you have X interaction.  The PCs may never meet that NPC.  Instead, the players say what they're going to do and you build scenes around that, at the same time having the NPCs pursuing their own agendas in the background, reacting to PC behaviors but not standing around doing nothing until the PCs show up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255729/#Comment_255729" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-09T09:11:16+00:00" title="February  9, 2010  9:11AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            With some clever manipulation you can make the ending infodump into a nice setpiece instead of having a character tell them everything. <br/><br/>I can't really think of a system that helps in that particular way. What I'm using is basically an altered version of the Unknown Armies GM advice for creating stories. For Dark Days (the game I'm making), it goes something like this.<br/>One or more parties have a goal they want to achieve (power, knowledge, money, assets, whatever).<br/>To do this, they use a magic ''ritual'', only in this game magic rituals are essentially terrible things (human sacrifice, torture, whatever).<br/>The characters get involved either by one of the above parties (used as pawns) or by one of the victims or because of their own agenda.<br/><br/>I didn't want to spoil the story I was talking about before, because I'm going to post an AP, but what the hell, here's an example of that set up.<br/><br/>Sometime in the 60s, a secret organization that is a leftover of the Thule society is trying to create super soldiers. They pick a small city in Maine for their experiments. By posing as the US military, they pay the dying city a generous sum in order to set up a temporary base and run experiments on the town's children. <br/><i>Here we have the instigator and the goal they're trying to achieve.</i><br/><br/>They have in their hands a formula that makes people stronger, faster and more resilient. They put it in canned food which they donate to the town. From then on, they make sure the children eat the canned food and they monitor the results. The characters are two of those kids.<br/><i>Here we got the ''ritual''.</i><br/><br/>The characters, in their 30s and 40s today, get a phone call from two different people, both of whom still reside in that town. They don't seem to remember them or the town at all, but decide something is going on and they want to investigate.<br/><i>...and here's character involvement.</i><br/><br/>To add some detail, what's going on here is that the project was pulled and their minds were then wiped clean. Only problem is that many of the town's residents moved right after because even though they couldn't remember, they could feel something horrible had been done to them. So they left and the character's families were with them. Unfortunately, those that were left behind eventually regained their memories and started eating the canned food the experiment leaders had left behind, in order to gain whatever powers they Thule society had hoped they would. Only it turned them into monsters. <br/>All these years later, fueled by hate, they want to destroy everyone that got away and managed to live a normal life, unlike themselves. Thus, the high school reunion.<br/><br/>I will avoid using the flashbacks, as it just happened to come in handy in this particular story. What I did from now on is consider what clues were left behind from this ''ritual'' (you can call it crime) and how the characters can find it. Here goes:<br/><br/><b>Town residents:</b><br/>The age gap should make some characters go ''hmmm''. Essentially there are two age brackets alive in this town: The ones that are around the same age as the characters and really old people. <br/>The old people are remnants of the scientists and service personnel from the experiment. They don't speak English. One of the characters bumped into them on purpose and tried to talk to them, but they wouldn't answer. <br/>Mostly everyone in the town is batshit crazy, something which should shine through, but subtly.<br/><br/><b>Objects:</b><br/>Almost every house in the town has stuff left over from the time of the experiments. Uniforms, lab coats, canned food (of course), guns, all marked as US military, yet...different. <br/>One of the major NPCs still has the corpse of her father in her room. She talks to him.<br/>In any given fridge that belongs to one of the younger people in town, there are half eaten military cans. Why would they still be eating them?<br/><b><br/>Locations:</b><br/>The high school is a death trap. Investigating before the reunion will show that no one has used the place in decades and there are padlocked doors and whatnot.<br/>The military base has been wiped clean but you can probably uncover some stuff there. I usually take cues from the player. If the players dig, they find something. If they look for a bunker, they find a bunker.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255752/#Comment_255752" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-09T10:21:11+00:00" title="February  9, 2010 10:21AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting thread, but you're missing an approach:<br/><br/><b>Style <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> - Induction</b><br/>As GM, you figure out who did what, where, to whom. That sets the crime (or whatever) scene, upon which the PCs will soon stumble. Thereafter, your only task as GM is to decide--on the fly--if the hypotheses that the players suggest would or could lead to that scene. If a clue for which they decide to look fits the situation, then, sure, the players "find" the clue. If it doesn't, they don't (or find a red herring, if you want to torture them). You don't have to seed a thing, hope the PCs find it, and then hope the players can connect the dots; nor do you have to feed them every clue to "craft a story."<br/><br/>Hell, you might even like their "conclusions" more then your prefabricated notion of the situation... and with an inductive approach, you can just switch to their idea on the fly, if you want (so long as their "conclusions" are not invalid given the body of evidence).<br/><br/>This idea was first floated, IIRC, on the RPG.net LARP board, talking about how to run a mystery in a LARP, where seeding clues can waste a lot of time and money (and be seen OOC, which can ruin the mystery). The idea was "why seed? Let them find whatever they look for, so long as it doesn't violate the facts of the crime scene." Someone came along and explained to us that we were talking about inductive logic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255765/#Comment_255765" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-09T11:20:08+00:00" title="February  9, 2010 11:20AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've run murder mystery Matrix Games for years that are different from the styles you've listed. <br/><br/>The players start with a set of opening facts. Then each turn they make up clues. As the clues mount they narrow down who could have done it until one of the players is fingered from the crime.

The cleaverness part and deduction does come in because the players have to figure out what all the clues they made add up to. <br/><br/>The problem with this approach is that it isn't really role playing.

Okay, let's say there's a town plagued by giant dogs.  The adventure includes some fighting them and tracking them.  Both of these tasks require some level of cleverness.  Anyway, the players figure out that the dogs are coming through a dimensional gateway in the shape of a vase.  <br/><br/>They try to smash the vase but it's magically untouchable.  They find an inscription on the vase that's a riddle.   The riddle, if decoded, says, "Fill with holy water at midnight and my magic powers fade."  While the players are decoding that, the GM ups the ante and has the largest dog of all come for them as midnight nears.  <br/><br/>So, a few things can happen:<br/><br/>1) They solve the riddle.  Then there's a dramatic but ultimately manageable scene where they fill the vase with holy water, smash it, and save the town.<br/><br/>2) They fail to solve the riddle, and either die in an obviously mismatched battle, or, if they're not feeling suicidal, they flee.  If they flee, the town is irreperably damaged, and the PCs don't get the reward for saving it.  However, if they subsequently figure out the riddle, they could always go back and approach the scenario in a different context.  (My player went back, filled the vase, but then <i>kept</i> it, so she could study it and maybe launch giant dogs at her enemies!)<br/><br/>3) They come up with some other clever solution based on the already-established facts of the fiction.  Maybe they engineer some weird cage to keep the vase in.  Something the GM hadn't anticipated, but goes, "Yeah, that would work."<br/><br/>Any fears anyone has about how this might not work are probably legit.  But I know for a fact that it <i>can</i> work, and is uniquely satisfying when it does.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255774/#Comment_255774" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-09T11:53:23+00:00" title="February  9, 2010 11:53AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Simon,<br/>So I take it the player-GM communication around an Investigative Ability use makes clear which clues are Core and which aren't?

Love the idea in principle, and really love the satisfaction of solving a toughie in-character, but they're awfully hard to engineer.<br/><br/>I remember getting pulled into a booth at...GenCon '96 or so, maybe. These guys had two softcovers filled with riddles for RPGs. So they challenge me to solve one of their "hard" riddles (they're graded, very sensibly, into "easy", "average" and "hard" in each book). I have a head for these things so I agree. I have it solved before they're done reading off the text. They start another one, and I do the same thing -- at this point I'm being a total jackass to them, something I still regret doing. But they've got this ridiculous arrogance about how tough their riddles are, and 15 years ago my instinct was to respond in kind. <br/><br/>Basically I think it's hard to write a good riddle. It needs poetry to be compelling. It needs to be solveable by someone who isn't you. It needs to be obscure enough to feel rewarding. It needs to be tested, but not with your intended audience.<br/><br/>More trouble than they're worth, IMO. :-( I'll do them very occasionally but only because I know my audience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255836/#Comment_255836" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-09T17:34:54+00:00" title="February  9, 2010  5:34PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just had my reply to this thread totally eaten. To summarize:<br/><br/>David (Berg), in your example, it seems like it's actually the players (and not the characters) who have to figure out the mystery, yeah? Because they're the ones playing Go Fish with the GM about what they're supposed to do with the vase, right? Honestly, in my games, I care very little about "do the players figure out X information." The most important thing is what they do about it and the price they have to pay for uncovering it.  Like, to get information out of the suspect, do they slam his head into the table? That kind of thing.<br/><br/>David (Artman), in your example, it sounds like the GM still has a bunch of clues in mind that the players may or may not find. Also, he is willing to change actual "truth" of the story in response to the theories of the players and so forth. Both of these clash pretty strongly with what I have in mind. Imagine a framework in which there are no clues. There's just NPCs doing things.  Like, if a player decides to search a room for footprints, then I as GM think "Would Jed have tried to cover up his tracks?" and then make a judgment call. Then the PCs get that information or don't, based on how they roll and so on.  How they interpret it, whether it's a clue or not, that's totally up to the players. But the "truth" of the game is real but not fixed, if that makes sense. Events keep rolling on so they're not static, but I don't arbitrarily change what's going on to fit what the characters do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255883/#Comment_255883" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-10T03:12:34+00:00" title="February 10, 2010  3:12AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>Simon, I agree, there's no cleverness in a die roll!

Most non-core clues provide background information rather than leads, although they occasionally lead to optional scenes, and as you say, it's sometimes necessary to get things back on track, sometimes by being explicit about core clues.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255884/#Comment_255884" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-10T03:16:03+00:00" title="February 10, 2010  3:16AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite><b>Style <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> - Induction</b><br/>As GM, you figure out who did what, where, to whom.

You are confusing the abductive process with "didn't think of that" clue creation on the fly. Sure, that's common as rain when deductive (breadcrumb, #1) play is attempted, because it's VERY HARD, as a GM, to figure out in advance every necessary and sufficient clue without creating ambiguity that leads to confusion or false accusations. Players will develop hypotheses against the body of evidence (NOT by imagination--a key difference, it seems to me!) that are at best incomplete (unless they've scoured the game space and found "all the clues").<br/><br/>Your "mix of 1 and 3" is more like "patching sloppy <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>," as I usually see it with "most GMs." Abduction is a completely no-prep, no-confusion (assuming no red herrings), fast iteration process (i.e. the moment that a clue invalidates a hypothesis--by not being present when it "should be" or by pointing in another direction--then a new hypothesis can be immediately formed and continue to check it). Compare that to, say, finding yet another clue (breadcrumb) that doesn't fit.<br/><br/>Induction is building a puzzle out of insufficient pieces (until you have every piece, then it's Deduction).<br/>Abduction is doing a scavenger hunt for the pigments to paint by numbers.<br/>[Wow... edit to replace misused induction with the abduction I meant.]<br/>(Slightly shaky parallels, but I think you follow me.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256332/#Comment_256332" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-12T11:51:41+00:00" title="February 12, 2010 11:51AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 12, 2010 11:57AM by David Artman.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jaywalt</cite>David (Artman), in your example, it sounds like the GM still has a bunch of clues in mind that the players may or may not find. Also, he is willing to change actual "truth" of the story in response to the theories of the players and so forth.</blockquote>No, the GM has no clue in mind. He as the crime scene only. Whether a clue "fits" the crime--a clue proposed by the players and "checked" (mechanically or with mere narration of looking for it)--is determined on the fly, based on if it COULD be there (not IS, by GM determination in advance or "in mind").<br/><br/>As fas as changing the explanation for the resultant crime scene on the fly, that was just an "oh, yeah, and abduction has THIS neat feature, too." It's not mandatory, just a way to "reward" a more-interesting hypothesis by accepting it as "as-yet-unproven solution" to the crime scene while the existing, discovered clues still fit it.\n<blockquote>Imagine a framework in which there are no clues.</blockquote>Precisely. I am.\n<blockquote>There's just NPCs doing things.  Like, if a player decides to search a room for footprints, then I as GM think "Would Jed have tried to cover up his tracks?" and then make a judgment call. Then the PCs get that information or don't, based on how they roll and so on.  How they interpret it, whether it's a clue or not, that's totally up to the players. But the "truth" of the game is real but not fixed, if that makes sense. Events keep rolling on so they're not static, but I don't arbitrarily change what's going on to fit what the characters do.</blockquote>Again, that's just an "advanced, neat-o option" of abduction; it's by no mean the One Way (or even "vanilla abduction").<br/><br/>And finally... I wasn't saying "this is what you want." I was just pointing out that the OP dichotomy is a false one; there's a third way that has less prep, more "narrative flexibility," and encourages creative thinking on the players' parts rather than rote "hoovering up" of breadcrumbs until the pieces have only one way to fit together (or, worse and often, fit together more ways than one, but only one way is "right" because of GM prescription).<br/><br/>Anyhow... whatever works for ya. Just pointing out the way *I'd* do any sort of "investigative storyline" in an RPG henceforth (especially in LARP, for the reasons given above).<br/>[edit to say "abduction" where I said "induction".

Just like writing a ten-page character history and then never having it become relevant to play would be a waste of time.<br/><br/>(I do think that this has much to do with available time: if I had an unlimited amount of time at my disposal, and so did my group, it might be worthwhile to create this sort of information simply to invest the game with a little more richness. But in real, practical terms, it seems to be very much a case of diminishing returns to me.)<br/><br/>(You'll also note that my game <i>Land of Nodd</i> often creates unresolved mysteries, and I'm OK with that. But that's largely because no one had to waste their time writing up the solution to that mystery. It's just a point that's fine to speculate about: in our Imperial China/Wushu game, where did that plague, and the dead corpse in the wheelbarrow, come from? We never found out. We might have fun hanging out and comparing theories, but no one feels like their effort was wasted.)<br/><br/>My only attempts to run investigative-style games were while playing traditional, task-resolution-supporting-type games (like D&amp;D and GURPS). My experience with those games is that unless the GM willingly revealed information to the players (as in your Style #2), the mystery was NEVER revealed. A "simple" mystery would last for months (sometimes years) of game sessions, with each session adding to the mystery--which was enjoyable--but the big reveal would never come to the open unless the GM gave up on "Style #1" play and gave out more information than was warranted. What happened in those games, instead, was that the stories of the characters gradually outgrew the importance of "the mystery", until the mystery was pretty much forgotten. In many cases, the GM would now and then try to bump it back into people's consciousness ("Hey, guys! Remember that funny statuette you picked up?"), but that would rarely have any effect for more than 10 minutes or so.<br/><br/>This happened in pretty much every game of this sort I can remember, both as player and GM. Inevitably, the players were more interested in what was happening to their characters (or _between_ their characters) than any kind of overarching mystery created by the GM. I suspect that was sometimes just a way of making sure the game didn't get too boring ("We're stalled on this mystery thing? How about my character falls in love with the same guy as yours? Now we can have fun roleplaying with each other for the next hour instead of banging our heads against the table.").<br/><br/>I also saw a lot of (generally short term or one-shot) games where a complex background created some interesting and unexplained situations and behaviour in play ("Why is the Duke disappearing every night?" "How did this young pipsqueak inherit his title?" "Why won't the young doctor agree to my very favourable deal?" etc...). These games were fun, but, to be fully satisfying, involved the players hanging out with the GM afterwards and basically asking questions: "So, who was behind the murder? What was that thing with the needle we found all about?" Because the actual mystery was rarely revealed in play unless there was some heavy-handed Style <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> going on, whether from players or GM.<br/><br/>My <i>successful</i> investigative-type games went something like this:<br/><br/>Create a mystery, figure out what kind of clues it might leave behind. Now strip out <i>everything except those clues</i>. In other words, create a small setting within which every possible element the PCs might interact with provide some clue to the mystery. This is exactly like the Dogs Town Creation process, I'd say: every NPC you interact with will tell you something about what's going on, even if it's a lie. From what I can tell, this is also what made George's (northerain's) high school reunion scenario successful. Literally everything in that town the PCs enter is abnormal: a clue to Something Wrong.<br/><br/>If every single NPC is involved in the mystery, you CAN simply play the NPCs as you would any invested character and the game will go, as Jonathan (jaywalt) suggests. But if many of the NPCs are completely unrelated to the mystery, you can't (unless I'm missing something, Jonathan!).<br/><br/>In those games, there would also have to be either a strong goal the PCs were driving towards or an imminent threat. Something to keep things moving. Sooner or later a climax of some sort would be reached, when the mystery would be revealed (because it's tied to either player goals or the imminent threat). The satisfaction for the players was to be able to say, "I told you so!" (or, better yet, make preparations to deal with the reveal) when the mystery was finally revealed. Perhaps "less successful" in this case would be total surprise on the part of the players and "more successful" would be grim satisfaction at having figured things beforehand. ("Ha! I knew he was the killer all along!")<br/><br/>Now that I have more exposure to indie/story games, I'd say that mechanics which allow the players to strongly state goals and intents (such as stake setting games) and/or coerce NPCs help investigative games, in that they protect the GM from her own turtling. Storming the Wizard's Tower helps move things along, as well, through the conversation/social conflict rules, which allow players to get information from NPCs (or even out of thin air!) reliably. Other than that, I'm not too sure about system impact. Though I suspect any process that is reliably fun (e.g. Dogs' Town Creation + GM advice) will magnetically draw the group away from the less fun stuff, keeping them focused on the type of play you want.<br/><br/>I can say, however regretfully, that I have NEVER seen a game which a) depended fully on the cleverness of the players, without offering some kind of back door, and b) was reliably fun. How can you match the difficulty of the puzzles to the players' intelligence, and do so consistently?<br/><br/>I'd love to see a game that does, though! I've just never seen one myself (either in terms of game design or in terms of gameplay/scenario/GM/group skills).<br/><br/>Great thread!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_257159">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257159/#Comment_257159" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-19T04:25:16+00:00" title="February 19, 2010  4:25AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David,<br/><br/>A crime or setup that someone has down and thought through, with some background research, with some plausible and interesting clues which result from that, combined with on the fly determination of the success of player suggestions is not what I would call "patching" anything. I think it is a positive benefit to have a clue for which there is no (current) hypothesis.<br/><br/>Perhaps I don't understand you. You've said that the GM has decided what has happened, to whom, and when. At this point, I would decide some pieces of evidence that the murderer left behind, perhaps someone who might have plausibly witnessed the crime. Where did they go afterwards, why did they do it, who else plausibly might be a potential suspect. I find that thinking these things through in advance and maybe doing a little bit of research will lead to a more interesting and involved mystery than just making stuff up or reacting to player input on the fly. If you have predetermined who did the crime, then there <i>is</i> a correct hypothesis, against which their investigative attempts are measured.<br/><br/>Could you please write a very short opener of how such an adventure might begin in your "abductive" form, and how it might differ?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_257174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257174/#Comment_257174" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-19T11:21:05+00:00" title="February 19, 2010 11:21AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [It's not my form, it's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning" rel="nofollow">Charles Pierce's</a>, but I'll try to make a clear example.]<br/><br/><span style="color: #0000FF;"><b>Scene</b><br/>The PCs come into a room where a window is open, a husband and wife are bloodied and dead, and the room is in disarray.</span><br/><br/>That's it.

How do they determine that? Do I have to scatter hairs about the place, make claw marks up the wall outside, etc? No. The PCs--the lot of them with their creativity and capacity to imagine FAR wilder shit than I could--instead ask stuff like:<br/><br/>"Was the room's disarray caused by the people struggling?" - I know the answer is Yes, because I imagine the wolf busting in, startling them, and some struggle. I might have that PC make a check to see if he or she could tell that from the room--after all, I haven't actually put the room into disarray (in a LARP, I might not even have enough props to furnish and accessorize a room!).<br/><br/>"What do the wounds look like?" - Medicine or Forensics check (and maybe a secret Animal Knowledge check for a PC or two) and I might reply, "Tears and rends, not cuts and stabs" or even go so far as to say, "bite and claw marks, larger than any you've ever seen," depending upon their ability.<br/><br/>"We go outside and check the house under the roof--are there claw marks on the wall?" Why yes, yes there are.<br/>"And in the soil below the window, where the beast leaped down?" Yep.<br/><br/>...And so forth. It will take some ingenuity on the PCs' part to make the beast -&gt; werewolf connection, and then to figure out which (N)PC is the werewolf; but the cool thing is that the GMs don't have to seed the world with enough stuff to point all that out. The players ask, a GM considers, knowing the Solution, and replies based on logic and the PC's abilities. Should the PCs get stuck--not able to imagine a hypothesis and thus can't test it for evidence availability--then the GMs resort to any one of a host of tricks one would employ with breadcrumb (deductive) or railroad (guaranteed solution, "investigation" only in service of story or color) methods in the OP: The Observant And Helpful NPC (AKA Look HERE You Tards!), The Reluctant Witness (AKA The Finger), Another Crime (AKA This Time With Feeling!), Close Enough For Government Work (AKA Say Anything So We Can Move On!), and any number of other tricks. But I would think it more rare for the PCs to get stuck with abduction than with deduction--they're making up the case, after all!<br/><br/>And, thus, it is a Third Way. Not a One True Way.

Why? Organizers/GMs and players often arrive at the same time at a venue; thus, the players can (accidentally or intentionally) see where clues are seeded. Sure, GMs can rope off or restrict access to areas that are being so prepped, but then you run the risk of the Easter Egg Hunt effect--everyone KNOWS the verboten area will have all the clues and they are snatched up within minutes. And THEN you have the risk that the game becomes "how can I profit from sharing my key clue" not "investigation that leads to an eventual confrontation." Yuck.<br/><br/>Abduction's principle drawback in LARP is coordinating GMs and GM availability. For the former, all GMs must know the Solution, so that they can be asked by any player at any time. And even with a high GM:player ratio, you can end up having trouble providing a GM "everywhere" (i.e. where the players think to go look).  As a result, abductive mystery investigation is a lot like the requirements of a line module; all GMs ready and available and on the same page; NPCs (if any) prepped and in place, etc. And some LARPs just can't do line modules well, for lack of organizers/GMs/NPCs/assistants, etc.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon Rogers</cite>If the players were to say "We search the room. What do we find?" You'd make it up, I'd have most of it written down.</blockquote>That wouldn't be a valid action, really. That's not any different from saying, "I kill that goblin" in a live combat game. No, you don't, unless you go over there, catch up to him, and do it with your padded weapon. It's no different from saying, "No, YOU explain what I do or say to push forward these dice" in DitV. Abductive play is a way to provide players with agency, and they can't just thrust it back onto the GMs... unless they are basically saying, "We quit--tell us the Solution so we can move on," at which point I'd use another trick first, rather than just cave in.<br/><br/>Huh... and there's, probably, the last and BEST thing about it, compared to deduction: if they give up and just want the Solution, I haven't wasted a bunch of time building up a lock-tight logical set of provided clues!<br/><br/>As Graham says, there's a lot of differences between abduction and deduction (not to mention presentation). Sure, you can do "abduction on the fly" within a deductive mystery--most have to do so I'd imagine, which is yet-another argument for dispensing with the prep altogether, to my mind. But you can't really do "deduction on the fly" (i.e. seed clues on the fly which are sufficient but not necessary to find the Solution, in any random location the PCs might wander), and so there's is not a reciprocal relationship between the methods. And if not reciprocal, not identical.

It is very, very hard to provide clues that in the least bit challenge the players (to think, to find them, whatever) and yet have only a single possible logical Solution. You might have a gift for it and so don't realize it, but most people can't build evocative mysteries consistently (those who can make BIG money writing them into novels, I hear).<br/><br/>Furthermore, an ideal set of clues (body of evidence) would have to be acquired in full before the logic of the Solution would be evident, otherwise you have superfluous clues or clues that run the risk of being misleading, right? But that means that missing even ONE of them will leave the PCs stuck, so the GMs' tack then becomes to seed redundant version of each key fact in the logical chain. More prep, more props.<br/><br/>I wasn't coming in here to say "abduction is superior"... but, hell, I've persuaded myself just by comparing and contrasting it with the deduction method. (I find the presentation method so orthogonal--with such an utterly different play agenda--that it's not even fair to compare... oh, yeah, and so that answers the OP, for me!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258103/#Comment_258103" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-24T10:27:11+00:00" title="February 24, 2010 10:27AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, interesting.  Whenever I've heard "abduction" used to refer to RPG fiction creation, "assumption" would have worked just as well.  Artman, what you describe -- looking at some facts and then adding new facts by referencing an evovling concept of "what went on here" -- sounds to me like a very quick cycle of induction-&gt;deduction.  I know obsessing over terminology is a waste of time, but I do think it's interesting to try to look at the mental process in detail.<br/><br/>Anyway, I think that this way of responsively defining hidden facts could be attempted in support of either style <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> (challenge players to deduce) or style <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> (don't really force them to deduce).  I suspect most GMs would find this a difficult way to create real challenges, but hey, maybe not.  I've actually had a <i>few</i> moments of success doing exactly this!<br/><br/>So Paul, there's an assist to your "lotsa wasted prep" dilemma.  As for your issue of playing for hours without solving the mystery, surely that's a sign of poor mystery-adventure design.  Which is probably the bulk of the problem a good <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231-style&amp;Mode=like">#1-style</a> game design would need to solve.  Let me throw out an example.  It's what I've been doing on and off in Delve.  It compromises <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> as soon as the going gets tough, but starts out with <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> in mind.<br/><br/>There is a problem.  There is a one right way to solve the problem.  That is Task <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a>.  There are 3 clues that will get you to Task <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a> with enough info to have a chance of solving it.  These 3 clues can be acquired by performing Tasks <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, 2 and 3.  Everything in the fiction is set up to point at one of these 4 Tasks.  The players can wander around and flesh out the color of the situation if they want, but everything they look for ends up saying "go do a Task".  If the 4 Tasks are of a reasonable difficulty level (usually this means easy but not immediately obvious), the process of solving the first 3 will not take hours and hours.  Especially if there's some vague clock ticking -- a simple sense of "things here are getting worse!" is usually quite sufficient.  So far, all this is in keeping with the spirit of style <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, but is really just fodder for it.  So now we get to the crux.  The players have 3 clues.  They know what they have to use that information for -- Task #4: solve the scenario's problem.<br/><br/>Did the GM design his big scenario puzzle well enough?  How tall an order is that?  Well, here's the thing -- in playing through everything up to this point, there's been plenty of opportunity for the GM to make sure his clues have been properly received.  To realize, "Oh, they breezed over that important detail I mentioned, and may have forgotten it.  I'll have an NPC remind them."  So, the GM makes sure the players have the needed information.  The scenario ensures that the players <i>know they needed this info</i>, instead of banging their heads against Task <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a> before gathering the clues.  <br/><br/>So, at this point, success or failure hinges of whether the GM can devise one satisfying logical task.  I've been calling this "deductive" because of the cultural familiarity with that term in this context, but it's really inductive and then deductive.  "We have 3 clues.  What does that tell us about the scenario?  Given what we've induced about the scenario, what can we deduce about how to fix it?"  I don't yet have a system to help GMs do this.  Just trying it myself, sometimes I succeed, and sometimes I don't*.  But this doesn't seem an insurmountable challenge.<br/><br/>*When I don't succeed, then I wind up helping, starting with improvized extra clues.  Sometimes this even works without ruining the challenge!  Other times, I do enough of the work for the players that it really isn't much of a challenge, and style <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> gives way to style <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, where most of the fun comes from fixing the problem in a dramatic way (e.g. "Just in the nick of time!") rather than having earned it with logical skills.  This only works sometimes, and only if I have players who are flexible enough to enjoy style <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> or style <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, and only if they can forgive the clumsy transition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258245/#Comment_258245" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-24T15:28:10+00:00" title="February 24, 2010  3:28PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2010 3:29PM by Paul_T.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave,<br/><br/>If you're talking to me, that's what I mean by "the games that were successful": you design the fiction so that _everything_ is a clue, in some way, towards the Task or mystery of what have you.

You suggest clues in the form of questions (not open ended ones) and the GM accepts or rejects them according to the original theory. I'd be happy to try such a game, but "not noticing things" which would be obvious, such as "the entire wall is covered in blood" would be, well, different. Are there any such games? It's a little more than just adapting a normal game system. It's what I'd call a 20 questions mystery.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>But you can't really do "deduction on the fly" (i.e. seed clues on the fly which are sufficient but not necessary to find the Solution, in any random location the PCs might wander), and so there's is not a reciprocal relationship between the methods.</blockquote>\nI really can, and so can most people who have GM'ed for me, again unless I misunderstand you. At any one point, the clues don't have to point to a specific mystery; it's as you get more clues the possibilities narrow down as the players eleminate the false ones. It's really not that hard. The chances are that if they are narrowing down the possibilities, they will end up on the original trail anyway.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>It is very, very hard to provide clues that in the least bit challenge the players (to think, to find them, whatever) and yet have only a single possible logical Solution.

There can be multiple possible solutions in players' minds. The players follow their theories and eliminate the ones that are wrong, using the information you provide. If they go in an unexpected direction, they could be following a plausible lead, or one which does not confirm their theory. You've got the event and the way it was caused clearly in your head, those people involved and where they are. Everything the players say is measured against that.<br/><br/>For example, let's say you haven't considered CCTV footage of your werewolf leaving the building. You decide there was a CCTV camera, and offer up a blurred picture of a dog-like creature. Let's say one of the players thinks its a dog, and looks for hairs, and you didn't consider that either in your prep. You tell them, no, they are not dog hairs, but something very similar. Maybe they ask - is there a caretaker for the building, answer yes or know as you please, decide whether or not he heard anything and describe it. That is, assuming you didn't think of it earlier and prep it. How is this difficult?<br/><br/>In our very substantial playtesting of GUMSHOE adventures (and I mean getting on a hundred playtests, with many GMs), I haven't detected much problem with GMs being able to improvise when they need, and having to improvise much. We had a very peculiar situation in the first Esoterrorist playtests where two groups complained of railroading, and they were they only two groups where the GM was improvising like mad!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258270/#Comment_258270" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-24T16:36:58+00:00" title="February 24, 2010  4:36PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2010 4:38PM by David_Berg.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Oh, also: what are Tasks <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>?</blockquote>Self-contained puzzles, usually.

It's <i>not only</i> super easy; it's zero prep, AND it's zero cost (again, a big issue with deductive mystery design in LARPs).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258455/#Comment_258455" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-25T09:14:48+00:00" title="February 25, 2010  9:14AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave,<br/><br/>Sorry, my question was incomplete, maybe.

There are other forms of creativity in roleplaying games than narrative control over the mystery. Deciding to look for CCTV footage and explaining how to get it takes creativity. Roleplaying interpersonal skills takes creativity, it's just not the same creativity as "collaborating to decide the cause of a mystery". It's not less creative, it's creativity directed elsewhere.<br/><br/>If you consider a game where we all sit down in a circle and take it in turns to add to a story, for example, than a roleplaying game with a pre-determined cause for a mystery, I'll accept this is a semantic discussion, and we differ on the definition of "creativity." I too am signing out, as I think we have got as far as we can in this medium.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258603/#Comment_258603" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-25T21:30:06+00:00" title="February 25, 2010  9:30PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 25, 2010 9:31PM by David_Berg.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, <br/><br/>Yep.<br/><br/>Also:  For a sim-style GM, I am <i>incredibly</i> lazy about prep.
