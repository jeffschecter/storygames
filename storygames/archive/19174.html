Sorry it's about something I did rather than adding to the existing discussion, but I don't have anything else to contribute to the discussion just now, and I don't think posting just to post is a good idea. That said, here goes: I'm writing a wuxia genre Apocalypse World hack, and I'd appreciate any feedback. So far all I have is the basic moves, none of which are wildly original, but which I think have some interesting twists. It's playable at this stage, something I am immensely proud of as a newbie* game designer. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LLYJWd5DWGpKGxvx_o2su83RLFp8Co3NL0fwwMdobwE/edit#heading=h.lgad3tp0gd97" rel="nofollow">Here 's a link to the gdoc</a>.<br/><br/>The biggest twists on the basic mechanics so far are based on strings, from Monsterhearts, and power, from the first version of Just Heroes. <br/><br/>In the first case, I took the idea of strings as points representing a social hold over other characters pretty much wholesale, but I've expanded on it in a manner that I think is pretty significant. In order to represent the networks of relationships that are so important in Chinese culture as a whole (at least according to my reading) and in Confucian philosophy in particular, I'm adding the option to spend five strings to establish a permanent "tie." A character can use strings on anyone they are connected to through the network of ties, though each degree of separation increases the cost of a string action.<br/><br/>With the power mechanic, I used the concept to points gained by specific actions and used both to improve short term circumstances and gain advances, but adjusted the advancement mechanic. I modeled my implementation on Hx in Apocalypse World, with the stat I'm calling cosmic breath added to certain rolls, but resetting and granting XP every time a fourth point is earner<br/><br/>Altogether, while I know I don't have anything terribly original yet, I think I've got a solid platform to build more content on.<br/><br/>Opinions?<br/><br/>*The only other thing I've done is Adrift, an AW powered storygame which I worked on with this site's own inestimable Dani and which needs more playtesting.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427706/#Comment_427706" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-28T00:28:52+00:00" title="January 28, 2014 12:28AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like the name: it's simple and descriptive, so potential players know what they're getting into upfront, i.e. it's a wuxia game using AWE.

Strings work best when the PCs are constantly in conflict with each other, which may not be as common in your hack as it is in MonsterHearts.<br/><br/>In the first draft of my own Wuxia/Anime hack, I used a system based on strings and it fell completely flat in play--the characters just never had a reason to spend it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427708">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427708/#Comment_427708" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-28T01:14:11+00:00" title="January 28, 2014  1:14AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 28, 2014 1:47AM by horn_head_o.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I echo arscott's concern regarding Strings: the way they are mechanically in MH, they both result-from and are built to cause people exerting their control over others. Like, there's only one option on the MH list of String uses that can be at all beneficial for a person.<br/>Not to say that the mechanical concept of Strings can't be used. Just wanted to underscore the "be cautious" vibe there.<br/><br/>I dunno if you already know of it or if it's actually appropriate to cite (as it's also a little self-serving <img alt=":/" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/confused.png" title=":/"/>) but I also have my own ApW hack called <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17429/avatar-world-version-1-2-released" rel="nofollow">Avatar World</a> that primarily does Avatar the Last Airbender but is also built to accommodate Wuxia-style play as well.

I agree that descriptors would help. While the one you wrote ("metal cuts through illusions...") would be good for the rules text, that could be hard to fit on the playbooks for all five stats, and you can't rely on everyone to read the rulebook. <br/>That said, stat names and their connotations and how you'll describe them in the text is nitpicky right now as long as <i>you</i> know what they mean, so I'll not talk further there.<br/>I do like Cosmic Breath though. It's cool and evocative.<br/><br/>How do I "Receive Wisdom From The Universe"? I see what you're going for, but as a player I'm not sure what I could do fictionally to instigate that move, the trigger doesn't seem all that player-facing. Do I get it when I meditate on a thing? Can I receive a flash of brilliance in the middle of an action scene?<br/><br/>In general, the list of basic moves is very similar to Apocalypse World's, in concept if not in shape. Are there any actions within the genre that you think are especially representative of the genre? Are any of the actions you've included not really that huge of a thing in wuxia compared to their prevalence in the post-apocalypse?<br/>(as far as action types go, my personal opinion is that the list is mostly fine, but it's an important thing to look at when working on a hack I think)<br/><br/>Is resetting Cosmic Breath the only way to gain XP?<br/><br/>I like the concept of Ties, but the specific use of them (chaining your Strings on them onto their Ties) seems like it could get awfully complicated, with players either writing a ton down on their sheets to keep track of who they spend Strings on or having to ask each other all the time.<br/><br/>The Backstory Ties (the ones at character creation) are really cool. Should they explicitly be with PCs or NPCs or a mix? Also, considering the size of the list, you might drop it to two options, or in even a four player game you're going to get a lot of similar relationships cropping up, let alone a five player game. Even with only two or three PCs, that would be up to four or six NPCs, which seems more than enough to start a game with.<br/>Maybe some of the list stuff could be negative stuff? Rivals, nemesis, or other stuff if you're having them make up some NPCs.<br/>An alternative to just straight-up expanding the list, maybe the list is playbook-sensitive? So different sorts of people have different sorts of connections they've made? <br/>(also, is "sworn siblings" like unrelated-but-super-close, blood-brothers type stuff? I just don't know the phrase)<br/><br/>Alright, I'll shut up now. Hopefully there's some stuff you haven't already thought of in there. For the record, I really like the start you've got, Keep Your Head is super tight, the use of Strings is a small list but is well-handled, the whole Cosmic Breath thing is cool, and everything looks usable, perhaps just needing optimization or refinement or the like. Keep it up, this is good-looking!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/arscott" title="arscott"><img alt="arscott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/arscott">arscott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427822/#Comment_427822" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-30T16:32:13+00:00" title="January 30, 2014  4:32PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, "Go Aggro", and it being a basic move says that AW is a place where people can use violence to get results, but also that using violence to get results is, on some level, ceding power to the person you're threatening.  It says that using violence to get results is going to be complicated and messy.<br/><br/>When I was reading your moves before, Sway with Threats was unfinished and it looked like it was going to come out close to the "Go Aggro" move.  Since then, you've clearly made it your own thing:  Whereas the use of violent threats in the Apocalypse World is likely to get messy, the use of violent threats in Wuxia World interacts with cosmic breath.  How do you see that working in the fiction of the game?<br/><br/>I think Horn Head is absolutely right about choosing basic moves to shape the world/setting you're going for.  For instance, my own hack is thematically similar to Avatar and Fullmetal Alchemist: Young people mastering their skills as they explore a world suffering from war.<br/><br/>Here's my own list of basic moves:<br/>Stone Fist:  Train and Practice, Fight in a Stone Fist Stance<br/>River Serpent: Dance Past Danger, Act with Stealth, Fight in a River Serpent Stance<br/>Dragon's Belly: Bare your Soul, Fight in a Dragon's Belly Stance<br/>Paper Crane: Spin clever words, Fight in a Paper Crane Stance<br/>Eye of Heaven: Study a Moment, Study a Person, Fight in an Eye of Heaven Stance<br/><br/>Notice that I've dropped Go Aggro and Seize by Force (which don't really fit the way violence works in my world), while still having a bunch of moves that communicate how violence does work (different martial styles, which mean that there's always a form of combat tied to a character's good stat.  Also, my version of AW's special moves are triggered not by sex, but by characters dueling each other)<br/><br/>I've also ditched Open Your Brain while adding in Train and Practice and Bare your Soul.  Because OYB is about learning new information about the world.  Because this hack isn't one where the characters learn about the weirdness of the world.  Its one where they learn about themselves and about each other--and so my basic moves reflect that, while directing the characters to participate in the sorts of scenes that occur regularly in the fiction I'm trying to emulate.<br/><br/>The point here is that your basic moves help define your world.  When the players aren't sure what to do, this is the list they'll be looking at (especially if you use highlighted stats).  So choose a set of basic moves that gets you what you want.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
