No, and I am currently suffering a few challenges because I had missed a few of the early questions.   The questions are meant to be addressed over the course of the design, so that you can focus on the aspects that really matter at this point in time.<br/><br/>One of my current problems is that I am currently somewhere between steps 6 and 7 on my current project.  I seem to be distracting myself with questions of layout, art, production, planning for sales and marketing.  I am putting the cart ahead of the horse because I didn't have a structured foundation to work upon.  I realize now that I need to focus on the playtesting and editing tasks. <br/><br/>Thanks for reading!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Pitre" title="Jason_Pitre"><img alt="Jason_Pitre" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/963/nF2ZB6ZWC4SFX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Pitre">Jason_Pitre</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297098/#Comment_297098" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-16T15:49:54+00:00" title="October 16, 2010  3:49PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>I feel like that is a bit more complicated than it needs to be.<br/><br/>*clip*<br/></blockquote>\nAgreed, it's long and overly complicated.  That said, it is meant to pass on a few tips to very new designers and make them consider a few factors that might not immediately come to mind.  When I started off, I didn't realize that there was any option _other_ then Offset, that there were multiple kinds of playtesting or the value of a one-line mission statement for my game.  For anyone with experience, this list is fairly unecessary as you have likely already internalized most if not all of the questions. <br/><br/>Thanks, especially for your more succinct list!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_297114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297114/#Comment_297114" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-16T23:47:40+00:00" title="October 16, 2010 11:47PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm wary of mixing design and publishing in the same checklist.<br/><br/>For your first design, don't you think all of those options get in the way of the actual design?

A good number of the questions are also in place to help with the core design process by defining your design goals.  <br/><br/>I likely did a poor job of explaining how that document is best used.   It is meant to ask the production, sales and marketing questions after you have finished all of the design work and refinement.  That said, your methods of production might affect your design in a significant fashion.  Time &amp; Temp was clearly designed in a fashion to match that production method.  <br/><br/>If it can help a single person design their game successfully, I will feel my time was well spent.

What is their goal?<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect your intent was that someone would come up with the "why" as they tried to answer those questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm a firm believer that whether business concerns should be part of your design process completely depends on what your goal is. For certain goals, making design decisions based on business restrictions can be very beneficial.<br/>\n<br/>\nSettlers of Catan completely revolutionized the modern boardgame world. But the designer's original game was a Frankenstein that merged the base Settlers game, Seafarers, and Cities and Knights into 1 monster game. It would have not been such an amazing success if the designer published it as is without external considerations. Luckily the designer was working for a company who had them rework the design based on business goals and the game was much, much better for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me the problem with marketing / publishing concerns mixed with design is when a person doesn't really care about making money or isn't designing a game for anyone other than themselves of their friends. This happens quite a bit! Being clear about your goal helps you from wasting time. Many people design as a mental exercise. It's fun! Mixing business into that exercise probably won't help them. But if someone wants to make money, that's a completely different situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_297224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297224/#Comment_297224" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-18T10:14:03+00:00" title="October 18, 2010 10:14AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Game Design: Steps to Publish an RPG</cite>Step 2: Market Research<br>Never skip this all important step; this is where you find out if some kind soul has _already_ written your dream game.
