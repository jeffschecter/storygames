However, I saw the other day that a designer I know (sorry, can't remember who offhand, and which game) is writing quickstart rules BEFORE going on to develop them for longer term play. Now at first blush this struck me as a bit counter-intuitive: wouldn't it make more sense to design the standard rules first, and then boil them down to a quickstart ruleset later? But I then I thought about it a bit and decided that it <i>might</i> be a good way to proceed, but I'm not completely persuaded. <br/><br/>So, what are folks' thoughts on the idea of designing quickstart rules first, and gong on to expand them later? what are the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445458/#Comment_445458" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-01T16:12:43+00:00" title="June  1, 2015  4:12PM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lady Blackbird comes to mind...<br/><br/>It's certainly a better way to get immediate playtesting done!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d" title="Archangel3d"><img alt="Archangel3d" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nHJSFRW82OXJ8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d">Archangel3d</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445461/#Comment_445461" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-01T17:25:43+00:00" title="June  1, 2015  5:25PM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hum...

It's foolishness to build out the entire ruleset before you start playtesting. The more rules you've built out initially, the more changes you have to make to your game when playtesting finds problems with some of your rules. You need to start with your core, and make sure that's stable, before you work in peripheral rules and options. It's an iterative process.<br/><br/>Round 1: make sure the core is solid<br/>Round 2: using the core as a foundation, test various subsystems<br/>Round 3: within the established context of the core and subsystems, test different character and gameplay options to make sure they're at least roughly balanced mechanically<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445466/#Comment_445466" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-02T09:11:17+00:00" title="June  2, 2015  9:11AM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 11, 2015 7:16AM by BeePeeGee.">edited June 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not only for development and playtesting, also for <i>documentation</i> of the complete game I find it essential that you are first able to express the essence of your game in a 1-2 pages.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d" title="Archangel3d"><img alt="Archangel3d" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nHJSFRW82OXJ8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d">Archangel3d</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445471/#Comment_445471" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-02T13:53:29+00:00" title="June  2, 2015  1:53PM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Honestly, I feel that this is something that I will adopt for the future.

Basically, "system" is the structure of the game that enables the players to manipulate the fictional space, while rules mechanics are merely a variety of tools that players use to structure and facilitate this process. Having a GM is part of the "system", while rolling dice pools is part of "mechanics".)<br/><br/>Creating simple rules first only makes sense if you're working in a design space with a well-defined systematic framework underlying your work. Effectively, you already do have a complete game, it just happens to be one that can be mechanized in lighter of weightier ways depending on specific needs.<br/><br/>I cannot recommend trying to make a "light" version of your game before designing the "real game" as an universal practice, simply because thinking about design in this way is counter-productive to putting down the actual system of your game. Game design often occurs in the context of an implicit system (e.g. the traditional "GM narrates an adventure, players decide what their characters do"), and in those cases it is entirely feasible to work bottom-up, relying on the pre-existing, often somewhat implicit systemic framework. However, if your game happens to require a new, weird system, then you'll find it essentially impossible to develop that bottom-up - the system is such a thorough center of a game that you cannot create some sort of a light version first and then go on to expand on it; that makes sense for rules mechanics, but not for the system of play itself.<br/><br/>For example, if you're doing a D&amp;D variant of some sort, then it is entirely feasible to start simple and work your way up to your preferred density of mechanical complexity; the pre-existence of the actual system of play with the GM role, adventuring party and dungeoneering procedures makes it possible for you to play fast and loose with the mechanical details. However, if you were doing something like say <i>My Life with Master</i>, it would be impossible to create a lightweight mechanization of the game <i>before</i> you'd figured out the actual system of play. As it happens, the game text of MLwM actually <i>is</i> pretty much the minimal mechanical treatment on its concept, so you could presumably work up from there to add more rules now that the game has a well-conceived and functional system, plus the "quickstart" rules mechanics <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445475/#Comment_445475" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-02T15:01:08+00:00" title="June  2, 2015  3:01PM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 2, 2015 3:49PM by Airk.">edited June 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you're not actually disagreeing with us, Eero.   <br/><br/>In both cases you need to define the "minimum viable text" or, to put it another way, "the simplest possible rules" for your game - no frills, no extras, no potentially optional processes, etc, first.

(I'm a big fan of Vincent Baker's philosophy of <a href="http://lumpley.com/index.php/anyway/thread/594" rel="nofollow">concentric game design</a> for this reason.)<br/><br/>For example, I might have a core die mechanic that I really need to make sure is working correctly, so I write that up first and test it out, to make sure it's taking inputs and putting outputs out. Then I write up the modules where it interfaces with the narrative in different ways, and test those out. As I go back to the game, I first make corrections to the fundamental pieces of it, then start to smooth out the seams between the parts.<br/><br/>It's rather like software development, in that way.

An experienced designer generally does not need to run e.g. dicing exercises that we hear people doing sometimes, because they can predict what the given arrangement will do. What they will need to test for, though, is unexpected emergent behaviour caused by the specific interaction of all the components that go into their design. Of course not all of the components are equally likely to cause significant knock-on effects, but many do.<br/><br/>(If the medium the designer was working with had complex components and simple interactions, like e.g. software design, then the situation would be the exact reverse: you would write up expected behavior specs for the various components, and how they'll ideally interrelate, and then test each module thoroughly in isolation to make sure it works as intended.)<br/><br/>To illustrate this, an example: we would not generally expect a designer of a D&amp;D-like game to have to "test" their d20+stat rolls to ensure that they have the expected functionality - they are probably pretty justified in expecting that the dice will provide a flat random distribution, moved up or down in the natural number space by their simple linear modifier. However, we would expect them to test how the dice handling fits in with their combat system's multitude of other components, with possible effects ranging from dice interpretation (do the dice provide for the right kind of random input at right times) to handling time (is this dice mechanic too hard to use for its intended purpose).<br/><br/>Of course one can speculate about games that are so deep and complex that they have an ordinary game's worth of emergent complexity in mere subsystems. I guess that it <i>would</i> be meaningful to test Ars Magica combat rules in isolation from the rest of the game (although, to be fair, that's also an example of the vice of detached design - the game does not need that combat system to be itself in the first place). I would consider these cases to be more of an exception than a rule in tabletop game design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445490/#Comment_445490" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-02T22:25:48+00:00" title="June  2, 2015 10:25PM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another aspect is dealing with the overall creative goals of your game. There may be subsystems that function marvelously well by themselves, but need to be removed or modified because they distract from another goal or point of focus, lend too much or too little weight where it's not needed (as in Eero's Ars Magica combat system example), or simply because players, when encountering them, tend to make wrong assumptions about something else in the game.
