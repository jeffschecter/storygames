There are female leprechauns, although they seem to be quite few in number. Leprechauns are elusive, quick witted, and have magical powers to vanish into thin-air. They have fantastically good memories, but they tend to harbor grievances. Older leprechauns are known for being solitary, preferring their own company\u2014however, in their youth, they\u2019ve been known on occasion go trooping in search of treasure. Most \u2018Big Folk\u2019 see Leprechauns as diminutive rogues who cannot be trusted and will deceive whenever possible. They are lustful, nasty, capricious fey whose shenanigans might delight you one day and kill you the next if you displease them.<br/><br/><br/>Around three-feet tall, Leprechauns most often wear green or red pants buckled at the knee with a matching coat and shoes with silver buckles on the tops. Sometimes they wear a pointed cap or jaunty hat (adorned with a four-leaf clover), and may be smoking a pipe. They have a fondness of drinking beer, wine, and whiskey. But love moonshine with a passion. Leprechauns are excellent musicians who are said to play the fiddle, harp, and tin whistles, while having wild revelries in the moonlight where many faeries gather to dance, sing and drink. <br/><br/><br/>Older leprechauns are cobblers\u2014having long given up their wandering ways. They make shoes for fairies. Fairies love to dance and will frequently dance the night away wearing and ruining their tiny fairy shoes. When this happens, the leprechauns are kept happy and busy; paid by the fairies for their trade. But sometimes there aren\u2019t fairy dances, so there are no fairy shoes to be mended. It is during times like these that the leprechauns will venture into the mortal world in search of work.<br/><br/><br/>When this happens, a leprechaun will knock on a human\u2019s door begging for work in the hopes that you have shoes in need of mending. If you do, the leprechaun will happily take them away to be fixed and return them, as good as new, when he is done. In exchange for his services he will be paid a gold or silver coin, which he would take to hide away at the end of the rainbow with the rest of his treasure (usually a pot of gold hidden in the hollow of a Fairy Tree). It is said that if you can capture a Leprechaun (or, in some stories, steal their coin purse) you can barter their freedom for their treasure (pot of gold) or granting the person three wishes.<br/><br/>Molday\u2019s Halflings are described as:<br/><br/>\u201cHalflings are small, good-natured demi-humans averaging only 3 feet in height and weighing about 60 pounds. They are outgoing but not unusually brave, seeking treasure as a way of gaining the comforts of home which they so dearly love.<br/><br/>SPECIAL ABILITIES: Halflings have better saving throws than most other character classes. They are very accurate with all missile weapons and gain a bonus of + 1 , in addition to Dexterity adjustments, on their " to hit" rolls when using them. Due to their small size and skills at dodging, halflings have a bonus of -2 on their Armor Class when being attacked by creatures larger than man-sized. When rolling for individual initiative (an Optional rule) halflings add +1, in addition to any Dexterity adjustments. Outdoors, halflings are difficult to spot, having the ability to seemingly vanish into woods or underbrush. Halflings have only a 10% chance of being detected in this type of cover, and even in dungeons there is a one-third chance (a roll of 1 or 2 on 1d6) that a halfling will not be seen in normal light if the character finds some cover (such as shadows), and remains absolutely quiet and still.\u201d<br/><br/>So I\u2019d like to combine the two. Adding some magical abilities, but also keeping close to the source material. Is it a thief/magic-user (illusionist) sub-class? I\u2019m not sure that the variations of the Leprechauns do that (AD&amp;D Monster Manual, Dragon Magazine articles, and so on).<br/><br/>Very interested to hear your responses                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469008/#Comment_469008" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-18T10:47:34+00:00" title="January 18, 2018 10:47AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, that's my idea!<br/><br/>To be specific, my historical-fantasy D&amp;D has been running for years on the notion that halflings are half-fae who mature into leprechauns (fae proletariat, if you will) over time. Works well. The way I do it is with feats and prestige classes and such, not really directly applicable to Basic.<br/><br/>One way to keep close to the Basic D&amp;D chassis would be to look at how Mentzer treats prestige classes for e.g. fighters and such and do the same with halflings: keep the class the same at low levels, but when the halfling gets to name level, give them new options. Their magic comes up only then, in other words. Unfortunately this conflicts some with the notion that demihumans are level-capped, if you do that. (Plus, who gets to name level, really.)<br/><br/>Alternatively, if you want them to be magical right from the start, I suggest treating them as a thief/magic-user multiclass in a way parallel to the elf: slow xp progression (sum up the 2nd level limits for thief and MU and go from there), and give them the abilities of both thieves and magic-users. Flavour to taste, so perhaps they get the traditional halfling skills instead of the thief stuff, and perhaps their spell lists are more fae than usual, and maybe they don't use spellbooks, and so on (although if you do that sort of thing, then I think elves should get that treatment as well - I do that anyway with elves, I prefer their magic having subtle differences compared to human arcanists).<br/><br/>Yes, that's probably what I'd do in a relatively conservative Moldway context: just like the elf is a fighter/MU multiclass, have the halfling be a thief/MU multiclass. The parallel pleases me in many ways. If I did this, I would probably just give the dwarf clerical powers to make it a fighter/cleric multiclass, because why not [grin].<br/><br/>You could also keep the traditional halfling and offer the magic-using variant side by side with the magic-less one. If I did this, I would probably make a single-class elf to accompany the spread, too, and so on and so forth...<br/><br/>Let's peek at the demihuman multiclass equivalencies table in case you want to run with that:<br/><br/><b>Elf</b> Fighter/MU<br/><b>Halfling</b> Thief/MU<br/><b>Dwarf</b> Fighter/Cleric<br/><br/><b>???</b> Fighter/Thief<br/><b>???</b> Thief/Cleric<br/><b>???</b> MU/Cleric<br/><br/>Who are those three mystery races? Interesting question for setting flavour!<br/><br/>Maybe they're evil races, split away from the divine systematics, yet redeemable by epic questing and playable from the start as exceptional members of their race? Greenskins for Fighter/Thieves, werepeoples (gnolls) for Thief/Clerics? Is there a MU/Cleric race proper, or have all such beings devolved into Aberrations, becoming the Aboleths and Eye Tyrants of the deep, unaware of their divine heritage in the Four Castes...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469009/#Comment_469009" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-18T11:23:21+00:00" title="January 18, 2018 11:23AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Arguably, the Mentzer/Moldvay halflings are already the (slightly tweaked) fighter/thief multiclass, as they get full fighting proficiency (almost: they can't wield large weapons, but they have no AC restrictions, which is much more significant), a great chance of hiding (not exactly the same as thief skills, but comparable) and d6s for hit dice (the mid-point between fighter d8s and thief d4s).<br/><br/>Which makes me think... To make a "magical halfling", I'd start by restricting armor use as a trade-off.<br/><br/>You could give them a full spellcasting progression, d4 HDs and restrict them to daggers and no armor, but keep all of the halflings' racial special abilities - making them into sort-of MU/thief multiclass the way regular halflings are sort-of fighter/thief. Either create an XP table with bigger baseline numbers than a human MU, or keep the halfling XP table and use the cleric spell table rather than the MUs' (which means they only get spells if they survive to 2nd level).<br/><br/>Or, you could just keep the halfling as your baseline, take away their armor (either restrict them to leather, which seems appropriate, or no armor at all, depending on how far you want to go on the next step), then give them a smattering of ad-hoc spell-like abilities at certain levels. Spells like "mending", "ventriloquism" or "faerie fire" sure sound like they fit the leprechaun shtick, while not really making any actual magic user jealous.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi" title="yukamichi"><img alt="yukamichi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nHW6876KEN77F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">yukamichi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469010/#Comment_469010" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-18T11:34:02+00:00" title="January 18, 2018 11:34AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The <b>Tall Tales of the Wee Folk</b> Leprechaun class is a limited caster (spells up to 5th level and uses the special Fairy Spell List from said book), essentially 1 level slowed advancement compared to MUs, at-will Invisible to Mortals, saves as an Elf, no weapon or armor restrictions.<br/><br/>Depending on how fond you are of thief skills and how thiefly you were thinking of making them, the Invisibility to Mortals may give them enough stealthyness that you don't need anything else. But it's definitely more of a caster than anything else, and doesn't have much in common mechanically with the halfling. Even if it's not what you're looking for, the Fairy Spell list from the book might be worth borrowing; it's a nice thematic mix with some entirely new spells thrown in, less "blasty" than the regular MU list.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vgunn" title="vgunn"><img alt="vgunn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vgunn">vgunn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469015/#Comment_469015" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-18T16:21:45+00:00" title="January 18, 2018  4:21PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a> <br/><br/>Yep, Moldvay\u2019s Halfling is basically a fighter/thief.

They may advance to a maximum of 10th level of experience. Leprechauns can use a shillelagh, pikestaff, dagger, or darts for weapons. Leprechauns must have a minimum score of 9 in both Intelligence and Dexterity. Their maximum score in Strength is 12. Cold Iron is poison to leprechauns. The effect isn\u2019t quick-acting, except in combat when\u2014if hit\u2014iron weapons cause +1 additional damage. But long-term contact, or if ingested, with cold iron will slowly and permanently drain a leprechaun\u2019s Hit Points and Ability Scores. In any case, leprechauns will never have any weapons, tools, or items made from iron; they use instead various stones, woods, or non-ferrous metals and alloys (brass, bronze, silver, gold, mithril, etc.). Leprechauns have spellcasting abilities and follow the same table as Magic-Users. However, they are limited to the Fairy-Charms List. Detect Invisible will reveal any Leprechauns within the spell range. Dispel Magic will cause a leprechaun to become visible, however after a round the leprechaun can again turn Invisible to Mortals. Even when a leprechaun is invisible, sometimes possible for mortals to perceive the faintest glimmer in the air\u2014especially at dawn, dusk, or in moonlight.<br/><br/>Special: Leprechauns have better saving throws than most other character classes. They have a natural Armor Class of 7 and due to their small size and skills at dodging, leprechauns have a bonus of -2 on their Armor Class when being attacked by creatures larger than man-sized. When rolling for individual initiative (an Optional rule) leprechauns add +1, in addition to any Dexterity adjustments. Outdoors, leprechauns are difficult to spot, having the ability to seemingly vanish into woods or underbrush. Leprechauns have only a 10% chance of being detected in this type of cover, and even in dungeons there is a one-third chance (a roll of 1 or 2 on 1d6) that a leprechaun will not be seen in normal light if the character finds some cover (such as shadows), and remains absolutely quiet and still. In natural terrain (woods, underbrush, and even caves), they gain surprise on a roll of 1-3 on 1d6. At will, leprechauns can turn Invisible to Mortals, but the special limitation to this ability is that if seen by a mortal, the leprechaun cannot become invisible to that mortal\u2019s eyes until they have looked\u2014however momentarily\u2014elsewhere. All leprechauns have Second Sight, which enables them to see another fairy\u2019s true form, even if the fairy is Invisible to Mortals, polymorphed, or shapechanged. They speak common, elvish, gnomish, and the languages of the fey.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469027">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469027/#Comment_469027" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-18T21:06:19+00:00" title="January 18, 2018  9:06PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seems good to me, frankly - I'd have no objections to any of that.

They are well-dressed wee folk who have an unrestrained greed for gold. Most \u2018Big Folk\u2019 see Pints as diminutive rogues who cannot be trusted and will deceive whenever possible. They are carousing, capricious fey whose shenanigans might delight you one day and kill you the next if you displease them. <br/><br/>Pints have a fondness of drinking beer, wine, and whiskey (this is how they came about their nickname). But love moonshine with a passion. Legends say that if you capture a Pint you can barter their freedom for their treasure or by them granting you three wishes. Pints hide away their treasure the end of the rainbow (usually a pot of gold hidden in the hollow of a Fairy Tree).<br/><br/><b>Reality:</b> Around three-feet tall, Pints most often wear green or red pants buckled at the knee with a matching coat and shoes with silver buckles on the tops. Sometimes they wear a pointed cap or jaunty hat (adorned with a shamrock), and may be smoking a pipe. There are female Pints, although they seem to be quite few in number. <br/><br/>Pints are agreeable, elusive, and quick-witted. They have fantastically good memories, but they tend to harbor grievances. Pints, while in their youth, on occasion will go trooping in search of treasure. Older Pints usually become cobblers or tailors\u2014having long given up their wandering ways. Most often, they make shoes and clothing for fairies. But sometimes will seek out to mend shoes or clothes for kind Mortals. Pints are excellent musicians, playing the fiddle, harp, and tin whistles, while having wild revelries in the moonlight where many fairies gather to dance, sing and drink. <br/><br/><b>Base XP:</b> 2,000<br/><b>Max Level:</b> 10<br/><b>HD: </b>1d4<br/><b>Attack:</b> As thief<br/><b>Saves:</b> As dwarf<br/><b>Prime:</b> Int, Dex<br/><b>Min Scores:</b> Int 9, Dex 9<br/><b>Max Score:</b> Str 12<br/><b>XP bonus:</b> +5% XP if Dex 13+, +10% XP if Dex 16+<br/><b>Armor:</b> Clothing Only -2 (AC 7 for natural armor)<br/><b>Weapons:</b> Shillelagh (1d6), pikestaff (1d6), dagger (1d4), or darts (1d4)<br/><br/><b>Restrictions:</b> Pints use four-sided dice (d4) to determine their Hit Points. They may advance to a maximum of 10th level of experience. Pints can use a shillelagh, pikestaff, dagger, or darts for weapons. Pints must have a minimum score of 9 in both Intelligence and Dexterity. Their maximum score in Strength is 12. Cold iron is poison to Pints.The effect isn\u2019t instant, except in combat when\u2014if hit\u2014cold iron weapons cause +1 additional damage. But extended contact, or if ingested, with cold iron will slowly and permanently drain a Pint\u2019s Hit Points and Ability Scores (and eventually death). In any case, Pints will never have any weapons, tools, or items made from cold iron; they use instead various stones, woods, or non-ferrous metals and alloys (brass, bronze, silver, gold, mithril, etc.). Pints have spellcasting abilities (no spellbook required) and follow the same table as Magic-Users. However, they are limited to the Fairy-Charms List. <i>Detect Invisible </i>will reveal any Pints within the spell range. <i>Dispel Magic</i> will cause a Pint to become visible, however after a round the Pint can again turn <i>Invisible to Mortals</i>. Even when a Pint is invisible, sometimes possible for mortals to perceive the faintest glimmer in the air\u2014especially at dawn, dusk, or in moonlight.<br/><br/><b>Special:</b> Pints have better Saving Throws than most other character classes. They have a natural Armor Class of 7 and due to their small size and skills at dodging, Pints have a bonus Armor Class of -2 when being attacked by creatures larger than man-sized. When rolling for individual initiative (an Optional rule) Pints add +1, in addition to any Dexterity adjustments. Outdoors, Pints are difficult to spot, having the ability to seemingly vanish into woods or underbrush. Pints have only a 10% chance of being detected in this type of cover, and even in dungeons there is a one-third chance (a roll of 1 or 2 on 1d6) that a Pint will not be seen in normal light if the character finds some cover (such as shadows), and remains absolutely quiet and still. In natural terrain (woods, underbrush, and even caves), they gain surprise on a roll of 1-3 on 1d6. At will, Pints can turn <i>Invisible to Mortals</i>, but the special limitation to this ability is that if seen by a mortal, the Pint cannot become invisible to that mortal\u2019s eyes until they have looked\u2014however momentarily\u2014elsewhere. All Pints have <i>Second Sight</i>, which enables them to see another fairy\u2019s true form, even if the fairy is <i>Invisible to Mortals</i>, <i>polymorphed</i>, or <i>shapechanged</i>. They speak Babel (common), Elvish, Gnomish, and some Fey languages.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469051/#Comment_469051" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-19T11:30:54+00:00" title="January 19, 2018 11:30AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Had to post this.

Why would an invisibility-capable critter maintain the culture and practice of stealth, anyway? (Obviously they're tactically cumulative, but still: D&amp;D doesn't usually stylize this sort of stuff with redundant layers of defenses that require multiple saving roll equivalents to bypass.)<br/><br/>Aside from that, the way to fix the invisibility being overpowered is to make it something that is only available from third level (or other mid-level breakpoint you like) on. That way the class has something big to look forward to, and access doesn't feel cheap. The main issue with strong class abilities at 1st level is that the character becomes a delivery system for the ability. "Hey, we need to hire another halfling to be invisible for us, our tactics all revolve around that single trick. Fortunately players get to generate as many as they want, so we'll always have one."<br/><br/>Obviously it would be natural to have the stealth abilities too if invisibility was something that you only got at 3rd level. Lower-level halflings rely on stealth, while higher level ones have real invisibility. You could even formalize the idea of them being overlapping abilities by saying that you lose the stealth when you gain the invisibility - real 3rd level leprechauns are loud and prideful asshats, they're more likely to fuck your shit up in broad daylight while being invisible than to hide in bushes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469061/#Comment_469061" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-19T17:43:57+00:00" title="January 19, 2018  5:43PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Depending on how B/X-y you want the invisibility power you could put it on the same scale as the wilderness evasion encounter table.<br/><br/>1 in 6 at first level and then scale up depending on level.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469067/#Comment_469067" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-19T18:33:31+00:00" title="January 19, 2018  6:33PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>"Hey, we need to hire another halfling to be invisible for us, our tactics all revolve around that single trick.

(It could be interesting to use Maximums instead of Minimums, for a change; either way, the rarity of the class is achieved.)<br/><br/>Using it as a "prestige class" is another idea I believe you've used - you have to achieve something in the game before you get the option to play this type of character.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469068/#Comment_469068" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-19T18:42:54+00:00" title="January 19, 2018  6:42PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In a Basic context, though - is your Basic even the sort of campaign where rare classes exist, or do you fall back on the Basic Seven (four human classes + three demihumans)? Does the chargen process allow you to trade stat points or such to achieve whichever class you want to play?<br/><br/>I think that it's a big step for Basic D&amp;D when e.g. Mentzer introduces a Monk class or Gygax introduces a Barbarian class; now the world's wide open, there are all sorts of weird classes one might imagine. Some may be rare, some may be more common, but likely none are as common as the four basic human classes. If there's a fifth class (or fourth demihuman class), why not a sixth? Seventh? The doors are open for the concept.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if you're just replacing the Halfling with a slightly different halfling, it's not a given that you'd want to make it a super-prestigious rare class. After all, you're operating on a Basic Seven paradigm here; do you really want to narrow it down further? Are some classes in the constrained framework more difficult get than others?<br/><br/>I don't know, this sort of symbolic systematics cloud castle building isn't useful for all campaign constructions.

That's straightforward enough, and I don't think that the feasibility of the invisibility really hinges off that any more than a cleric's turning ability does on the rarity of undead. If one is bothersome and intrusive, then so is the other.<br/><br/>In my historical campaign goblinoids are human (as in, literally just some ethnically different humans), orcs are demonic, while trolls, kobolds and gnolls are fey (plus both goblinoids and orcs have fey equivalents as various troll sub-races)... this stuff can go any which way when you start playing with the lego pieces. No way to tell in a setting-agnostic way what something like "fey" or "undead" is even going to mean. I mean, ghouls are often not even undead in this campaign. You can't trust in anything.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
