Has anyone else taken it for a spin yet, I'm quite curious about how the system worked for you?<br/><br/>Right now my game group is down to just two players, me and a close friend. The others have real life issues that are keeping them from the game. Since Untitled works best with 4, 6 or 8 players (just going by Aspects matching), I don't foresee getting to play it anytime soon.<br/><br/>If you have play experience I have a couple of questions for you. By the way, does anyone know how to get a hold of Keith? His forum at The Forge is inactive, and the forum at his own Web site is down.<br/><br/>If you're interested in learning more about Untitled, I created <a href="http://erdtman.com/holken/untitled/" rel="nofollow"><b>a system reference for the game</b></a> and compiled a small FAQ. Perhaps it will help someone else play the game.<br/><br/>TTFN,<br/><br/>Yoki                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tyler" title="Tyler"><img alt="Tyler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tyler">Tyler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99339/#Comment_99339" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-26T15:56:57+00:00" title="September 26, 2007  3:56PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, but I'd really love to.  Beyond a game, its a really awesome artifact of play.  Is it easy to understand how to play just from the text?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
