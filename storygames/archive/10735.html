Just telling players "Agree on a 1-10 rating for your gonzoness" wouldn't work.<br/><br/>So I'm actually creating a formalized <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3724" rel="nofollow">Gonzometer</a> for Do. Actually, it just packages up some old ideas in the game and gives them a catchy name.

I have real difficulties with it.<br/><br/>Sometimes, I like playing in a big, epic style: I remember a Shab Al-Hiri Roach game that ended with armies clashing in the fields of the university. It's really sad when that gets dismissed as "gonzo". It can be epic, without dealing with Heavy Issues, and not be "gonzo". (This links in with what you say about it being a perjorative word.)<br/><br/>I like your delineation of different ways to play. I'm not sure about all of the labels. Games of Misery Bubblegum can be small-scope and heavy, but they don't feel like melodrama. Jack Vance's Dying Earth stories are big and light, but you lose so much if you describe them as gonzo.<br/><br/>So, yes.

It's about going native and taking things to their fullest extreme.<br/><br/>It tends to happen in games with fewer constraints on creativity, especially those in which narrative control is distributed. It can happen in Mortal Coil or Cold City, although it tends not too (unless Joshua is playing), it happens more often in octaNe or inSpectres because that's the kind of thing Jared encourages in those games. For some reason, it didn't happen in Lacuna, presumably because the tone is very strong and guides creativity more than in those other games.<br/><br/>It doesn't happen in Dying Earth because the language of the game serves as a filter to constrain creativity to certain kinds of thing.<br/><br/>It pretty much happened in a game of Misery Bubblegum that we played in a pub, but it was the last scene and was brought on by a player who hadn't been there for much of the game and by the fact that I hadn't handled the set-up properly. And it really didn't feel right. MB has strong creative constraints set up at the start.

I love these sorts of x/y plots.<br/><br/>I see the point people are making, though, about things that are big-and-light but not gonzo. The distinction might be between "light" as a <i>mood</i> vs. a <i>play style</i> \u2014 to me, the problematic "gonzo" or "silly" breakdown of collaborative storytelling comes when people stop caring about the dramatic structure of the story and the consistency of its world, in favor of easy lolz.<br/><br/>So for example, the Dying Earth stories, or even "Time Bandits", are funny but still have a dramatic structure and sufficient internal consistency to keep the narrative intact. A typical episode of "Monty Python's Flying Circus" didn't have that, and often actively attacked those concepts; but Monty Python only worked because the writing and acting were so good. In the hands of everyday gamers improvising without a net, that lack of structure or consistency fall flat.<br/><br/>I hate to introduce a third axis, but maybe this is one \u2014\xa0dramatic/anti-dramatic or consistent/inconsistent or something like that:<br/><br/>Light + Big + Dramatic = Time Bandits, The Dying Earth, Discworld<br/>Light + Big + Anti-dramatic = Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy, Catch-22, Gravity's Rainbow<br/>Heavy + Big + Dramatic = Opera<br/>Heavy + Big + Anti-Dramatic = 20th-century existential/surrealist/postmodern fiction (Kafka, Camus, later Delany)<br/>Light + Small + Dramatic = Sitcom<br/>Light + Small + Anti-Dramatic = Monty Python's Flying Circus<br/>Heavy + Small + Dramatic = Melodrama<br/>Heavy + Small + Anti-Dramatic = Waiting For Godot                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bryant" title="Bryant"><img alt="Bryant" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bryant">Bryant</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238140/#Comment_238140" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-19T08:38:07+00:00" title="October 19, 2009  8:38AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not a big fan of "gonzo" as a synonym for "silly" but I think that's probably a losing battle at this point.

What I ended up doing was "baking" tone into other aspects of the game--Toggles one switches on which, in turn, prevent or allow certain abilities.<br/><br/>The point being that "mechanically induced" tone comes easier, I find, than mere consensus. Maybe an example:<br/>* I had a "Dark" Tone as a consensus option (or, more likely, Organizer dictate). It was intended to allow for horror or "dark' genres (e.g. dark fantasy).<br/>* The more I looked at what MAKES those genres dark, the more I realized it had a lot to do with (a) constrained efficacy of PCs or (b) the verisimilitude of threats to life and limb.<br/>* So I finally stripped Tone as a concept in the game, instead making Power Level a form of tone control (i.e. efficacy, limitations on resources) and created World priority (i.e. you can die from anything that kills you when bound or unconscious) as opposed to Player Priority (i.e. you can only die if you CHOOSE to take that risk, for a temporary buff).<br/>:: If one wants a "dark" game, one dials down Power Level and makes it World Priority. For even darker, toggle to No Resurrect.<br/><br/>And the best take-away was that I had FAR more axes for tuning general levity (usually a factor of no fear as a result of extreme confidence, at least in LARPs), "heroicness" or desperation, reward levels and types (and, thus, different levers of motivation), and other minor elements (mainly to deal with power-level disparity). Perhaps such thinking would work for you, if you can find mechanical "controls" in Do's system?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/boulet" title="boulet"><img alt="boulet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/534/nTWF4B3HT5CT6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/boulet">boulet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238380/#Comment_238380" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-20T11:32:57+00:00" title="October 20, 2009 11:32AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>What does gonzo mean to you? </i>I've been reading about gonzo for a few years on RPG boards and I must say I feel almost the same as the first time I wondered "what do they mean by gonzo?". The more I read about it, the vaguer it gets. I guess it's a case of "you know one when you see one" Warning from a Frenchie: this is a difficult concept to translate, if you plan on getting your game translated please save a few headaches to the translator, avoid the use of "gonzo". <br/><br/><i>What is good about gonzo? </i>Those who love it are really excited by the collision (of what I'm not sure), like good fireworks or something. If I measure the quality of gonzo to the intensity of online posts about it, it must be friggin' good.<br/><br/><i>Why does gonzo get a bad rap? </i>Among those who hate it, genre perversion and verisimilitude mauling seem to be the typical accusations.

If envoking a Trait drives the narrative, then silly traits will make goofy narrative; somber traits, dark narrative; etc. Just a thought... mainly I think it will be tough to just say, "OK, no Monty Python jokes" and start. (Universalis Tenets are similar--but they provide a mechanical hook in terms of Challenge dice when someone violates a Tenet to narrate... or even to take a phone call!)<br/><br/>If you're going to go with declaration-by-consensus, then at least have a Stick that can be wielded if someone breaks the consensus.

Now its <i>possible</i> that there's enough of a lead to justify that scene in a way that would merely make me wince rather than walk away in disgust...but not likely.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow...if that were a scene from say...season three of the Last Airbender, flashing back to the Fire Nation Assault on the Air Temples and those were Wind Bison being ridden by Air Benders taking out a Fire Nation ship...that wouldn't bother me much at all.  Because those sorts of capabilities have been well and truly established in the show as being reasonable for that world.<br/>\n<br/>\nFurther, is HOW those capabilities were introduced.  Avatar did an outstanding job of introducing pieces of the world bit by bit in a way that continuously built on what came before.  Every now and then there'd be a "didn't see that one coming" moment, but it almost always had sufficient precedent that it didn't feel jarring.  How much is revealed all at once suddenly...is as important as what is revealed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were a couple of unreasonable moments in Avatar...like pulling down 30 foot thick ice walls with a giant harpoon gun mounted on a ship...which strangely wasn't pulled towards the wall at all.  And wooden submarines that didn't leak.  But those mostly fall into the category of minor gaffs rather than gonzo.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd "are you seeing what I'm seeing?" is a great format for a veto (and make no mistake that's what it is).  What are you envisioning as being the procedure when someone says "no"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238438/#Comment_238438" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-20T14:48:20+00:00" title="October 20, 2009  2:48PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 20, 2009 2:49PM by DanielSolis.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oooh!

See, the setting is presented in several letters written by people asking the Pilgrims for help. Each letter comes from a different world, which have very wide variance in their respective gonzocity.

That's partly because I didn't impose many constraints when I asked people for submissions, but I've got no regrets about that.<br><br>The trick is that players choose the letters they want to answer at the beginning of the whole pilgrimage. That's a point where players can make sure the letters (and worlds) are internally consistent with each other. They can make sure they follow a theme throughout, like <i>only</i> choosing letters that have robots and avoiding any mysticism.

It also perverts genre*. This means that if you're playing hard-boiled noir cop drama... and you have a dude named The Mutt who has a trained army of attack dogs that he sends out as assassins to track down his rivals and kill them... not only does it distance us from reality (less genuine, less sincere, harder to play close to home), it also distances us from the essence of hard-boiled noir drama (damaging our tropes, damaging tone and coherency, making for inconsistent expectations, damaging trust).<br/><br/>It's possible to use absurd/over-the-top/curveball imagery and situations and events to genuinely address themes/characters/situations/whatever. It's not gonzo to have pterodactyls in New York, necessarily. When you fail to be genuine to the fiction (and the SIS), then it hedges towards gonzo.

That really helps. In regards to: "Additional details will not alter my perception of the scene in either direction." I am seeing (one of) the deal-breakers.

Is that beyond the point where you'd even be interested in the story at all?</blockquote>\nAs mentioned previously, context and setting is the key. Batman's setting is nominally real-world, with a small number of fairly low-level deviations. Mystical elements are typically very local in scale and scope, and super-tech is typically an incremental improvement over real tech. So, I evaluate the image from that context. In that context, it's ghastly, because an ape is objectively worse at everything involved in the task presented compared to a human (with the possible exception of grip strength) and the dinosaurs don't even exist at all. Then you get to the usage of these elements, and the context of semi-real-world physics makes me twitch (of course, I only think of real-world physics because I'm disengaging from the shock of the rest of it).<br/><br/>Regarding the deal-breaker issue, yeah. For example, a retcon isn't going to help if I've already disengaged, and I'd just as likely interpret it as more nonsense - now you've abandoned both sense and narrative reliability! In other words, no charity is left in my readings. It's all nonsense from here. The old Scooby Doo cartoons are only interesting when you're too young to get the formula and notice how shallow it is. At our age, it's nostalgia and kitsch, not genuinely compelling plot and story. You can pull the mask of the Gonzo Ghost and reveal Old Man Mundane once and only once, and after that every new Gonzo Ghost is just another rubber mask that I should rightfully ignore or just shoot in the face before it really does kill Dafney with that goddamn cleaver. <br/><br/>Sorry. Anyway.<br/><br/>Let's shift context. Suppose the context of that picture is "Planet of the Apes." Now I expect the apes to be intelligent demi-humans, which means yeah, steal that boat. But while riding dinosaurs? Really?<br/><br/>Okay, now you do some kind of Dinotopia thing, with a fantasy-ish world and people coexisting with intelligent dinosaurs and employing them in improbable ways. You give me time to get used to that. Then you introduce the gorilla-folk. Let that simmer for a while. Then you can have gorilla-folk on their devious airborne allies attack the admiral. Alliteratively. But you've got to establish that slowly. I've got to believe at least most of the pieces before I buy the whole thing together. <br/><br/>Also, Ralph, yeah, Avatar is a great example of gradual introductions and world-building.

If your contribution fits the precedents, you'll be okay. If it doesn't, then it'll cost you to add it.

This same street vigilante spends his weekends in a secret clubhouse on the moon with Space Moses, an Amazon fashioned from clay, the last Martian, the King of Atlantis and a space cop with a magic wish-ring.

Or the time he took over the empire of an Arabic stand-in for Dr. Fu Manchu, married the overlord's daughter and fathered a son?  To my memory, the most urban and street level Batman has been was during No Man's Land when Gotham City devolved to tribal law with warring factions of criminals, ex-cops, costumed vigilantes and regular citizens; but it took a gigantic earthquake knocking the city over and the US government declaring it non US soil to get there.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow much fun would it be if, as part of the ongoing campaign, you had a faction that was spending the currency to make the story more wild while you had a semi-opposing faction spending currency to bring it more down to earth?

Even if everybody in the story is taking it deadly seriously, the players are laughing and having a big silly time so that makes good sense to me!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238749/#Comment_238749" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-22T11:07:50+00:00" title="October 22, 2009 11:07AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 22, 2009 11:08AM by Brian_Minter.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DanielSolis</cite>Thanks!

Myth and Epic both work, but Epic has a lot of baggage. I think I'll go with Myth for now.<br/><br/>So... here's a crazy idea: What if the Gonzometer was a compass, but still held true as a measure of gonzocity? The further north you go, the bigger the problems get. The further east you go, the sillier the problems get.
