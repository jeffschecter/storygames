                    Okay, show of hands!  How many people came in because the topic line convinced them that I was going to say something you really, really disagree with?<br/><br/>Well, let's see:  Misery Bubblegum creates characters for each session, so I've been present for the creation of <b>a lot</b> of characters recently.  We usually latch on to the conflict cards, so the characters are defined by stuff like "Why can't I stick up for myself?" and "You don't love me" and the like.  It is easy to make such a character ... we've all practiced the skills of it.  And certainly they're easy to play.  Drive straight the hell at the conflicts, beat the shit out of the character, resolve what you can (often everything) and you're done.<br/><br/>But there's the point ... when you do that, you're genuinely done.  Those conflicts that defined the character?  All gone.  Burned up.<br/><br/>This isn't new insight.  <i>Sorceror</i> said it way back when.  When the character's Kicker is resolved they're no longer a playable character.  They can become a playable character if you give them another Kicker ... if you inject more conflict.  Now I agree with that.  A character without conflict is not a playable thing.<br/><br/>Everyone with me so far?<br/><br/>Having played session of Misery Bubblegum, <i>every single session</i> ends with us saying "Oh wow, we could totally play these characters again, just by grabbing some new conflicts."  But we don't, and at the end of the last session I said to people "Y'know, we should consciously try to do that.  We should make characters with the <i>intent</i> of playing them through multiple sessions."<br/><br/>So I've been wondering what would be different about doing that, and I think that it would mean a focus on the stuff outside of conflict ... the things about the character that don't get burned to a crisp through the course of play.  A smile that lights up the room.  Shallow vanity that makes a charming counterpoint to the humility of another character.  Metal claws that go "snikt!" as they spring out of the back of his hands.<br/><br/>When you start adding elements that just plain make you happy to be playing the character, even though they don't drive conflict, then I think you construct a character that you're going to like no matter what conflict gets layered on them.  Now, as I said above, that character <i>absent conflict</i> is unplayable.  You can't just sit around making "snikt" noises all session long and expect to have fun.  It's <b>boring</b>.  But bringing those happy-making elements into your conflicts improves the conflicts.<br/><br/>I'm starting to ramble.  Dictionary of Mu has this character "Kid with a Rock."  He's a Kid.  He has a Rock.  That is <b>so cool</b>.  Amidst all these prophets and witch-kings he's a kid with a big rock.  That's the happy-making thing about that character, for me.  You could wrap that in <b>any</b> type of conflict, and I'd be interested.  He's lost his water-skin?  Cool.  What's a kid with a rock do about that?  He sees a young girl and falls in love with her?  Cool.  What's a kid with a rock do about that?<br/><br/>So that's what I think Misery Bubblegum needs now ... some guidance (which, as the guidance gets more reliable and more objective, becomes rules and mechanics) for how to do this one thing right.  How do you make the bits of the character that aren't there to drive the story, but rather are there to reward you for driving the story by making you happy with the character?<br/><br/><br/><br/>NOTE:  I suspect that this is what people have been trying to get at in past conversations with me when they said things like "If you're just driving to the conflict you never get a chance to really sit back and learn who the character is," and the like.  Many gamers "discover" (by which I mean that they invent, but they invent in an incremental process that seems like discovery) the things about their character that make them happy through the process of play, and that process can be interfered with by a focus on conflict.  It would be appropriate for anyone who has had those conversations with me to take this time to say "I told you so," and I will totally cop to that, so long as you aren't strident about it.  If you're strident I'll blow you off, even though you're right :-)                </div>

                            Tony.  This post made me want to shout "FUCK YEAH!" in the manner of the "Team America: World Police" theme tune.<br/><br/>I'm totally with you man.  This is one of those posts where I realise that this is what I've been scrabbling towards, but unable to realise or articulate for so long.<br/><br/>I just want you to know that I have copied and pasted this into my notes for my current game project. (whether I'll be able to use it, or whether I'll look at it later and just go "huh..." and discard it is another matter.  But it really clicked for me right now <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> )<br/><br/>Thank you.                        </div>

                            Your post makes me think of two separate ways that could make characters more interesting in the long term.  The first is juxtaposition, the second is long term questions.<br/><br/>By juxtaposition, I mean taking two ideas and putting them together.  Like the Kid with a Rock.  You have Kid, you have Rock, how do they work together?  This is used for stories ("it's like Die Hard meets Blade Runner") and characters ("she's a high school student by day, and fights zombies at night!").  Many traditional games use this ("this is my dwarven wizard" or "my vampire is a member of Clan Tramps and the Order of Blood Suckers Against Other Blood Suckers"), although I think that Pace did it very well (as I hear that Trollbabe did, but I haven't looked at it).  It literally creates two dimensional characters, but add in the conflicts and you have at least three dimensions of characters.<br/><br/>The second point that your post brought up was if characters are done when their conflicts are done, make some conflicts last longer.  This seems a bit soap opera-ish if taken to an extreme ("will Johnny ever learn that Doc Ottis is his father... and his brother?").  Taking a page from PTA, you can create character arcs around these longer conflicts and have them work like ticking time bombs ("five more sessions until I have to face the Black Knight?  shit he's going to run me over without blinking still") so they don't just go on forever.  Or have them go on forever.<br/><br/>Three, ok I've thought of three ways.  A third way is to have the characters stay basically the same after each game.  Those wacky guys in the A-Team never changed (BA NEVER liked flying or stopped pittying the fool, why do we need change?)                        </div>

                            Aaron:  Yeah, I think I'm trying to get at the bits that don't need to change, but are important <i>anyway</i>.<br/><br/>Here's the question I'm mulling over right now, trying to decide whether it's the right one to separate out the proper ingredients:  "On your character's best day, when he has nothing but good luck and wins a pure victory with no sadness or cost, who is he?"<br/><br/>And I shall now pick three classic angst puppies to use as examples.<br/><br/>On that day, Spiderman is humble.  He is funny.  He lives up to his responsibilities.  Every square inch of New York City is his personal play-ground, to swing and bound and joke.  He is our friendly neighbor.<br/><br/>On that day, Buffy is sweet.  She knows what is right.  She is boundlessly strong.  She brings people together.  She is the friend who makes us all friends.<br/><br/>On that day, Luke Skywalker knows he can make a difference.  He believes in something bigger than himself.  He is trusting.  He is open.  He needs our help, and we become better people so that we can give it to him.<br/><br/>I think this is why these characters keep drawing us back, even after their first stories are done.  If you say "Spiderman's in trouble!" then I want to know how it turns out, without knowing a single word more.                        </div>

                            Hey, Tony --<br/><br/>My experience with previous characters is that this stuff comes up out of play.<br/><br/>So we're playing, and we do some little bit of color that's awesome.  And, because we know that this character is going to keep going, we look at that and go "hey, I wonder if that's a <i>thing</i>" and file it away for future reference.<br/><br/>So we don't sit down knowing that Spider-man is humble, jokey, what have you.

                            Since the only thing I can think about these days is <em>FLFS</em>, here's how I do it there: loosely speaking, your character's conflicts are set up in your three thematic batteries.  That's what the GM will engineer the situation off of, that's what each game will revolve around.  You can swap out one thematic battery at the end of each situation.  On the other hand, the rest of your sheet is filled with "attributes" and "skills" which are sneaky.  They look like regular old atts-n-skills, but they're actually flags for how you want problems to be resolved.  You don't swap those, but you do build them up as you go.  So I'll encode those "on his best day" traits into his atts and skills (the friendly guy gets high Savoir-Faire and Acquaintances, the supercool pilot guy gets Shiphandling and Gunnery, etc).  Those will always be around.  The things that he does with those evergreen traits, though, all orbit around his thematic batteries.  So I can be Proving Myself with my Savoir-Faire and Acquaintances, I can be dealing with being Blackmailed, or I can be overcoming my reputation as a Prissy Socialite.                        </div>

                            Josh, <br/><br/>I hear you have this game coming out soon, but I can't remember what it's called?<br/><br/>Tony,<br/><br/>On some levels, I think part of this is the result of eliding all conflict into a card associated with a single character.  Now, I recognize what I'm about to suggest is tantamount to "throw everything away and start over," but it strikes me that conflict is the interaction between what would be static traits in isolation.  <br/><br/>Buffy is the friend who makes us friends.  Okay, how does that play to Willow's self doubt?  Also important: how does that play with her feeling of duty to protect?  <br/><br/>And of course, in Spiderman you imply how conflicts change traits: Petey's happy-go-lucky, stay outta trouble, until the criminal he lets escape kills his gentle Uncle Ben.<br/><br/>"Why don't you love me?" is the possible product of dozens of traits, most obvious being "I need to be loved," and "Attractive but aloof."

                            I'm going to propose something I'm not entirely sure is true, but whatever...<br/><br/>I think that the things we find evergreen cool (as Josh put it) are the things that we deeply sympathise with, or at least the things we sympathise with at one remove.  And I think this is true of character traits in any form of media, even static ones like movies and books and stuff.  Examples!<br/><br/>I'm involved in a complex game.  It's <i>Exalted</i>, set in modern day San Fransisco, using the mechanics from <i>HeroQuest</i>.  I'm playing Katarina, a talented ballerina who teaches womens' self defense classes recently exalted.  And a couple of sessions in, I discover something interesting/important/compelling about her: She's very protective.  She's like a big sister, always looking out for everyone in emotional and physical arenas.<br/><br/>And you know what?  That's an ideal I'm highly sympathetic to.  One that I tend to aspire to myself (which isn't always a good thing).  This is a compelling trait because it is a trait about me as a person not just a trait about some bit of fiction.<br/><br/>Batman is a character I tend to find very compelling.  What do I find compelling?  His intense drive, his incredible competence, but most of all his tendency to have plans for any contingency.  And why is that compelling?  Because I'm a control freak.  The ideal of never being caught by surprise, never being in a position where you don't have a solution worked out is personally appealing (even if it's also creepy).<br/><br/>So, I think that the things we find compelling in characters like this are the same things that we find compelling <i>in ourselves</i>.  They're ideals we aspire to personally.  They're evergreen because they are how we explore ourselves.<br/><br/>The problem is that I'm not sure the connection is as close as I think it is, and further I don't know how to provide guidelines for this sort of thing.  How do you help people to figure out what's compelling in themselves so that they can project that onto a character?<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            The fundamental nature of the thing?  Just as you said, right?  This thing that your character does which isn't really a conflict, but is just enjoyable.<br/><br/>Let me think of an example.<br/><br/>Okay, so I played this cyberpunk character once who was a techie for a police department.  One of the other characters was a lieutenant in charge of me, and he kept trying to get my to design gadgetry for him.  Invariably, either I would screw up the design or the building or he would screw up in the use, and he would end up fall from a very, very, very large height.  It didn't matter what the gadget was, or what it was intended to do, it would end up the same.<br/><br/>(this started out as some die rolls.)<br/><br/>Anyway, so this lieutenant character.  It rapidly became apparent that falling was *his thing*  It wasn't really a conflict. We never resolved it.  He just ... ended up in freefall whenever we could interpret the dice.<br/><br/>Is that what you're thinking of?  Helpful?<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>

At the risk of derailing the thread, I did want to bring this up real quick.  I think one of the tricks involved in making us care about characters is to have chances to see them happy.  Would I watch an entire movie about Spiderman being happy and all that?  Maybe.  Would I watch two or three?  Probably not.  As you say, that'd be boring.<br/><br/>But in that movie in which Spiderman gets slammed over and over again into agonizing problems, I want to see glimpses of who he is when it's not so bad.  I want to see it shown that, you know what?  He's <i>right</i>.  Maybe it's hard for him to keep his happy attitude and care about people, but then we get to see him in a quiet moment with MJ, or talking to Aunt May, and we go 'Aha!  This is what it's all about!'.  I think that the scenes of quiet reflection and happiness (or whatever) can make the conflicts all that much more powerful.<br/><br/>Of course I'm not really sure how to pace those any more than I know how to accurately pick out important features for characters.  You want enough happy stuff to drive home what's at stake, but you don't want so much that you're bored.<br/><br/>EDIT: Cross-posted with Ben.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            Thomas is absolutely right, and it took me a while to see this in my gaming and design.  It's a direct development of show-don't-tell.  In order for the conflict to have any meaning, it must have a context, and in order to get the audience/players to hook into that context, it needs to be expressed in-game.  Knowing that the character had some happy times or that there was a happy ending isn't really enough: you need to <em>play</em> those things, if even for a heartbeat.                        </div>

No- my characters are usually exploration-focused with lots of built in curiosities since I'm much more interested in the setting, details, and topic of the game than in the evolution of the characters. I don;t mind if conflict is one of the ways of interfacing with the game &amp; character.                        </div>

That's not really what I'm talking about.  It has commonalities, but also differences.<br/><br/>I'm talking about the things that make a character who they are outside of a conflict ... the things that make us want to see <i>this</i> character in a conflict-laden story rather than Generic-Character-X in the same conflict-laden story.                        </div>

                            Tony,<br/><br/>It's a tough question, and anything I say is going to be pretty provisional.  Still, at the moment, I'm thinking it's something to related to choices made when there's no pressure.  When you can do whatever you want, what is it that you do?<br/><br/>This seems to be the case in both of my above examples at least.  The coolest moments of Katarina exhibiting big-sister-ness are not the ones where she's in conflict, but the ones where she's just reacting.  The coolest Batman moments for me aren't the ones where his pre-planning solves a problem, but the ones where it's a throw-away about some minor point that demonstrates that, yes, he thought of that too.<br/><br/>I wonder if it isn't something that very specifically isn't about conflicts.  It's not about how you get what you want (victory in a conflict), but simply how you are.  If this is the case, then it seems that while whatever these things are might help in a conflict, they have to be the sorts of things that get shown/used/whatever outside of conflicts all the time.<br/><br/>Which, unfortunately, doesn't really speak to what it is or how we get it (though it does seem to point to a possible signal of this sort of thing).<br/><br/>I think part of the problem is that, if I'm right that the compelling evergreen features in characters are the things we recognize in ourselves in a direct sense, it's going to require some amount of introspection to pick them out.  I didn't always recognize that I was a control freak, and before I did I wasn't able to point out why I thought Batman was so cool.  Creating the sorts of compelling traits your aiming for seems to require that the players understand themselves and each other in some pretty deep ways.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how to make that happen.  And if the group already understands each other at that level, I'm not sure what mechanics beyond a simple note 'The game is better if you puts pieces of yourself in characters' can do for play.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

<p>It's funny, but your descriptions of Spiderman, Buffy, and Luke to me sound conflict-laden, to me. But the difference between their good days and their bad days is whether that conflict is purely external or reflected internally.</p>
<p>So, although this is probably not what you want to talk about in this thread, I see the solution to long-running play as a setting-wide conflict that can't be resolved. Something that creates small conflicts which the character becomes caught up in (and which occasionally generates internal conflict.) Trollbabe, for example, has a conflict inherent in the setting; character creation doesn't assign any individual conflicts at all, although the process of gaining relationships can tie the trollbabe into the setting conflict.</p>

<p>I don't think it is particularly difficult or surprising to say, "It is good to understand a character's unstressed behavior." I do this all the time, and maybe it's why I get listless and disinterested in all-conflict-all-the-time games, because there is all this <em>stuff</em> about my character that doesn't get play.</p>
<p>I think your 'best day' thing is a good way to get at this, Tony, but maybe it is too extreme. Some people will behave very differently on a really great day than a merely ordinary one, and some characters are the same. What you need to know about is baseline behavior.</p>
<p>I find that HQ implicitly does this pretty well - if you start out with a filled character, then you have a lot of stuff to pull on and through play, internally it becomes clear to you what is baseline and what is stress behavior. For instance in the game Thomas runs, it took maybe two sessions for me to say, "Well, clearly Qaldun is a quietish guy but he gets sort of prolix when he is stressed about Temulun," and "It makes Qaldun uncomfortable to be at odds with someone under his command." That's like great stuff that makes him a more interesting guy all the time.</p>

                            Shreyas:  Yeah, but for M-B I need to get it all humming in the first five minutes.  So the long-term accrual of subconscious understanding just won't work.

Basically, players introduce signifiers and then retroactively incorporate the signified into their understanding of the fiction.  Like, a piece of the character sheet, say, where you list off three random things about the character, and later in play you might elaborate why/how they're there.  My character is wearing a wedding ring.  Later, I can introduce his wife / his wife's death / his ex-fiancee who left him at the altar.                        </div>

I don't know.  There's this tricky (deceptive, really!) tool that I feel can be applied to the problem.<br/><br/>Suppose you've got a player who has just described a bog-standard D&amp;D fighter.  You say "So ... what's the story behind his sword?"<br/><br/>You haven't just asked a question.  You've <i>commissioned a performance</i>.  You are saying, in subtext, "What's the story behind his sword ... and I expect it to be interesting!"<br/><br/>Likewise, if you ask players "So what does your character act like when there's no pressure?" you are commissioning a performance, and (barring blank-page syndrome) they will tell you something that they find interesting.  And, in order to tell something they find interesting, they'll reach inside themselves ... whether they realize it or not.<br/><br/>Honestly, I think blank-page syndrome is the thing to fear.  That happens when you ask the question the wrong way:<br/><br/>"So, where'd your sword come from?"  "Uh ... the sword-shop.  Smithery.  Smithy."<br/><br/>"So, what's the story behind your sword?

The sad result of a tragic childhood accident is that no, no I can't.

On the one hand, maybe?  At the risk of sounding like JBR here, <cite>Full Light Full Steam's</cite> under-represented and awesome scrip mechanic emphasizes recognizing the traits (in the form of thematic batteries) of other characters, so they get incredible emphasis.  <cite>TSoY's</cite> refreshing scenes have the potential to do the moment of reflection thing, which actually works quite well.<br/><br/>On the other hand, maybe conflict's not a whole other thing.  If you consider all of the possible characteristics of a character (eye color, favorite ice cream, etc) I think a criteria for mattering is whether or not they apply to a plot conflict.  Time spent with MJ emphasizes Spidey's love for MJ, so that it matters when the Green Goblin threatens her.                        </div>

                            I'm with Judson, here.  Conflict is still an intrinsic part of the picture.  The thing that we're talking about is the thing that's applied to or referenced by or threatened by the conflicts.  The conflicts come and go, but the other stuff is what sticks around.  But the other stuff is only significant if it consistently gets chewed up by the conflicts.  Otherwise it's the street that Peter Parker lives on, instead of MJ.                        </div>

                            I suspect this is one of those spectrums of preference.  A good deal of fan fiction and other online roleplaying venues does <em>this exact thing</em> over and over and over.  Milliway's Bar, for instance, has characters from every piece of fiction ever conceived, and as far as I'm aware they just sort of hang out.                        </div>

I can almost see saying the same thing: I want to see that, but not all the time.  <br/><br/>Here's why: for me, I find that if MJ's role was just to have pleasant but utterly unrelated conversation with Peter between bouts of web-slinging, I parse that as dead air.  A waste of my time as the audience, a waste of the authors time as an artist.  In an RPG, that's both me, so I'm wasting double time.  Or something.<br/><br/>But the "utterly unrelated" part is the crucial, fragile part.  How can "loves MJ" not be involved in a Spiderman conflict?  Even if it's "I wish I had more time to spend with MJ."  And the time they spend together serves the purpose of underscoring that.  We engage with it, with Spidey being happy, and when something threatens it, the conflict engages us.  <br/><br/>Does that resonate at all?  If not, would you enjoy and recommend a film where the characters are just happy, friendly people without any problems?  Sure, you'd see a Spiderman film like that, but is part of that because you know that Spiderman exists outside of that film?                        </div>

                            Josh,<br/><br/>Real quick for accuracy: You've clearly not spent enough time reading <i>Milliways</i>.  Sure it's full of 'just hanging out', but it's also full of conflict.  But I can imagine a game existing where it's all hanging out and there's no conflict (and it's a boring thing to imagine).<br/><br/>Let me see if I can some at this from a different direction.  Many scenes of conflict, at least in my games, do not start on the conflict.  Maybe it's two characters hanging out at the bar talking, having fun, just interacting.  After some amount of time, when we've had enough fun with that, <i>then</i> the crazy assassins bust down the door.  We don't always start in the bar with the assassins busting down the door.<br/><br/>I think one of the difficulties is that conflict-scenes have pretty clear points where they end.  We can clearly identify that a conflict is over (at least for now) and this is a good place to cut to a new scene.  But how do you know when you've gotten the optimal amount of fun from 'just hanging out' and it's time to either end the scene or send in the assassins?  That's tough for me.<br/><br/>Oh, and I'd be curious to hear if your games are like mine.  Do you have some general character interaction before the assassins bust in sometimes?  Or do you always frame straight to the assassins and the door-kicking?<br/><br/>EDIT: Judson, I'll try to get to your question in a bit.  It's a good one, and not one I have a ready answer for.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

<small>(<em>Full Light, Full Steam</em> regulates scene length by characterization references, which may be one solution to that question, Thomas.)</small><br/><br/>I haven't read much Milliways, no.  But my point stands: in the Hierarchy of Stuff Happening, conflict is pretty low on the scale. Or any number of fan fic pieces where the primary point of writing the thing seems to put two characters with sexual tension between them on a date or analogue.  There isn't much conflict; lots of these are the resolution of conflicts that have been drawn out in the show.                        </div>

You know what, after some thought, I've decided I would enjoy such a film executed properly.  Because I <i>like seeing people happy</i>.  Even if they didn't have to struggle to get there, or at least if we didn't see those struggles, I still like to see happy people.<br/><br/>I think this may be escapist or self-projecting somehow.  I want to see scenes that I would like to participate in.  I mean, sure I love <i>stories</i> about fighting off assassins, but I don't want to actually do it.  On the other hand, I <i>do</i> want to protect my friends and help them when they're going through emotionally trying times.  So I want to see scenes where characters that I am responsible for are protecting their friends and helping them when they're going through emotionally trying times.<br/><br/>Now, I definitely wouldn't want all my movies (or books or whatever), or even most of them, to be conflict-less.  But I do think I would enjoy some small portion of them that way.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            Tony, while I agree with Josh, I think you have a good point: we know the butter of conflict pretty well (although there is a strange one conflict:one scene thing that you've been speaking insightfully to), but we're less clear on the flour of character.  I mean, we buy it from the store, but we don't know how it's made, if that's not stretching the metaphor too far.<br/><br/>And frankly, I want to eat cookies.  What I was pointing at with my little mechanical sketch is that if you don't have cookies at your table, no one wants to start eating.  Conflict without character or vice versa isn't very compelling.  <br/><br/>Make the following amendment to what I suggested: instead of traits being the product of conflict, they have to be established my themselves.  Maybe even charged up in order to contribute to a conflict.  Aha!  And I can work in my personal sawhorse about withholding credibility.  Here we go:<br/><br/>A conflict is at best worth the product of the resources invested in the traits that it arises from.<br/>You can attempt, in free play, to establish or promote your traits.  If other players see it, they invest some of their resources in your trait.<br/>Alternatively, pair two traits into a conflict.  Advancing the conflict reaps some value related to the sum of the resources.  Resolving reaps the product.<br/><br/>Something like that, anyway.  Then you're spending effort just establishing things about your character, and you might establish new traits with an eye towards easily conflicting with traits in play.  <br/><br/>I'm a little afraid that play would tend toward to the broad rather than the subtle.                        </div>

                            The more I think about it, the more I think that involving these traits as stakes in <i>any way whatsoever</i> is a recipe for disaster.<br/><br/>If Peter love MJ, that's cool.  We all like that.<br/><br/>And I am <b>100% fine</b> with stakes like "Can you <i>show</i> your love for MJ?" or "Does MJ love you back?" and all that jazz.  Those are conflicts which are inspired by the love, and which influence the way it is shown in the story, but which in no way affect the existence of the love.<br/><br/>But man ... stakes like "If you lose then Peter doesn't love MJ any more"?  No.  Just <b>no</b>.<br/><br/>Because, on a pretty serious level, I'm not actually interested in those stakes resolving in that way.  It's a place I don't want the game to go.  Which is not a problem of <i>fear</i>.  I'm pretty sure that the game won't go that way, because I'll just say "no."  You know how it's lame to say "Our game will be about risking life and limb in search of treasure!" and then follow it up with "But, of course, PCs have script immunity and can't really die"?  In exactly the same way, it's lame to say "Our game will be about seeing whether Peter and MJs love can survive the difficulties of life," and then follow up with "But, of course, no matter how bad things look the love has script immunity, and can't really die."<br/><br/>There's basically two ways that a character can <b>be</b> something.  They can be something (the way Peter loves MJ) because we just flat-out want them to be, and they don't need to prove it.  Or they can be something (the way Luke is a Jedi, beyond hate and anger) <i>provisionally</i> ... not because we actually want them to be, but because we want to explore the question of whether they are or not.<br/><br/>Continually testing the character traits that are provisional is <b>good</b>.  "Oh, you're calm and controlled?  How about <b>now</b>?  How about when the rebellion is crushed?  How about when he threatens Leia?"  That's cool.  That's drama.<br/><br/>Continually testing the character traits that we just want the character to have is <b>bad</b>.  "Oh, you love MJ?  How about <b>now</b>?  How about when she goes out with Flash?  How about if she turns into a super-villain?  How about if she kills Aunt May?"  That's ... that's just a mistake.  I don't know how else to put it.  I feel in my gut that if their love really falls into the category of "stuff that makes the audience identify with the character" then doing that is a mistake.<br/><br/>I don't know how well I'm expressing this, or how solid it is.  At this point it's all new ground for me.  What do you folks think?                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>The more I think about it, the more I think that involving these traits as stakes in<i>any way whatsoever</i>is a recipe for disaster.<br/></blockquote>
I thought we were making cookies.<br/><br/>Seriously though, I can see saying "this trait is never <em>at stake."</em>  But an ongoing conflict doesn't have to mean that the <em>traits</em> are at stake.  By saying "these two traits are in conflict" I don't mean to suggest "Two traits enter!  One trait leaves!"  But Spiderman's two traits "Loves MJ" and "Great responsibility" could be brought into conflict, and what's at stake might be something entirely other.<br/><br/>First example: Green goblin drops MJ and a school bus at the same time.  "What do you do, Spidey?  Who can you save?"  Is loving MJ more important than his responsibility to a bunch of faceless innocents?  Can he really save both?<br/><br/>Second example: Crime wave hits New York.  Spidey's really busy saving the day.  MJ complains that he barely has time for him, and suspects another woman.  Let people get robbed and killed, or risk losing the love of his life?   Or reveal that PP = SM and risk her freaking out?  Or what?<br/><br/>And then I'm like, "wait, the guy who invented gloating mechanics is complaining about plot immunity?"                        </div>

                            Wow, I'm really sad that I got to this thread so late, since I have this huge long rant about how constantly escalating conflict is a really over-sold way of expressing and developping character. Suffice to say I agree with the original post, and also totally disagree with the idea that a character without a central conflict is unplayable or played-out. Conflict is a powerful narrative tool. Not all roleplaying is about narrative. And no, I do not mean not all roleplaying is Narrativist or not all roleplaying involves narrating, I mean that sometimes it doesn't matter what happens next in the story. Sometimes that really isn't what's important to the players, or to the characters. I feel like the focus on narrative techniques and narrative momentum is starting to become a crutch; a single solution someone found to 'what do we do next in this game' that has been developped to a reliable point and whose usefulness has made it overwhelming.<br/><br/>The idea that we <i>must</i> push characters to the limit to reveal important things about them is fundamentally flawed, and while few people seem to say it outright I feel like it is often a half-made assumption in conversations and game design in the community. The only thing putting a character in a highly stressful situation reveals about that character is how they act in a highly stressful situation. This is not any more who they are than how they act in a situation without conflict, without stress, where very little is at stake. If characterisation is an important goal, escalating conflict is really only one of very many tools. Every thing a character does is a piece of who they are, whether or not it makes a strong moral statement or involves a life-or-death situation, or any conflict at all. In fact, I would go so far as to say that most people react much more similarly to high-stress situations than they do to low-stress ones -- it is harder, not easier, to differentiate human beings in the middle of a battlefield.<br/><br/>The only game I've ever even started-designing is an expression of this idea -- that when you really sit down and think about people you know and what makes them who they are, you do not generally think of dramatic actions they took under stressful moral situations. You think about their donkey-like laugh, or the way they constantly abuse the phrase 'the fact of the matter'; how you remember them covering their desk in epic doodles in grade six, getting sent to detention, and doing the same thing on the desks there; the fact that they can sing the entirety of the HMS Pinafore from memory. These things are not best expressed or arrived at through conflict. Most people are not Robin Hood, they do not regularly end up deciding whether others will live or die -- this does not make them any less interesting, any less human, or any less worthy of roleplaying about. You do not need to push someone to the limit of experience to find out what makes them who they are. Sometimes you don't need to push them at all. You just need to watch.                        </div>

I feel in my gut that if their love really falls into the category of "stuff that makes the audience identify with the character" then doing that is a mistake.</blockquote>
Tony, just checking if I am following, would that be because the first example is telling us more about the character, while the second is changing who the character is?<br/><br/>ie. if what interests me is Peter loving Jane, then challenging that is challenging what I am interested in and if the challenge goes South you have destroyed what I was interested in, both outcomes aren't equally interesting.  If he still loves her, well I already knew that, if he doesn't, well there goes why I liked him.<br/><br/>With the first example though, we are not risking deleting the core element of the character that I like but rather details around the character.<br/><br/>I'll try another character example.  I'm playing Gord the Fighter, my concept is that Gord is a fairly dependable and loyal guy with a strong survival instinct, but the reason I want to play Gord is because I really like the idea of him as a cool two handed sword fighter.<br/><br/>Intentionally this is a rather crude concept by the way.<br/><br/>Now, a challenge that sees how loyal Gord really is, particularly if it sets loyalty against risking survival, that's cool.  That tells me more about Gord, just how loyal is he, just how much does his survival matter to him.  All good stuff.<br/><br/>A challenge that goes to whether Gord gets to stay as a two handed figher though, a challenge that maybe if it goes wrong leaves him one handed, that challenge directly threatens why I wanted to play him in the first place.  If the challenge is lost, the cool has been deleted.  With the provisional challenges win or lose the cool is there but now is broader.<br/><br/>Does that make any sense?  It could be a facet of all outcomes need to be interesting, an outcome that deletes what makes you like a character is not interesting.<br/><br/>No Gord's were harmed in the making of this post.                        </div>

                            Huh.  What if players had two big boxes on their character sheet for their character traits.  In one box are the "Safe" traits that can't be changed, and in the other box are the "Exposed" traits that can be changed (and probably are there to be changed)?  Then allow players to move traits back and forth between those two boxes as their interests change...                        </div>

                            Joshua,<br/><br/>I like that suggestion.  Quite a bit, actually.  But I see a couple of potential (solvable, I'm sure!) problems.<br/><br/>1. It's not always easy to know which traits are the ones you want to be safe and which ones you are okay with having exposed.  For some of my play (though not all), I don't know what it is that I truly value about a character for the first half-dozen sessions.<br/><br/>2. Related to the first.  Having a way of separating the two doesn't help us to generate them.  I don't know how to pick out good safe traits.  At least not many of them.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            Maybe Safe traits are worth more to you (and others) when you risk them, but they are correspondingly hard for you to risk (or for others to make you risk)? As in, one number for both those qualities. You might call it Mass. Hard to move, but substantial, versus easy to wield, but flimsy and transient?                        </div>

Three lines instead of five, but hopefully you get the picture?  At least through seasons one and two, nothing is taking away Starbuck's badassitude and bedrock faith.  However, she's constantly struggling with whether or not she's independent or part of the group, her unresolved feelings for Apollo, and her own feminity.  Note that this is really hazy, and spread out over forty episodes.<br/><br/><strong>Spoilery Stuff Follows:</strong><br/>Obviously, you might think, Starbuck's status as a Caprican couldn't be exposed/taken away, but consider Boomer, who lost her own Caprican status via revelations in the plot.<br/><br/>Her Apollo-love might be replaced with Anders-love towards the end of season two.  In season three, her Anders-love might be Safe instead of Exposed.  That's the whole idea: the scheme is dynamic.                        </div>

                            Josh,<br/><br/>Sort of helpful, but not quite what I was looking for.  I do think that I can reliably <i>identify</i> which traits in a given fictional character <i>are</i> safe or exposed.  My problem is in creating characters in such a way that they have safe traits that matter to me.  I mean, personally, I could care less about Starbuck's Caprician status.  It wouldn't matter whether it was safe or exposed.<br/><br/>So, what I'm looking for (and what I <i>think</i> Tony is looking for, I'm sure he'll tell us Monday) is a set of techniques that let me reliably pick out traits that matter to me personally, and to reliably know whether they need to be protected or not.  Does that make sense?<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            Tony, <br/><br/>This thread makes me happy. <br/><br/>Also, I didn't tell you so. I think Mo may have, but I don't remember for sure. I know she told me so though. <br/><br/>Anyway, as to the big question lurking above: 
<blockquote>The second question is, straight up, what I think is important: "What about this character makes you glad to be telling a story about them, no matter what the actual story is?"</blockquote>
This is a very hard thing to answer in many situations. I'm now going to ramble for a bit to try and get at something that itches me about this issue. <br/><br/>I'm very good at making characters with hard-core conflicts and radical explosive personalities. When I made the Rajput brothers for Spirit of the Century and Joshua RamaGupta (who used to play with me frequently) saw them, his response was, "Yea, so there Brand goes again." Others, with less exposure to me, loved the characters and found them fresh and cool. Josh, however, having been in so many games with me knew my tropes and saw them brought out again in new clothes and was less impressed. <br/><br/>One of the reasons I do this is that I'm powerfully, profoundly drawn to the image of the great man with the great flaw. I loved Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon because Li Mu Bai is so above the other characters that they can't even touch him, and yet he still manages at the end of the movie to fail as a man in every way that it is possible for him to fail. This tears me up in ways that are hard to fully describe, and I love the character because of his failure and because of his grandure. Same deal with, oh say... William Wallace in Braveheart, or de Valmont in Dangerous Liasons, or Bromir in Lord of the Rings. <br/><br/>So when I go to make an RPG character the fast and easy way (that is without doing something hard or new) I'll go for that trope, or some variation upon it. It resonates with me, it hits me in the gut, and (I think) I'm very good at making it come to life in game. No matter what the story might be that type of character will gut punch me every time, and so it becomes my default. <br/><br/>Ron has often talked about how the way to get at players when you're a GM is to put their real life issues into the game in one way or another. As he usually is talking about this in terms of horror play there is a frank emphasis on the negative in his commentary and rightly so. But I think the same thing can work for players and in other genres by some self-understanding. If you know the things that get you, IRL and in fiction, and can focus those onto your character, you will make a character that you will be glad to tell a story about no matter what the story might be. <br/><br/>Of course this is both as simple and as difficult as "know yourself" which isn't really all that good of advice, Socratic background or no. I think one way to start at it is to look at characters and character types that consistantly make you happy -- are you a Spiderman/Buffy lover, or do you lean towards Batman/Giles, or Robin/Xander? Why? When you see that character in episode after episode, what is it about them that gets at you? Is it the claws and cool toys, or is it the dark past and agnst? The normality and humor? <br/><br/>The first step towards learning a new skill is often to immitate the products of those who are masters of the skill, and so I think it might make a good place for us to start as well.                        </div>

                            Brand, I wasn't less than impressed; I just saw you go, "Ooo!  India!  Giants among men; heroic flaws!  Go!" and it was cute. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>As to the question, I may have a blindspot here.  I know what I like: irony.  I like the two sides of the coin, the seeming and the grotesque, thesis and antithesis and so on and so forth.  I like things that appear one way, then appear another way, and both appearances are commentaries on the other, and maybe somewhere in there is the truth of the matter.  Very nearly every character and every game I have ever played is a variation on this theme.<br/><br/>Now, regarding the safe/exposed thing, to me that has less to do with player security and keeping what you want than it does with pacing and choosing what things about your character are vulnerable <em>this time around</em>.  Because, since I love the reverals, there is very rarely anything about any character that I wouldn't mind making vulnerable to change -- except the dual, unresolved nature of the character.<br/><br/>I have played in a number of games where the GM or Staff or whatever desperately wanted to pin down my character as one thing or the other, heads or tails, either the seeming or the grotesque.  When I played Elektra, a childling redcap (12 year old child who was also a monster red in tooth and claw), I got a lot of pressure to either just be a little girl or to just be a monster.  What they didn't get is that choosing one or the other would simply kill the character for me.<br/><br/>So I don't know if character color (claws that go Snikt! / Kid with a Rock) is really the only thing that you're looking for here, Tony.  I think it may be one of many types of things that people use to connect to their characters, to care about them.  There's folks like Brand and I who really connect at the... I dunno, structural level, how a character is put together, regardless of what things the character is made of.                        </div>

It's okay if that stuff gets resolved, but once that happens <i>I'm through with them</i>.  It would be like taking away some of those traits that make character just cool.

                            Thomas, about ten years ago I had a conversation with Brett Evill where he pointed out that since dramatic conflict will transform a character, it's possible to "use up" a character and make them unusable for further play. This is a problem, if you're thinking in terms of serial fiction, because you can't reuse the character again. <br/><br/>So you have to think about what conflicts are never going to get resolved. For example, Batman cannot ever realize that violence will not fill the hole in his soul, and Peter Parker can't  ever feel that he's lived up to the responsibilities demanded of him. Those form constants of the characters, and provide the narrative motor you need to keep telling stories about them. <br/><br/>Everything else about the character can change, and as long as there are those one or two conflicts that never get resolved, it still feels like you've got the same protagonist. (Steven Brust's Vlad Taltos novels are a great illustration of this principle -- Vlad has undergone radical transformations, and really critical aspects of his personality and morality have changed over time, but the thing that's been a constant is that he is a permanent outsider, who has never found a culture that he can fully belong to.)<br/><br/>There are also interesting literary possibilities in deliberately refusing closure. Closure is a structural device we deliberately impose on stories, and you can push into interesting existential or naturalistic territory by deliberately violating it.                        </div>

But it turns out that I can't imagine a conflict that could even come close to engaging me in the way that the sexual tension between Mal and Inara does (at least for those characters).

                            Thomas, I submit that it's more than possible.  Watch Battlestar Galactica?  Boomer.  Gaius.<br/><br/>Tony, I think we're talking past each other.  I get that you dig on the particulars.  I don't.  I dig on the relationship of the particulars to each other.  So if I'm playing a Genteel/Monstrous character, the specific flavor of monstrous -- supernatural, madman, machiavellian -- doesn't matter to me.  Like, <em>at all</em>.  I'll pick the flavor of genteel and the flavor of monstrous based on the setting of the game, usually.  Which is why, for me, the particulars are a secondary phenomenon.  They're an outgrowth of what I do care about, and they're already pretty easy to come up with.  What's genteel in this situation?  What's monstrous in this setting?  Now, the question is: can you do something similar for your own tastes?  If so, maybe the reason you're having difficulty coming up with a procedure for particulars is because you're disregarding the foundation on which they're built.  Maybe you need procedures for the foundation.                        </div>

                            Thomas:  I dunno.  I tend to think that they're different things with a great deal of overlap.<br/><br/>Like if I say "Mal loves Inara and Inara loves Mal, but they can't get together because of their pride," I look at that and say ... "Eh."  It sort of leaves me cold.  But that's the conflict, yes?<br/><br/>But if I say "Mal is a proud man, and a funny man, and he makes trouble for himself and knows it, and knows it's stupid, but he won't stop doing it because he'd rather be who he is, in trouble, than someone else with a happier life," then I can look at that and say "Oh yeah, that's someone I <b>like</b>.  That's a person I'd be happy to see doing stuff."  And the relationship with Inara ... a lot of what makes that hum is all bound up in the stuff that Mal <b>is</b>, but I don't think he actually <b>is</b> in conflict with Inara in that way, if that makes sense.<br/><br/>Like, if you flashed forward to a world ten years in the future where Inara and Mal trusted each other and understood each other to the extent that Mal and Zoe do, I'd still be damn happy to see them.  It'd be <b>awesome</b> to see Mal and Inara kicking ass in that way, clicking together and understanding not only each other's strengths but each other's weaknesses, and loving the whole package.<br/><br/>It would probably make for a <i>very bad story</i>, unless (as has been pointed out) some comparable conflict was introduced for them to address.  But the fact that it was a bad story wouldn't make me any less happy to see them on screen.  Hell, at this point I'd be happy to see Mal and Inara guest-starring on <i>That Seventies Show</i>.                        </div>

Doesn't Mal need a conflict to show you all those things?  Unapproachable love with Inara is one of many conflicts that Mal is involved in where he gets to display his pride, his sense of humor, his devil may care attitude and grudging morality.  Involvement in a conflict is what takes those traits and make them part of a character we care about, and not just quirks (like his roundabout way of speaking.)  <br/><br/>So I'm not sure if Mal not being in a conflict with Inara does make sense.  Maybe in a very strict sense of "this is at stake, and we're resolving this conflict right now" sense.  Or even a Mal vs. Inara sense.  (Maybe in a Mal vs. Mal and Inara vs. Inara sense.  Well, Mal (with Inara helping) vs. Mal, and sometimes the other way around.  No, no, the other way...)  I'm seeing more the long form conflicts that you were talking about in another discussion.<br/><br/>But Mal in isolation?  Nekkid in the desert?  That's amusing for about a minute.  And he doesn't get to really have any of those qualities without something to play off of - and that play necessarily says conflict to me, in the long-form lit sense.                        </div>

                            JBR:  Right now I'm looking at these elements of character and realizing "Oh shit ... asking people to provide this hits them with a gigantic blank page of limitless potential.  It invokes writers block."<br/><br/>I want to figure out ways to get around that writer's block.  If I get that <i>down</i> then maybe I want to incorporate those elements into the mechanics itself, in order to make it easier for people to play what they create (and to reinforce the creation process through the offer of reward) but right now I'm just looking to help people get past the blank page.<br/><br/>For instance, if I gave people ten cards like this:<br/><br/>- Makes no bones about his failings<br/>- Wonderfully snarky<br/>- A simple, reliable guy<br/>- Passionate to a fault<br/>- Cleverer than his oppressors<br/>- Resigned to his bad luck<br/>- Sweet and innocent<br/>- Stands by his friends, right or wrong<br/>- Believes in something greater than himself<br/>- Open to the hurts of the world and to the joys<br/><br/>... and said "Okay, pick <i>three</i> of those that make you happy to see your character appear," would that help?  I tend to think that no, it wouldn't help.  It would still be a big blank page, because (while it excites thoughts) that constraint doesn't really give you a sense of how to make a character fit together in a way that will make you care about them.  It doesn't breathe life into the pieces.  I want to help people be able to do that, quickly (less than five minutes) and reliably (works <i>every time</i>).  It's a tall order.                        </div>

                            Actually, I'd get a lot of mileage out of "pick three."  That's sort of my internal process for creating characters in general. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>Let me take a look at this in another way, though.  This already happens, right?  Maybe not reliably, but it happens in games that exist.  Players end up creating characters whose elements they appreciate, whether or not they're engaged in conflicts.  How does it already happen?  How can you take that and make it into a sharp, formal process?  Can these things crop up in play (as I think they do now in existing games), or are you specifically looking for a solution that can operate pre-play?<br/><br/>Does M-B have time for a tutorial phase like Accomplishments in Dogs?  It's nice to have a little space of time to situate yourself with your character before jumping in feet-first.<br/><br/>And you didn't answer on 1001 Nights.  In that game, you write down characteristics of your character associated with each sense (sight, taste, touch, etc) and a piece of clothing.  These never impact the mechanics of play and yet they serve as touchstones for the character and are very effective.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>Does M-B have time for a tutorial phase like Accomplishments in Dogs?</blockquote>Misery Bubblegum is supposed to run start to finish in one hour.  The char-gen and accomplishment phases of Dogs take (in my con experience) between one and two hours.  So there might be room for <i>something</i>, but it'd have to be a darn sight shorter than in Dogs.                        </div>

The fact that we're not talking about it in this context doesn't mean I haven't given it (and continue to give it) an awful lot of thought.<br/><br/>Tony, I'd never doubt that you were thinking about conflict.<br/><br/>We may just need to agree to disagree.  My feeling is, if, in session <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, Mal get's spotlight, and his player's goal is "show us that he's proud," and he doesn't address it by means of some sort of conflict, then what comes across is Mal's mere quirk of pride.  If instead he looks around and sees Inara's listed "social station" and plays a scene where he awkwardly kind wants to at least have the haughty companion acknowledge him as an equal, even if he has to drag her down next to him, then they both get their traits out there as something real in there characters.  What I'm proposing is that a thing that distinguishes a quirk from a characteristic is that the latter has been involved in a conflict.  And we love proud, grudgingly moral Mal because he has these characteristics, as a consequence of them causing conflict.  His charming dialect is a marker of the character, but ultimately a throwaway because it hasn't been; to a limited degree ditto "Captain in the rebellion."<br/><br/>How is that not the case?  I'm honestly curious here, and hoping to learn something (maybe just that I'm smugly right...)  Elsewhere you talk about internal conflicts falling flat if no one cares - aren't those character ideas reduced to quirks because they didn't make it to conflict?  If not, why not?                        </div>

                            If it's super-super short, how about character introductions at the top of the game?  The GM outlines the most basic time and place (it's evening on the space station) and asks everybody what they're doing, with a procedurally-directed emphasis on starting characters off doing things that are expressive of their characters?  Cause if introducing my character is a <em>thing</em>, and I introduce my character talking to a guy in a seedy bar, then that's going to inform my play and everyone else's understanding of my play.  I'll be the guy who talks with disreputable characters in disreputable places.  I think you could get a lot of mileage out of explicitly directing focus of play.                        </div>

I think this is the crux of it for me -- as best I can tell, what you want is a system that helps people imagine fully-realized human beings in five minutes. I don't want to go out on a crazy-limb here and say that's impossible, but... to be honest, I think it's impossible. I still think the reason that conflict-driven play is so popular in indie games is because it's so easy to come up with conflicts. That part of the story is the easy part. <br/><br/>If characters exist only to fill roles in a situation or play out a series of conflicts, they are easy to manufacture <i>as the situation demands</i>. You want star-crossed love, you need star-crossed lovers; you want civil war, you need charismatic leaders; you want power and responsibility, get some super-heros. At the structural level (as Joshua has suggested), a very, very small number of a character's attributes are relevant. My star-crossed lover could be beautiful, could be ugly, could be suave, could be embarassed, could be Dutch, could be missing a little finger, could always have a snappy comeback ready, could never go down without a fight, could be a coward, could write bad poetry... or he could be absolutely nothing at all except a star-crossed lover.<br/><br/>This is in a roundabout way why I love DitV character generation (and every other make-up-your-own-traits system I've come across) -- because one of the things Dogs does is it lets me name any attribute I want as relevant to every single conflict that will ever happen to my character. The situation doesn't come first, my character comes first. And I don't even mean that the situations will follow from my traits -- though they might. The kind of "come first" I am talking about is "comes first in terms of what is important to this fiction." No matter what is going on, the rules will always support me in making it about my character and whatever thing it was about my character that I thought was awesome. In fact the rules demand that I make every effort to do so.<br/><br/>That said, Dogs does not have any mechanics that I can think of that help you come up with traits that will answer your second question -- what it does have that serves a similar role is an extremely evocative setting and premise, and a lot of advice about traits. But I can still go through Dogs chargen and end up accidentally taking a bunch of traits that don't add up to a character for me. This is part of what makes Initiations such a great idea -- they're as much about getting to know your character as they are getting to know the system.<br/><br/>I think the only way you can reasonably expect someone to create a fully-realised character in five minutes is if they are making a character they already know: if they are playing themselves, if they are playing parts of themselves, or if they are using pieces of people they already know in real life, for whom they already feel that level of empathy. Alternately, if they are playing a derivative character from a work of fiction they already love.                        </div>

You know, Daniel, this is my big point of disagreement with you.  Characters and human beings are two entirely different animals.  It's just that the former very often mimic the later (in order to breed, obviously.)  As soon as you equate the two, I start to tune out.  Which is a shame, because I largely agree with the rest of your post.

Assuming you were replying to me... So long as you actually do something in the bar.  There's a reason Han Solo isn't just talking shite with the two wanted criminals.  He's the seedy smuggler - whose seedy smugglerness has a bounty on his head, which gives him an obvious reason to want to ferry farmboy off this miserable rock.  If he's just chatting amiably with Greedo, how is that part of his character more than a quirk?  I'm thinking of the goofy sidekick characters from 80s toy-commercial cartoons.  Orco is a perfect example of a character who's traits were never involved in conflict.                        </div>

<blockquote>Doesn't Mal need a conflict to show you all those things?  Unapproachable love with Inara is one of many conflicts that Mal is involved in where he gets to display his pride, his sense of humor, his devil may care attitude and grudging morality.  Involvement in a conflict is what takes those traits and make them part of a character we care about, and not just quirks (like his roundabout way of speaking.)<br/><br/>So I'm not sure if Mal not being in a conflict with Inara does make sense.  Maybe in a very strict sense of "this is at stake, and we're resolving this conflict right now" sense.  Or even a Mal vs. Inara sense.  (Maybe in a Mal vs. Mal and Inara vs. Inara sense.  Well, Mal (with Inara helping) vs. Mal, and sometimes the other way around.  No, no, the other way...)  I'm seeing more the long form conflicts that you were talking about in another discussion.<br/><br/>But Mal in isolation?  Nekkid in the desert?  That's amusing for about a minute.  And he doesn't get to really have any of those qualities without something to play off of - and that play necessarily says conflict to me, in the long-form lit sense.</blockquote>
I think we need <em>contrast</em> between the characters to reveal a particular personality trait, but we don't <em>conflict</em>. For example, D'artagnan and the Three Musketeers are rarely in conflict with each other, but their traits are in stark contrast with one another; every pairing of the characters yields a strong contrast between them:<br/><br/>D'artagnan and Athos -- enthusiasm versus depression<br/>D'artagnan and Aramis -- directness versus subtlety<br/>D'artagnan and Porthos -- ambition versus contentment<br/>Athos and Aramis -- integrity versus moral flexibility<br/>Athos and Porthos -- wisdom versus foolishness<br/>Aramis and Porthos -- deceit versus honesty<br/><br/>We know that D'artagnan is notably ambitious because we can compare him with Porthos, and we know that Aramis is subtle because we can compare his behavior with D'artagnan's. We can do this even though the characters may not come into conflict with each other -- when we compare how Aramis conducts his love affairs versus how Porthos conducts his, we learn something about both of them.                        </div>

I'm not sure if it's a disagreement, or a clash of preferences, but in this case I was mostly going off the sort of reaction Tony was describing. Being "happy to see" a character, regardless of the situation, implies a certain level of attachment and also a certain amount of imagination invested in that character as something that exists outside of any given conflict/situation. To me that sounds like a shift in the perception of the character -- they now have a social presence, above and beyond their narrative contributions. You aren't happy to see them because now something interesting will happen, or because you can't wait to see what they'll get into next -- you're happy to see them because you <i>like them.</i><br/><br/>Now, maybe this isn't what Tony was getting at at all. When I said that it sounded to me like he wanted fully realized human beings, that was a guess -- and it's not at all incompatible with your response. It may be that part of what makes this a poor goal is that we want characters, not people, and characters only exist within the context of stories.<br/><br/>That said, the difference between "exists only within the context of stories" and "exists only within the context of conflicts" seems considerable to me. I think that finding ways to introduce and develop characters in the fiction of roleplaying games that do not depend on conflicts (broad or narrow) is a worthwhile goal.                        </div>

                            Joshua, I don't agree with you. You get conflict, in the literary sense, when the characters have irreconcilable goals, <b>and</b> there's a crucible that creates a crisis -- when there's no way for their divergent goals to coexist. You don't have conflict when the characters are merely different from one another. You don't even have conflict when the characters have divergent goals, but no pressure forcing them to resolve that disagreement. <br/><br/>As a concrete example, suppose that we're playing two heroines who both want to marry the handsome prince, in a country that forbids polygamy. Obviously, we have a conflict of interest between our characters. This is not necessarily a literary conflict, though -- if there's a dragon trying to eat us, and we have joined forces to Not Get Eaten, then the conflict in the story has nothing to do with the prince. Our different interests with respect to the prince, are not a literary conflict, even though we may be sniping and hurling insults at each other during the dragon-slaying sequence. That's because our divergent goals can coexist. <br/><br/>However, if the King then announces that there will be a royal ball, and the prince will select his bride from the attendees, now we are in literary conflict. That's because we will attain our goals or definitively fail to attain them at the ball.<br/><br/>Likewise, in the Three Musketeers, with a few exceptions the protagonists were never in conflict with each other. Either they had the same goals, or they had a more pressing goal forcing them to table their disagreements. Their interactions illustrated their respective characters without putting them in conflict. Aramis and Porthos never even talked to each other about their love affairs; it was us, the readers, who saw how Aramis used false identities, secret rendezvous sites, and romantic poetry, whereas Porthos was a straightforward love'em-and-leave'em kind of guy.                        </div>

Okay, so farmboy needs to get off the rock to pursue his destiny and escape the imperial forces that want to kill him.  If Han is the means to get them off the rock, without any conflict of his own, is he any more a character than the Millennium Falcon?  And aren't his seedy underworld contacts just a quirk, like his Correlian vest and pant piping?                        </div>

                            Neel, you're using a different definition of conflict than I am.

                            My suggestion, Tony, for what it's worth, is to give people a fill-in-the-blanks structure. Any blanks. Any structure.<br/><br/>Anecdote about overcoming writer's block: I had a novel that had been sitting at three chapters long for about five years. I didn't know what happened next. I developed, for a game that I now realize was misguided in many aspects of its design, a character sheet that asked a number of things about the character (physical description, capsule biography, significant life events, associates, values, beliefs, passions, fears, tragic flaws...). One day I decided to fill in character sheets for all the characters in my novel - and once I'd done that I knew what happened next.<br/><br/>EDIT: Sorry, I realized that this is just restating the problem Tony has already, in a way. I think you need to hit a certain level of specificity. "Why are you glad to see this character?" is too general, it doesn't constrain enough. "What does this character care about passionately?" or even "What are the character's distinctive features of appearance?" is probably more helpful.                        </div>

                            I think a lot of the problem comes from the fact that what I (and I take it, Tony) am talking about here is something that is fundamentally aesthetic.  It doesn't matter whether these traits are tied into conflicts or not.  (At least not as I use the term, Joshua's definition seems significantly more broad than my own.)<br/><br/>These are the things that I think are cool just because.  To use a silly example: I like long names.  The more syllables there are in a name, the cooler I tend to think it is.  That's just something that's cool to me.  When this is applied to characters, it doesn't matter whether they're involved in conflicts about that or not: the simple fact that they've got a many-syllabled name makes me smile.<br/><br/>So, in some sense, these traits are static, not dynamic.  We're interested in them as they are, not in how they do (or might) interact.  If they do interact, that's fine and dandy (and probably something else), but that's not what draws us to the traits.<br/><br/>And I (and maybe others) am just really bad at discussing this sort of thing.  I've got no practice at talking about static features that I find idiosyncratically interesting.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

Oh!  So that's what this discussion is about.  Sorry, I was confused.<br/><br/>As to overcoming the blank slate at chargen, I think I've demonstrated that at least for me, "what do you like about this character in isolation" isn't going to get me very far.  I think simple directed questions in the context of the character and the premise would push harder towards where you're going.  Simplest possible questions would be "what are the three things you like best about this character?"  In terms of <cite>Misery Bubblegum,</cite> you might ask questions like "what's the wrongest idea your character has about herself?"  Or, "What does your character like best about herself?"  Because the player is answering those questions, the answers will be at least a little bit interesting to them.  <br/><br/>I still like "What one thing do you hate most about your character?"  Idea looking for a home.                        </div>

                            Oh, right!  I remember ... something like "What do you want?" "Why do you, particularly and uniquely, need it?" and "What other player's character, by their fundamental nature, stands between you and that goal?"<br/><br/>They blank-paged people pretty hard, if I recall.  Great results when people finally answered them, but it took near on an hour to get them answered.                        </div>

                            Honestly, all those questions read as very open and very thinky.  What do I want?  Well, if I don't know your game, how do I know what I <em>can</em> (you know, usefully) want.  <br/><br/>Why do I, uniquely, need it?  WTF does that mean?  I mean I grok what you're getting at: why do I need the thing I want and not some other thing that might also suit...  which means that if what I need is a hot air balloon, and airline tickets would work just as well, then it's not a good want.  Which means I'm afraid to pick a want because it could be wrong... <br/><br/>If I can frame a gentle warning: be careful to get the whole game out of your head and into the book, because packing a Tony in every box could be cost-prohibitive.  <br/><br/>One possiblity, have a numbered list of questions, that start very hinty and get more broad, and suggest that as you get more experienced with the game you can skip some.  Like:
<ol>
<li>Is your character a boy or a girl?</li>
<li>What grade are they in?  (Quick aside about Japanese high school ranks, maybe.)</li>
<li>Is your character popular?  How popular, or how far outcast?</li>
<li>What cliques are your character in?</li>
<li>What three things do you like best about your character?  Least?</li>
<li>What do other people not understand about your character?</li>
<li>What's your character's biggest self doubt?  Biggest misconception about themselves?</li>
<li>What does your character want?</li>
<li>Who do they want it from?</li>
<li>Why can't they get it any other way?</li>
</ol>
Old hands can skip right to the last three.  New folks start at <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> and work down.  And by the time they get to the end, they've got enough of a clue to answer those questions with fluency.  At least, that's the theory.                        </div>

A tall order indeed. Caring about the PC in five minutes or less.

Could you expand on this?  How does looking at these things help me find stuff that matters to me personally?

This might be the IWNAY.<br/><br/>The two things dynamically changing are at the top of sheet, subject to GM testing, challenge, story arcs and even complete change.<br/><br/>You could even have the Player scribble a doodle, phrase, or explanation next to each trait tile as notes about development and meaning of that trait as Develop In Play.<br/><br/>Certainly the Player could decide when to 'trade zones' on these traits, moving something into more protected status and exposing other traits in balance.                        </div>

                            It seems that the traits you are talking about are our fundamental understanding of a character, and thus the first things you'd say about them. Kid with Rock is a kid with a rock. Malcolm Reynolds is a ship captain, ex-military, proud and afraid of commitment to anyone else's ideals. Inara is a Companion, a social creature and a lot tougher than she seems. Luke is a young Jedi with no common sense. <br/>
<br/>
I suspect that the first sentence you speak about a character will include all the most important traits which you identify the character by. So give 'em a few scenarios to give character responses to (as per the various lists of questions above) then make them write a sentence which describes the character's most important attributes. Other stuff is left to one side for conflicts and such like, but the first sentence is the key.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone remember the coke machine/change for a phone examples from In Nomine? These always struck me as good ways to start pinning down what you like about your character, and as neelk points out, this is contrast, not conflict. Contrast is key for me. 3 characters with all the same traits would almost immediately be in conflict because they would all want the same thing. They'd also be pretty pointless to have as characters, and they'd be unmemorable. But change one trait to contrast with the other characters and you suddenly have comparison between them which gives color to their exchanges (again, not a conflict; sometimes people just talk). Musketeers are a good example - all basically the same character but with some twiddle which gives the contrast and flavour to their exchanges. And we love them.<br/>

                            This is one of those uncomfortable moments, because I'm going to suggest that this is being overthought. Something I've done to Tony before. I may simply be too slow to keep up with y'all, and this post may be hubris. But, well, here goes anyhow...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's funny, because when I saw the title, I thought, "Damn straight." And then I started reading and started to think, "Well...what characters <i>are</i> only built on their conflicts. Don't characters in most games start with more than just conflicts?<br/>
<br/>
I think, in fact, that most people here are getting this to some extent. I don't know about Misery Bubblegum, but in pretty much every game, there's a lot of stuff put into character generation that doesn't have one whit to do with the character's conflicts. Things like character class, for instance. Or race.<br/>
<br/>
That is, I think that the normal paradigms for character creation cover the "non-conflict" interest angle prett well. In fact, for ages, that's all they did. It's only when we get to maybe WOD, and definitely Sorcerer that we see conflict mechanically embedded in characters at all. Until that point, conflict was something external thrown at the player, and usually had little to nothing to do with the character. Oh, sure, in Champions perhaps your DNPC was in trouble in the scenario, but that was ancillary to the scenario itself, just an add on. The idea of making play about the character conflicts alone?<br/>
<br/>
That's Ron's idea.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, sure, some people were probably doing it before him, but he identified it and first encoded it in a game. The point is that, prior to this, the only thing that made a character worth playing through the next "adventure" (conflict) was the special nature of his effectiveness. Kewl Powerz, or just ability to kill, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Those things still work, BTW. Sorcerer is just Conflict with Kewl Powerz from demons.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I agree completely with Shreyas, in that what makes a character from whom it's easy to come up with renewable conflict is simply to make the character a complex human. That's why I think HQ works so well for this, without having any special rules for making the character somehow grabby. Turns out that any well fleshed out character is automatically grabby. HQ, unlike many newer systems, goes a long way to enabling players to make fleshed out characters. An average fully filled out character sheet will have upwards of 60 abilities on it.<br/>
<br/>
And do you get writer's block, just because you have the ability to make "any" character? Well, no, because, just like in D&amp;D, again, we have a simple set of choices to make to create the character. It's like the above list of questions for HQ:<br/>
<br/>
1. What species/race is your character?<br/>
2. What culture was he brought up in?<br/>
3. What religion does he adhere to?<br/>
4. What is his social position AKA occupation (why doesn't he starve to death)?<br/>
5. What does he believe in most deeply (magic keyword)?<br/>
<br/>
Each of the answers to these questions brings along around ten abilities or so, and then you get to add on ten other random things about your character.<br/>
<br/>
Now, you don't have to add these all on at once - you can develop your character "As You Go." In fact, I've found that in actual play, starting with no character concept at all, you can have players develop a character in some detail <i>in just one scene!</i> Just by asking them the above questions, essentially.<br/>
<br/>
What's cool is that the situation also acts, then, as a catalyst for creating the character. So with the question structure, and the situation catalyst, I've never seen anyone have any trouble creating a character that, I believe, they could play through many conflicts.<br/>
<br/>
Why many conflicts? Well, the interesting thing is that the nature of the conflicts is, itself, a fruitful void. That is, there's a subtle difference between what people above are calling a character who has a conflict, and a character with potential conflict. Any character that has an ability of any sort has potential conflict, I'd argue. Any character with relationships and/or personality traits has <i>obvious</i> flags for potential conflicts.<br/>
<br/>
I say this specifically because a trait like "Love's Griselda" is not a conflict, but can easily be made into one. So can "Swordsmanship" actually, it's just not as obvious how. But you create the conflict simply by creating situation that makes the character make some decision about the ability in question. Like, "Do I take up the challenge to fence the master, or demure?"<br/>
<br/>
So, very simply, making characters with lots of "stuff" to them that says a lot about what's important to them, is quite a good enough way, it seems to me, to make a character playable across many, many conflicts. Which may be why my HQ game has characters with 80 sessions behind them.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not saying that short form with light characters isn't cool, too. Just that if you want characters who you want to play a lot, just make them realistically complex (or even dramatically overcomplex). It seems that simple to me.<br/>

<blockquote> It's only when we get to maybe WOD, and definitely Sorcerer that we see conflict mechanically embedded in characters at all.  <br/></blockquote>
I don't quite buy this.  To choose an example I'm familiar with: the FASERIP Marvel Super Heroes had a mechanical Karma penalty which was applied whenever a PC commited a crime or destroyed property, "even if the hero has a good reason or there are extenuating circumstances".   The game also featured dual Popularity stats for a hero's public identity and secret identity, with mechanical consequences. Playing the Hulk was pretty-much a decision to explore the trade-offs between using his powers and running afoul of these penalties.  Originally there was no char gen section, and the game could only be played with established-- often thematically loaded-- characters.<br><br>It also occurs to me that there was a Karma Pool mechanic in which 'noble deaths' could benefit surviving team members' Karma.  Again: a thematic trade-off between individual and team loyalty is implicit.                        </br></br></div>

                            And I'll go a step further than Tony: I've seen Players make up details that they find 'unfun' in play.

I think this is where I'm confused.  I think you can say "these are the things that <em>made</em> us loves these characters.  And these things are why this story <em>rocked.</em>"  But I don't know that you can reliably predict those things.  I'm trying to resist returning to a discussion about conflict here, but I really don't know that there's a way to find out what parts of a character will rock at the start of play.  You could have some ideas about that, but relying on them is a big gamble.                        </div>

                            Why's it a big gamble?  If you're playing a one hour session, and you say "Okay, I've got three things I fully intend to love about this character, and two major conflicts I want to drag them into," I think that would be a good thing.  If it turns out you don't really love one of the things as much as you thought, oh well, it's only an hour.  The next time you make that character (if you do) you'll choose something else.                        </div>

Maybe you could have different lists for different genres?  One of the genres that my group emulates is console role playing games, so each character has a signature weapon.<br><br>Or maybe since genre is kind of up in the air, after you figure one out decide something similar but different for all of the characters.  Like if you ever do mecha fighting, talk about details that are the same about pilot and mecha and details that are opposite (like Kenda is a shy person, but her mecha is flashy while both pilot and mecha have a lot of pink).<br><br>Like Indy's hat (in another thread), these details don't mean anything inside conflicts.  But details like this can both bring the group together and distinguish individuals (and people like to be a little bit different).                        </br></br></br></br></div>

For me, that's a big if.  I realize you're coming at this from the direction of M-B which is closed form.  <br><br>Also, if I'm going to wager an hour of time that the choices I make up front will be fun, when the designer doesn't have any idea how to make it more likely that they be fun, that's a real gamble.

Well, this may be what lots of playtesting is for: finding out what lists are productive. You're trying something new here, which is to reimport That Thing that trad RP is <em>very good</em> at producing over the course of long-form play back into purpose-driven, short-form gaming, and do it in, as you say, "five minutes."  Before play even starts. I suspect there will be some trial and error involved no matter what approaches you consider. Pick <em>something</em> and learn from the failures might be the best course of action.<br><br/>Best,<br/><br/><br/>Jim                        </br></div>

                            Well, how about instead of traits and conflicts and such, ask the character to sumit an <i>identity</i> for their characters. Tell them they have to assign superficial, intermediary and deep identifying character descriptors, so that they can get some idea of how disrupting or challenging those things will disrupt the character.<br/><br/>I dunno; I'm just trying to throw in some useful suggestions, but I'm with Supplanter here. It can be very hard to work out something like this from such a little amount of experience. My only other advice would be to look at the comic book and movie characters which were immediate hits and see if you can work out how the creator came up with their baseline personalities that they gelled so quickly with the audience. Then remember it probably took them more than 5 minutes too.                        </div>
