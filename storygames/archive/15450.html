That would require violating your publically announced support to help Germany, but it sure makes a lot more sense to me than genuinely helping Germany to grow.  (Seriously?  France helping Germany to grow?  Has history taught you nothing? :) )<br/>\n<br/>\nMy second thought is that England is looking potentially vunerable to a French invasion-- possibly with German help.  :)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jchokey" title="jchokey"><img alt="jchokey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jchokey">jchokey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350396/#Comment_350396" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-03T16:32:48+00:00" title="December  3, 2011  4:32PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 3, 2011 4:33PM by jchokey.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Doesn't the early board leader tend to get jumped by everyone sooner or later?"<br/>\n<br/>\nNot necessarily.  It can happen, yeah, but IME, it's not a sure thing.  If you can get a secure ally or two, who sees that helping you is good for them, even though you're bigger than they are, that can be a great way to avoid the 'gang up on the leader' tendency. I've generally found that if allies get at least one power center for every one (or even two) you take, they're content to help you, even if you're more powerful.  That's especially true, if you show good faith by say, giving one up that you already control e.g. letting England move a fleet into Holland in exchange for supporting you into Kiel or something like that).  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that can make for an impressive juggernaut, if your alliance is indeed secure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350398/#Comment_350398" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-03T16:37:57+00:00" title="December  3, 2011  4:37PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good stuff, thanks, James!<br/><br/>I'm particularly looking for more big-picture diplomatic strategies than specific tactical advice (which I can figure out pretty easily myself).

That sounds terribly snooty of me, I know, and I'm not a Diplomacy grandmaster myself (perhaps Eero will come along to comment), but when you see France with four non-home centers in the Fall of 1902, including Belgium and Holland, plus a fleet in Marseilles, you can surmise that the people playing England, Germany and Italy are not making the wisest choices.<br/><br/>That's important because the wise, rational advice ("France is actually in a dangerous spot, because your neighbors have every strategic and tactical reason on earth to band together against you") might be moot..<br/><br/>So maybe the actual wise advice for this game* is to press this giant, crazy advantage like a drunk man wielding a hammer and go after all those under-defended centers. Like, say, Germany and Italy. And you can tell England "Hey, it's cool, man, we're bro's. Here, have some support into Denmark."<br/><br/>* I think a cardinal, but often-overlooked, truth of Diplomacy is that the smartest, most historically-validated strategy for playing the game in general is nowhere near as valuable as a half-assed plan for playing the actual, specific game you're in at the moment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350431">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350431/#Comment_350431" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-04T03:27:35+00:00" title="December  4, 2011  3:27AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good advices here. As Steve suggested, your mid-term goal should be to ensure that your neighbours will not be in a realistic position to project force against you whenever the other players wake up. It's not going to be useful for them to know that you dominate the board if they won't have the right forces in the right places for stopping you at that point. In this regard German and Italian wars in the east are both swell, and best motivated by having eastern Powers advance credibly in step with you.<br/><br/>Specifically, France will benefit most from a dead England and an Italy embroiled in a continental war, so if you could arrange for an Austro-Italian war and an alliance with Russia (perhaps Italy-Russia-France triple alliance, which could be your long-term breadwinner), that would be an appropriate stepping-stone: you could depict Russia as a rising power, try to make him big and strong (and inconsequential to you), encourage everybody else into building armies to stop the Russian horde, build fleets yourself, kill England (ideally with little noise, although it's likely that the other players will realize the true nature of the game once a player falls), betray Italy and finish with Russia in second place. It is notable that Germany is a low priority threat for France as long as eastern pressure is kept up: Germany has all the reason to be invested and interested in eastern situations, so if you have a working relationship and Germany doesn't enter a western war early, then you can take your time, feed German complacence and maybe attack him in the back once you've got England and Italy sewn up.<br/><br/>Of course, looking at this board position, it might not be possible to save the Russian; his southern line is so weak that only full support of the Turk will save Rumania from Austrian annexation. Then again, the Austrian should probably look to his own defenses. There should be room here for you to create your own spin that ends up with Germany and Austria fighting a war against Russia and Italy. Turkey could go either way, but you'd probably prefer it if he were playing his usual scheme of allying with Russia against Austria while waiting for a chance to "stab" the Italian. This arrangemend is a long-term goal, short-term it's probably most important to abuse the players from any early-game optimism regarding their ability to trust each other. Do whatever it takes to make Russia more powerful as a continental power, and the rest will pretty much take care of itself. Russia is your best ally here, insofar as we understand "ally" as somebody who's growing strength is also to your benefit.<br/><br/>What I would do diplomatically with such a strong position would be to not deny it, but downplay its significance. Allow the other players to feel that they can talk to you and influence your direction. Let's practice: "Yeah, I'm doing pretty well now. It was lucky that I got France, it's the strongest Power on the board due to the lack of natural enemies. I wonder what direction I should turn to, now?"<br/><br/>Also, have a third-party (Russia would be ideal, he has an interest in the deception) start spreading rumors about an English intent to move to the Channel and start a surprise war against France. Perhaps Russia convinced England to stop their mutual bickering, and he doesn't quite know it, but he can guess that the English turncoat move will be to attack France now that he's in peace with Russia. This will be your casus belli when you move to the Channel yourself, it'll be more convincing if the other players heard in advance that England might be moving on you; you aren't actually going to attack England, heaven forbid, but you had to make the move to defend yourself, because you heard this rumour. Once you're in the Channel and get your actual surprise convoy it won't matter what England thinks afterwards, but ideally Germany will think that you chose to attack England over attacking Germany.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350439/#Comment_350439" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-04T10:11:05+00:00" title="December  4, 2011 10:11AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting stuff, people! <br/><br/>Most of it is in line with what I was thinking already, particularly Eero's advice.

(frex, on the map, the Austrian's army in Galicia is as much a diplomatic fact as it is a strategic one, yeah?) Actions speak louder than words after all, so you generally want to make sure that your moves on the table reinforce your story and your story reinforces your moves.<br/><br/>So you'd generally (i) pick a target, (ii) fabricate a reason that'd be seen as justified by other players for actually attacking it, and (iii) then take what's rightfully yours.<br/><br/><br/>To answer your actual question... I'm coming up empty on foolproof diplomatic strategies you could use. Generally, I'd guess you'd want them to attack each other, but without actually asking them to do it yourself (no one likes a ringleader), which is a tall order.<br/><br/>A mild way to foster a general level of mistrust is to outline a purely rational, theoretical way of why, say, England is or will be in the future be a danger to Germany, then ask if the other player has considered it. Nothing too pushy, just facts and asking of opinions. Granted, you probably already employ this fairly often already.<br/><br/>Alternativelly, you could just draw attention to something that the other guy may or may not be already considering a threat, and then gracefully propose yourself as a mediator to solve "the issue."<br/><br/>Example, straight from your game: "Oh hello, Italy! Listen, I don't want any of us central powers to start infighting so that the outer ones could start nibbling at us from the sides... So if that German army in Tyrolia is bothering you, I could try talking to the German to remove it." If Italy wasn't considering that army a threat before, he'll have to do it now, even if it's in the form of "Wait, what is France talking about here?"<br/><br/>Basically, sowing seeds of doubt at every corner. Not all of those seeds will grow up or even bear fruit, but some of them might, and that's probably as good as you can get.<br/><br/><br/>Fair warning: most of this is conjecture rather than experience talking. Do with it as you will.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350455/#Comment_350455" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-04T15:06:09+00:00" title="December  4, 2011  3:06PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite><br/>The idea about spreading a rumour about an English attack on France is interesting! Is there a way I can pull this off without lying to anyone?</blockquote>\nWell, you'll need to lie to eg. Russia to get the rumour started, but it's a lie that's difficult to pin down, and one you can't be called on afterwards, and one you can qualify a lot. For example, you might approach the Russian to ask him about whether he's been talking with the English (quite a natural thing to ask, you should talk the most with the people you're fighting), and whether he knows if England is planning to stab you. You develop the theme by explaining that of course you wouldn't expect the Russian to reveal such a plan to you if the two have already achieved an accord, but perhaps you could convince the Russian to ally with you, instead? And then once the Russian denies one or both suppositions (the English stab and the Russo-English alliance), you'll tell him that actually, you heard this from a third party (you might name eg. Italy if you had to, as Italy has a natural motive to both know about such a plot as well as fabricating the entire thing), so maybe the Russian is holding back on you?<br/><br/>The goal here is to convince the Russian that you're suspicious of England and have got it into your head that he might be plotting to move to the Channel. Once you've accomplished this, you confide in the Russian and try to get him to ally with you against the English in case of the attack; tell him that you'd rather prefer to operate on the continent, but you'll be holding back a bit of force in case the English threat realizes, and you also want to set it up with the Russian that he'll back you up against the English if your fears come true. Now, even a substandard Russia should push at you at this point to make you commit to fight against England immediately on his side; you'll be hesitant and complain about how you've been getting along with England pretty well, really. Then you break the negotiations and <i>ask the Russian to ask the Germans (or other likely party) about it</i> - you're interested in the alliance, but would also like to know more about the board situation, so how about Russia asks around a bit to find out whether that English threat is real.<br/><br/>Ideally the Russian, now that he's been given a clear mission with a clear reward, will go and ask about the English thing from everybody. He might even ask the English. He might or might not mention you, which doesn't do any harm, as your ultimate goal here is to establish a casus belli and portray yourself as a bumbling, happy fool who just happens to end up in a war with England due to a funny misunderstanding probably concocted by the Italians or Russians. So the Russian goes around and then comes back to you <i>at the end of the negotiations</i>, which is the optimal time to close an alliance, and he tells you what he discovered: probably it's going to be that nobody knows anything for certain, because he wants to be honest with his new ally, but he also might color his tale to various degrees, or somebody else might even have colored it for him. No matter, you're going to take what he gives you and plot with him against the Englishman, all the while making sure that he trusts you and intends to keep everything very, very quiet. Depending on the particulars you might commit to a surprise attack on England, or you might just tell the Russian that you'll keep a vanguard while going to eg. Germany; what you tell him is not important, as your actual move to the Channel can be retroactively justified as a secret defensive move you decided to take because you thought that England might be coming at you <i>right now</i>.<br/><br/>(What if England hears the rumour? There is a distinct danger here, for were I England, I would naturally answer this sort of rumour by actually doing the move suggested therein, or by concocting an even more dastardly counter-move. Still, even the worst-case scenario has you make a harmless bounce with England, which may be easily spun into a stab on the next turn. It'll also lay good groundwork with Russia and Italy and Germany, who all see that England actually was plotting to move against you. Self-made prophecy is the worst outcome, it seems to me.)<br/><br/>The ideal outcome of this process is that your next move looks like you're going to be a happy and dumb France who just shores up his positions against Germany and Italy (without betraying either - you'll agree with them in advance about the borders, and stick to those agreements), but also moves to the Channel as a separate, accidental brainfart. Once your move comes up you declare loudly how you're doing it because the Englishman is going to bounce you there; once the bounce doesn't come, you'll be embarrassed and keen to make amends to the Englishman, so at to prep him for the convoy on the next move. The important point is that on the first move the whole board (with the possible exception of Russia) thinks that you were just making an overly paranoid defensive move; you can tell England that Italy told you that England had offered an alliance against you, and the whole board will subtly back the idea that a possible English stab had been in the air earlier. This whole thing hopefully allows you to have a surprise against England without giving the other players cause to see you as the ruthless and conniving backstabber you really are.<br/><br/>The only place in the above where you absolutely need to lie is when you first concoct the story about Italy telling you that England offered to stab you. By providing this unsourced to a third party (Russia) and being skeptical about it yourself, you give yourself quite a bit of distance from the rumour. The fact that you're going to "ruin" your English relations because of that same rumour further insulates your credibility - why ever would you yourself start a rumour that causes you to make a "mistaken" move?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Finally:<br/><br/><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>This arrangemend is a long-term goal, short-term it's probably most important to abuse the players from any early-game optimism regarding their ability to trust each other.</blockquote>\nMore about this, please! I'm not too sure how to get about this one.<br/><br/><br/>The usual, really: tell the other players about the full range of tactical possibilities the other players have while staying silent about the strategic reasoning they might have for not putting those possibilities to use. Focus inordinately on ruining the relations you want to see ruined, and on improving the relations you want to see improved. Lie about what the other players have told you (but in a way that preserves your credibility even if they deny their supposed words later, of course). Give true advice, but only give the advice that strenghtens Austro-German and Italo-Russian relations; stay quiet of anything that would go the other way.<br/><br/>The short-term goal is to cause the other players to trade diplomatic credibility for material gains of fleeting nature. For example, you'll want to exaggerate the benefits for Austria in risking a German stab and going for Rumania right now, as that will cast the lines for the eastern conflict and draw Germany into pushing for Warsaw. Similarly, you'll want Italy to move against Austria (and Turkey, keeping both in the game), even if you need to drop a hint about your anti-English plans. (Italy has a vested interest in you going against England, so even if he blabs it's not going to be as credible as it could be.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>What kind of timeline are you looking at in terms of some of those maneuvers (particularly an attack on England)?</blockquote>\nI would go to it immediately, you already have everything else you need. Your position is even Mediterranean-heavy, so as long as you can turn in the proverbial dime without getting Italy up your ass, it's going to be a pretty good surprise attack. Of course you'll need to be reasonably confident that Germany is committed to the east (against Russia, ideally) and Italy is as well. Once those two see you back off, they should be happy to let you and England duke it out, unless they timed their own attacks against you to happen on the same turn.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>How do you "make sure" there's bad blood between particular people?</blockquote>\nMostly it happens by encouraging them to play a bold and aggressive game where they trade political influence for material gains they cannot hold. The cardinal skill in Diplomacy is to recognize the difference between strategic gains and merely material ones; the former become an organic, defensible unity that provides you with influence, while the latter are merely unnatural extensions of your sphere where you're forced to commit not only political credit, but also one or more units. This is why France is well served by killing off England, and why attacking eg. Italy or Germany is not very attractive; both of the latter are endgame moves in that they're battlegrounds that you will remain on until the end of the game once entered.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350696/#Comment_350696" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-06T12:34:47+00:00" title="December  6, 2011 12:34PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DWeird</cite>Then you've either figured out your next attack already, which you should tell us so we could help you plan better, or you're thinking you can solve the game by diplomatic means alone, which is probably a mistake.</blockquote>\nDaumantas, you're on to me! Smart guy, you are.<br/><br/>Very interesting advice all around. 1903 will take place tonight! We will see what is going on.<br/><br/>My suspicion is that most of these tactics will fall somewhat flat in the particular play climate we have (lots of beginners, many timid players, no one with a real grasp of Diplomacy dynamics: for instance, I don't think it would occur to most players that Italy talking about an English attack on France could be rumour-mongering because of Italy's board position). My current approach seems to be working quite well, I'll stick with that for now, without revealing too much in case someone stumbles on this thread.<br/><br/>As for the various powers, my current observations:<br/><br/>* Russia and Austria-Hungary are the most aggressive players.<br/>* Italy is super-conservative, safe, timid, and not too involved in the actual diplomacy.<br/>* Turkey is the second most conservative player, very trustworthy, solidly allied with Russia.<br/>* England is the most experienced player, and seems to trust me very much at the moment.<br/>* Germany is a bit of a wild card but is a total beginner and for now follows my directions pretty much to the letter: I feel confident I have a listening ear here.<br/><br/>Hence my current tactic of encouraging Italy to go against Turkey, England against Russia, and Germany is my main "partner" in the war. <br/><br/>Tonight will be interesting! I'll let you know how it goes.<br/><br/>Still interested in more discussion of how to maintain diplomacy when you're the largest power, however.<br/><br/>My first game with this bunch (not the exact same players, but some overlap and same GM) ended in a solo victory for me, but mainly because I got everyone to work against the largest power and grew "in the background" until I could move quickly into the win. I'm not sure what I would have done had I actually been the largest power in that position!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350701/#Comment_350701" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-06T13:07:22+00:00" title="December  6, 2011  1:07PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It occurs to me that it might not be a bad idea at a relatively green table to conquer some non-integral SCs and then outright give them out as gifts to your "best" allies (meaning, the players you least wish to stab you). Alternatively, simply supporting such allies because you can afford to help others would be a strong signal as well. This might be seen as a gracious and non-aggressive gesture from a leading player, a gesture that would seem to indicate a willingness to avoid confrontation by helping your allies get a leg up as well. In reality you would of course select any such gifts with an eye on entangling and committing them to do your bidding. When framed correctly, doing something like this can engender blind loyalty; such concrete largesse is a rare thing in secure and powerful Powers, after all.<br/><br/>Examples of how to play according to this principle as a dominant France would be supporting England into Denmark, supporting Germany into Venice and supporting Italy into Munich. (Not all at once, obviously.) All of these are moves that entangle your immediate neighbours with each other while providing them little benefit; all of those SCs are poisonous to the mentioned Powers when taken before certain antecedents are in place despite their relative proximity. Sometimes you get an opportunity to develop a truly grandiose buffer state in this way; for example, you might attempt to attract Germany into helping you with some non-essential moves against England in exchange for <i>Norway</i> (ideally with Russia still in Sweden), which will then force Germany into essentially taking England's place as the northern buffer against Russia, which in turn means that Germany will be unable to commit against you later on, even as you may choose to attack his overly thin lines whenever you desire. It's surprising how foolish things players can do when you frame those moves as gifts and favours.<br/><br/>(When playing Italy I sometimes develop this principle into outright condottiere warfare where an army of mine detachs from the homeland forces for the specific purpose of manipulating other players into conquests that will deadlock their war. By doing this Italy, with its relatively static position, may gain a strong working relationship with a potential ally while simultaneously entangling that same ally in a war they cannot possibly win. Most other Powers are better off working their units in their own advantage, of course, except perhaps when you're so dominant as France is in your game right now.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Piers" title="Piers"><img alt="Piers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Piers">Piers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350702/#Comment_350702" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-06T13:21:47+00:00" title="December  6, 2011  1:21PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 6, 2011 1:23PM by Piers.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One interesting tactic you might consider in this situation is deploying an "ambassador unit."<br/><br/>Lots of things can go wrong with this, and it requires a certain amount of organization to put into effect without pissing people off, but the basic idea is to deploy one unit far behind enemy lines. From there it becomes a lever for negotiations with players on all sides, giving you a vital, but also somewhat innoffensive stake in ongoing negotiations on the other side of the board. <br/><br/>Thus, for instance, if you were to persuade the Germans and Austrians to gang up on Italy and take Venice while moving the Gascony army into Marseille, you then have an opportunity to move into Piedmont to assist Italy / Germany, and then over a number of years wander / retreat up into the no-mans land between Germany, Austria and Russia. Alternatively, if you can sell Germany on it, you might move into Munich at the beginning of the year and then out up to the front to "help" before you take the center.<br/><br/>From there you can probably see the opportunies to play all sides against each other.  It is devilishly hard to destroy a force when it doesn't have to defend a supply center to maintain itself. The secret is to allow this to happen naturally and to act hapless and confused about it. Rather than negotiating agreesively, you can sollict advice about what to do with the army that has just happened to end up over there.  As you might imagine, everyone will have something they want to sell you with, and it gives you great leverage for your activities elsewhere.<br/><br/>Finally, there is the advantage that having even a single unit over on the other side of the stalemate line makes it far easier for you to break through in the endgame. Its a nice little bit of extra insurance.<br/><br/>(Cross-posted with Eero.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350725/#Comment_350725" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-06T18:16:30+00:00" title="December  6, 2011  6:16PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent advice.<br/><br/>With these more sophisticated tactics (funny, I was just reading about the "ambassador unit" today), I would love to hear some specifics!

Which of those could I potentially move towards in the near future?</blockquote>\nGive Norway to Germany and stand ready to give Tunis to Turkey and Munich to Italy. The latter two are diplomatic leverage you can bring out in negotiations: for example, if Germany attacks Italy now, that's something you need to snip in the bud, and one way of doing that is to move to Burgundy, promise Italy some support and tell the German that you're willing to interfere to ensure that your dear Italian ally stays unmolested. Similarly, if Italy decides to attack Germany, you can move a fleet to Wes and let it be known that you're not averse to practical peace-keeping.<br/><br/>The reason for why you don't want an Italo-German war at this juncture is that you have better things for those two to do; Italy needs to ally with Austria against Turkey and betray Austria in Russia's favour later, while Germany needs to feel like he's useful to you while he fights the unfavourable eastern war with Russia. Not that I expect an Italo-German war here (it's usually a stupid idea), but that's pretty much the scenario where giving out those particular SCs might come up. I guess you could give Munich to Austria, too - same considerations apply. (As you can see, I've got the course of the game all planned out. Now you'll just need to make the other players do all this.)<br/><br/>Norway, however, is a natural gift to give, as it's going to be vulnerable when you assault England, and you don't want it to fall to your supposed ally Russia, as a Russia in possession of Norway is already halfway to Edinburgh. (What you want is to retain initiative: when it comes time to sweep Russia and Germany off the Baltic, you'll be choosing that moment. This is possible if you ensure that England's fall does not cause the Nordic area to fall to Russia.) The clever monkey would suggest to Germany at this point that he might want to play Kie-Den, Den-Ska, Sil-Ber. It depends on the particulars whether this might be justified as anti-Russian or anti-English, but the main idea is that Germany will benefit from defending in the Warsaw corridor instead of attacking (various tactical reasons, you can see it), while up in Scandinavia Germany will be in good position to threaten Sweden from Skagerrak. On the next turn, assuming you can set up for a stab against England, you'll be in good position to engineer an alliance between Russia and Germany in taking Norway: Swe S Ska-Nwy is good for Russia because Germany can't keep Norway in the long term and you're his real ally (so he thinks), and it's good for Germany because he's too green to realize that a Norway sandwiched between French and Russian spheres is of no use to him. England won't realize the danger, as he thinks that Germany is attacking Sweden, and only does it via Skagerrak out of stupidity.<br/><br/>(By the way, do ensure that Russia doesn't convoy that Livonian army to Sweden. He's massively understrength down south as is, and putting everything up north because you think that your dear ally the Sultan isn't going to betray you is just the sort of thing you see people do in this game.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite><br/>I suppose, though, that if Italy makes signs of aggression, I'll be the first to step up and offer Germany a hand into Venice.</blockquote>\nYes, don't ruin (or rather, bring to a new level) your Italian relations just to ensure that Germany is kept busy - you can keep Germany busy by brokering an Anglo-German alliance against Russia just fine. Just give Russia some subtle foreknowledge and don't waste time stabbing England - and offer Germany a share in the spoils (the Nordic area can be his, you just want to demilitarize Nth) once your intentions are clear.<br/><br/>(I should mention that not all players of Diplomacy find attacking England to be an excellent idea. I do, however; insofar as I'm concerned, France needs a reason not to attack England, not the other way around. A trusting England is the best kind, as the unfortunate fact of the matter is that England cannot be conquered without a surprise attack in the early game.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stefoid</cite>I would like to have an online diplomacy game with you people.

(And then I can call it quits, or continue posting if people want to follow along with the game.)<br/><br/>Right now, I'm making sure everyone knows that my reasons for attacking England were that I found out they were organizing action against me and lying through their teeth about it: I couldn't afford to let them have a build from Sweden.<br/><br/>I'm also thinking of pursuing a strategy of annexing England entire (hopefully with them still holding Sweden and Denmark, if not, maybe Germany and Russia can split those two), but otherwise remaining peaceful towards everyone.

Taking England entire is pretty much the most natural piece to integrate into the French empire in the early game. If France has a weakness as a Power, it's that he doesn't have too many integral conquest options that would synergize well and be easy to claim, at least not after taking the freebies. Some other nations excell in this regard; Austria and Italy, for example, have many options for smaller and larger acquisitions that can be secured at different stages of the game without making the empire too difficult to defend and without killing off other Powers. With England the sad fact tends to be that you'll have to kill him off in pretty short order, but at least you should be able to roll your dominant Atlantic position over into control of the Nordic area as well. At that point you're close to soloing, really, as you'll just need to roll over Germany and/or Italy.<br/><br/>Were I playing here, I'd go into deep negotiations with England, agreeing upon as beneficial a peace treaty as you can, followed upon by an immediate second stab England won't recover from. The position you have here is what differentiates the ruthless from the merely nasty: the ruthless player understands that the very fact of your successful assault makes England well-motivated to hope and believe that you'll spare him, which can be used to surprise him a second time. After that he will become cynical, of course, but not only will it be too late for him at that point, but the pressures of desperation will be even greater, and easily manipulated in different ways.<br/><br/>(The tactical position doesn't have many opportunities for England to miscalculate, but if you can get him to think that you'd eg. trade Liverpool for London, then he could well waste his turn trying to conquer Denmark instead of moving Nth-Lon.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>I'd love to hear about a long-term diplomatic stance which could rescue this situation from a potential "pile-on" against France.</blockquote>\nFoolish players are difficult in this regard, as they can go beyond the call of duty in attacking a board leader. You can avoid this in your diplomacy by understanding the psychology that lies behinds such attitudes. Here's the secret: when a mediocre player goes above and beyond, it's because he is being relieved from the pressures of uncertainty and ambition by having been able to seize upon a dictum or dogma that he's following like a drowning man holding onto edge of the bathtub.<br/><br/>What the above means is that you can avoid having the other players drive you off the board ignomiously if you can keep them from establishing the wrong dogma in their small minds. When the pressure mounts and they are seeking answers, you need to make sure that they do not seize upon any that involve attacking you. The uncertain player is the most certain to fall to dogma, and the most certain to overdo it, which is why the green table is the most chaotic. If left to their own devices, these players will correctly conclude that they need to attack you right now, and it's going to be likely that they will also overdo it, continuing to attack you long after your edge has been dulled, simply out of pedestrian joy and relief they find in following the credo that delivered them from the pits of uncertainty.<br/><br/>(I know that I write pretty snottily about your co-players here. I mean nothing by it, I'm just projecting the sort of supervillain attitude that is useful for a ruthless, confident and cunning Diplomacy player. Think like everything on the board were happening because of your connivations, and you'll be right more often than not. If I sound prideful and comically self-centered when discussing Diplomacy, it's because my game voice is showing through.)<br/><br/>The key to preventing the other players from forming dogma that is counter to your interests is, of course, memetic warfare and propaganda: you need to establish your own models of thought, ones that run to your own benefit. Because the inexperienced player lacks his own modeling capacity, he will be glad to have you provide the frameworks through which to think. This doesn't even mean that they need to agree with your proposals, it's sufficient for you to be the one who frames the discourse: topics, dilemmas, ranges of solution and so on. Once you give the other players rich toolboxes of strategy and tactics, they'll never notice the fact that your box conveniently altogether lacks the sort of screwdriver needed to get to Paris. The other players may quite freely disagree with you when you recommend option A over option B as long as <i>you were the one who chose both options in the first place</i>.<br/><br/>In practice, looking at the current board, I would work on Russia and Germany a lot diplomatically, as it'll be immensely useful for you to keep those two out of your hair for the next bit, as you finalize your English conquest. The trick is to promise to give the Nordic area to Russia: you'll support him into Norway once you get a fleet into position, of course, but ideally he'll take Sweden himself with German aid (which he'll have to arrange himself). Meanwhile, Germany needs to push at Russia; it's sad that it's going to be so ineffectual, what with the German position being so laughable, but if you can improve it a bit, then try to get a German fleet to Bal and some more pressure on Russia from that direction.<br/><br/>In both the Russian and German case you need to focus on providing them dogmatic frameworks and plans that support long-term loyalty towards you. Hinting at long-term mutual interests is always useful in this regard, so you might tell the Russian that once England is finished you can demilitarize Nwg-Nth and attack Germany together, for example. With Germany you promise to help him against Russia immediately after you finish England. This latter is what you're actually going to do, I would think, unless the board develops some character; Controlling the entire Atlantic seaboard by seizing Nwy, Swe and StP is immensely useful. Of course your goal there is to ensure that Russia prospers down south even while you're attacking him north (I've discussed this principle before, you always want to prop up weak players), so as to prevent Germany from actually growing strong. He's your next target after you've seized StP, after all...<br/><br/>The German player seems too scatter-brained to trust, by the way. That type of player in my experience either settles down into a loyal ally after the first inept stab, or continues clowning around until somebody takes them out of their misery. Figure out which this guy is; I suspect that you can't delay attacking Russia even one year after England is done, but at least you might ensure that Germany faces such massive pressure from the east that he won't get any clever ideas when you're operating against the Czar.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>You could also conceivably attack Germany from this position, even right now. The English prospect is better, though (removes an actually dangerous neighbour), and you don't want to have the two ally against you. But your cover story for England might well be that once you supposedly agree to his peace you'll start pestering him about Germany: promise him Denmark in exchange for help against the Kaiser. It's a pretty credible direction for you to take with a German player as clueless as this, so England should find you pretty believable. What's better, you can provide immediately on the next turn regarding Denmark by cutting Kiel - not that you'll do it, but it's an entirely credible idea that you'd play Hol-Kie, Bel-Ruh, Bur S Bel-Ruh. Were I England, I well might fall for this, especially if I'd concluded myself that the Kaiser here is meat to be wasted and no sane player wants to keep him around.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350823/#Comment_350823" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-07T15:05:58+00:00" title="December  7, 2011  3:05PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a good thing to remember that there are other issues at play that influence whether other players will want to attack you.<br/><br/>Look at that mess down south, for example.

The south situation is weird, unpredictable, and will take a while to unravel into anything resembling safety for the participants.

Until you do so, Belgium and Holland are wasted units that must be occupied by the same units they support.  Now, in a more 'cultured' game you might get some mileage out of that observation, but right now they add bulk without adding muscle.<br/><br/>That said, there is an alternate case to be made to Eero's against too much negotiation with the English, even negotiation preceding a stab.  Sometimes it is nice to let an argument boil out of control as a way of giving yourself an excuse to push through with your plans.  The angrier England is, the easier it is to tell everyone else that you don't have a choice, that it has to be a fight to the death between the two of you--sure you'd like to negotiate, but England won't listen to reason.<br/><br/>In this situation, you should get away with it, at least for a while, as the other players have made such a mess of entangling themselves with each other. Really, only the Turks and the Italians have a half-way coherent positions. In this case, developing a culture of the grudge and the need to push through to the bitter end is something you'd like them to mimic. Get them locked in that mindset and they'll all have a much harder time organizing to turn on you, plus you have an excuse to (not so subtly) intimidate them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350865/#Comment_350865" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-07T21:25:08+00:00" title="December  7, 2011  9:25PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great advice, everybody!<br/><br/>I'm doing a lot of these things already:<br/><br/>* My "reports" on the state of the game are read by all the countries (as an unofficial "journalist" of the game), and while these are fairly objective, I do tend to lay out options that are more interesting to me in the long-term for the various countries.

(He failed to follow my recommendations this turn, but also seems to see how that puts him in a weaker position now that he could have had. So we'll see what he'll do next! Russia is a cunning one, unlike most of the others.)<br/><br/>However, it seems there aren't too many long-term tactics for victory beyond "keep everyone occupied with each other, promise them good things in the future".<br/><br/>I brought up this game situation not because I desperately need advice on what to do in this game, but just as an example for a discussion on diplomatic angles a nation in a superior position can take.<br/><br/>For example, one possible tactic: "I have no desire for war. I have always had peace with my neighbours. However, now England has broken that peace by arranging a conspiracy with Germany. We have been, regrettably, forced into war against each other as a result. My other neighbours can expect my full support and continued peace."<br/><br/>The idea being to maintain my status as a "neutral" country as much as possible, saying I won't get involved unless it's necessary for "world peace". (Our group of players is very concerned with good relations and "world peace", as opposed to encouraging and recognizing each country's desire to conquer others.)<br/><br/>What makes this a good tactic (if it is one), is that I can sit back and act peaceful once I've annexed England, without appearing too aggressive to anyone, and then "get involved" when some kind of threat materializes elsewhere on the board. (For example, Turkey growing too strong could provide a reason for me to send fleets into the Mediterranean to help Italy, putting me in position to grab territory and make a run for the solo once I've turned that situation around.)<br/><br/>That's the only alternative I'm seeing at this point to annexing England, and then pushing through into Germany or Scandinavia/StP as quickly as possible after that, as Eero suggests.<br/><br/>Further down the road, I have the "Ride the Tiger" strategy (thanks to Eero), but that's not going to be relevant for a few more years still.<br/><br/>Are there other fruitful approaches you've seen in play or considered in theory?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350915/#Comment_350915" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-08T10:20:03+00:00" title="December  8, 2011 10:20AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good points here, all.<br/><br/>My personal experience in being a dominant player has been that at a weak table it's often most useful to rely on your tactical superiority and just bash your way quickly into victory. This relies on the concept of sociopsychological friction - players take time to come to conclusions, and if the table is on the clock (as is the case around here most of the time), the other players won't have the time to build up a Grand Alliance and succeed in stopping you even if they could have done it given sufficient time. Even without the clock it's usually useful to minimize the window between when you're declared the soloist and the moment when you win. A weak table is one where not all players come to the same conclusions on the same turns, which means that the Grand Alliance only starts up one or two turns <i>after</i> it becomes obvious to the second-strongest player that you're on the brink of victory. These few turns of confusion are "free" time that should be utilized to the utmost, and they will be lost if you trade speed for diplomatical deniability.<br/><br/>The opposite play would be to sneak to victory, but that's more of a play for a median table, one where everybody plays somewhat rationally and you know that the Grand Alliance will have a player who's able to play a whole-board tactical game for the alliance. In that situation it could be useful to try to sneak up into a strategic position that enables you to be closer to soloing than the others realize. (As an example of such positions, England and Italy often need to sneak a fleet through the Gibraltar <i>before</i> their solo bid.) This isn't a high priority in my own play, though, as I don't quite believe that Diplomacy has sufficient depth for deceptive positioning on the merely strategic level. It's often more useful to sow chaos diplomatically and play a straightforward strategic game. Even when playing Italy or Russia I only play passively because the unique weaknesses and strengths of those Powers force me to.<br/><br/>(The above goes for soloing, strictly - midgame attempts to turn the tables as the underdog often benefit from deceptive strategic positioning; in fact, Italy cannot be played effectively without it, I'd say.)<br/><br/>For completeness, I'd say that a strong table is one where the above concept of slow vs. fast play loses its meaning because the other players have a sufficient quality of communication and analysis that they won't be deceived, nor will they hesitate to respond. These players will play a Grand Alliance almost as well as a soloist can play, and they will analyze positions exhaustively, judging your strategic strength near correctly. The key to soloing at that sort of table is diplomatic and deeply strategic, hinging on setting up eg. cat's paw Powers that draw attention and resources, enabling you to come from behind with leverage caused by the fundamental asymmetries of the game board. (I say it this way for a reason: I'm not sure if it's possible to win the game at this level of play on a symmetrical board.)<br/><br/>Looking at the above, I'd say that aggressiveness is the largest differentiating element when playing a weak table: because the weak players are less coordinated, less reliable and tactically inferior, it is generally to your advantage to seize material advantage fast and bargain it into even further advantage, pushing towards the end-game directly. This is not to say that you shouldn't play the full game, using all the tools available, but the generally chaotic play makes many finer strategies unreliable, and if the game comes down to you vs. a Grand Alliance in roughly even positions, you should be able to bring in the win in the tactical crunch. It is rather annoying to be playing a finessed mid-game only to have your ally stab you randomly, ruining both of your chances of victory. These types of situations are best prevented by being quick to rise to a position where you don't need to rely on the competence of the other players as much.<br/><br/>If the above convinces, then the prospective soloist should start planning for his end-game crunch relatively early. Stalemate lines (or rather, defensive corridors) play a role in this consideration, but I'd say that even more important is to plan the geographical lay of the Grand Alliance in a way that causes the alliance to be slow to compile and even slower in fielding its full strength. You should remember that you're the most important player in shaping the GA: it will consist of the Powers you <i>don't</i> eliminate from the board, holding the SCs you don't conquer before the GA comes into being. This foresight should aid you in ensuring that the GA will have Powers that won't be your neighbours, Powers that need to move through each other's land to reach you, and Powers that have perverse incentives against the GA (Powers whose homelands are controlled by other GA Powers, Powers that are almost as strong as you are and therefore potential soloists themselves, etc.).<br/><br/>The above argument is why I'm throwing out strategic end-game goals for you so early: having a strong, land-based Russia will all but ensure that you win against the GA in the endgame, for example. Another important poisonous factor for the GA would be if you can prevent the eastern triangle from resolving; a Turkey stoppered by Austria and Italy is almost useless against any western Power. To ensure that you'll have an easy time against the GA, try to get Russia deep into the Balkans, keep Italy virile against Turkey, and cross the Mun-Ber stalemate line by dominating the Baltic Sea when the time comes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350919/#Comment_350919" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-08T10:50:10+00:00" title="December  8, 2011 10:50AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The latest development appears to be a serious propaganda campaign aimed against France (presumably by England)!<br/><br/>Oh, my.

Encourage England to offer Sweden to Germany for the same purpose, and suggest that instead of demilitarizing Nth you could have Germany build another fleet for neutrally occupying it with the arbitration prizes. Refuse to negotiate without German (or other neutral arbitrator) presence due to having suffered from English lies and broken promises in the past. (Tell each of the English players that the other guy lied to you if they ask about it.) Make this overture in public to gain desired impact.<br/><br/>There's no need whatsoever to go through with giving up Holland, but it's often a good idea to flood negotiations with complex suggestions that project your keen interest in achieving peace even while you prepare for war. Bonus points if England actually falls for it and gives Sweden away. (Germany won't be too mad at you anyway, you can just explain afterwards that it was a ploy to break England and distribute his possessions between you and the German - allies usually accept that you can't tell them everything in advance.) At the very least you can slow down dialogue by insisting that any and all negotiations are witnessed by Germany (or Russia+Italy if Germany is not available).

Player psychology is such that players are much more sensitive to the direction and speed of development than absolute numbers, so by ensuring that your most recent plays have been "setbacks", you project the idea that your empire is struggling and not nearly as dynamic as the other guy's. The best thing is that you get most of the diplomatic advantage of giving away SCs by merely promising to give them up - it's easy to invent reasons for not actually doing it afterwards, and in the meantime you're winning time and giving the rest of the board an overall impression of being a fair guy who's willing to even give up power to ensure board balance. Remember about lying: the only guy who really cares that you lied is the one you lied to, the other players really only see the board developments.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351104/#Comment_351104" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-10T15:02:21+00:00" title="December 10, 2011  3:02PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>Fantastic analysis and ideas. I've been reading and rereading your posts. There's a lot of good stuff in there! And exactly what I was hoping for.<br/><br/>The game I'm involved in is a funny mix of elements: there are a couple of players (mostly myself and England) who greatly enjoy the "roleplaying" elements of the game (e.g. the "NaPAULeon propaganda and my "war journalism"), a couple who just really want to win, and a few who are just playing because their friends said the game was fun.<br/><br/>So it's hard to say right now where it might go next. I'd certainly like to keep pressing my advantage against England, but there's also a funny thing at our table where appearing to be a "peaceful nation" is an important aspect of discussions. So I think I have to be seen as generous enough to consider peace, not to be seen as the aggressor. My current plan is to make my demands for peace with England outrageous enough that hopefully England will refuse and try to fight: and if they accept, of course, it will be almost as good.<br/><br/>I'm probably going to ask for a French fleet in the North Sea, and either London straight up or a trade of London for Liverpool.<br/><br/>Any opinions on dispatching an "ambassador unit" through Munich into Bohemia or something similar?<br/><br/>Eventually, I do hope to be "forced by circumstances" to move fleets into the Mediterranean, perhaps to help Italy against Turkey.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_351307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351307/#Comment_351307" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-12T17:38:34+00:00" title="December 12, 2011  5:38PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The sort of ancillary cultural elements you describe (re: "peaceful nations") are pretty common in Diplomacy. The game being so simple, it encourages players to develop models of play and heuristics of interpretation that are often not much based on the game, but rather the local, accidental culture of play. My own approach regarding this sort of thing is usually to attack the local culture and supplant it with my own - I do not particularly do this because my way of play is superior (although I do think that I have a truer understanding of pure game, and it's more fun when played my way), but rather because it's to my advantage to control the terms of communication by providing the other players with new conceptual frameworks and strange new ideas. By taking up my new viewpoints and ways of thought the other players come into and play my game rather than some other, difficult to control game.<br/><br/>(Why do the other players accept my framing of the game? Because I do active culture war and nobody else phrases the alternatives quite as well, and because I offer tools that work. It makes sense to treat the game the way I do, and the tools I offer to the other players are the same ones I use myself, so it's not a matter of "believing my lies" so much as buying into a system where I have the most experience and therefore an advantage. If one were to agree with my ideas on the game, then my culture war strategy might merely be seen as educational rather than propagandist - we play, I win some, you win some, and in the end you've learned the way I think about and play the game.)<br/><br/>That being said, if you can get England to give up London and/or North Sea by merely talking, you're a better man than I <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Any opinions on dispatching an "ambassador unit" through Munich into Bohemia or something similar?</blockquote>\nI think that mercenary units are, generally speaking, only worthwhile for Powers that do not have prospects for direct action, but do have an excess of force considering mere defense. Usually I only see Italy and Turkey in situations like this. Doing it when you don't have to is a very passive way of play. It's definitely worthwhile if you decide that you are in the situation described: no intent to attack anywhere, and more units than you need for immediate defense. ("Immediate" defense is the length of time it takes for the war to turn into trench warfare. Long-term any mercenaries will be able to come home, should the war persist.)<br/><br/>You know your local environment best, so if you think that delaying your play is to advantage, perhaps that is the case. My fear would be that as the game matures and the other players get their initial ambitions out of their systems, the degree of realism at the table will come to increase, which will bring the other players to turn against you with calm heads. This is just about the deadliest situation, not much to be done but kamikaze judo at that point. I try to avoid this sort of thing by keeping the other players unbalanced and chasing their tails while I myself make steady progress. Nobody can juggle the other players forever, however, which is why even the finessable Powers like Italy have to hurry and make time count.<br/><br/>In general, Diplomacy is a game where enthropy of the game state measures the end of the game. At some point a Power will perish, beginning the middle game, no matter how well you juggle. (If this doesn't happen, then you're either at a dysfunctional table, or it's the fabled 7-way tie.) When you look at the typical game played by a mix of players at different skill levels, the middle game tends to start in ten turns or so. This is not a lot of time when your goal is to enter the new board balance with a superior position that can be immediately leveraged into a shot at soloing! Wasting this time in passive play needs to have very clear reasons, I think.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Eventually, I do hope to be "forced by circumstances" to move fleets into the Mediterranean, perhaps to help Italy against Turkey.</blockquote>\nCertainly, it's a fair direction to advance. Probably not a smart idea to start trouble both north and south at the same time, but which one to start with depends on the diplomacy more than anything else. All other things being equal I favour taking the Nordic area over assaulting Italy because of the massive military advantages you get for cleaning up the north and becoming the only Power with an Atlantic fleet. (Killing Italy as your entrance to the endgame is inferior because behind Italy there's just another naval Power waiting in Turkey.) However, if you trust Germany and/or Russia to dance to your tune, then I guess garrisoning eg. Norway (or Nth) and focusing south is quite doable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351365/#Comment_351365" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-13T10:55:18+00:00" title="December 13, 2011 10:55AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent points, Eero.<br/><br/>I don't have time for a real long post at the moment, but I did want to ask:<br/><br/>It seems that at this point, in this game, the current climate can be used to my advantage.

For example, if the game goes the usual way, you'll soon be pressed to figure out a way to keep Austria alive. (A quickly dying Austria is a very bad signal for western Powers, you should do your best to prevent the eastern triangle from resolving.) A typical way to go about that would be to share your concerns about Austria with eg. Turkey, where you might attempt to convince the Sultan to help Austria survive as an ostensible client state. You would do this by discussing long-term strategic issues ranging from the benefits of keeping Austria alive to the benefits of assaulting Italy "before it's too late" to the benefits of surprising Russia with Austrian aid, etc. As long as you have a superior sense for the game, you will be able to phrase a rational argument for whatever it is you want the other players to do.<br/><br/>So you don't so much apostolize about long-term views of the game, but rather inject these viewpoints into ground-level discussions of concrete tactical choices. The strategic viewpoint is your justification for why you do what you do, and your argument for why others should play the way you want them to play. This tends to work in my experience, as opposing interests do not have an equivalent machine of strategic thought backing them; just like aboroginal religions have rarely stood up to the Christian theological machine in open debate, sentimental and irrational arguments provided by other players to convince each other don't seem to be as effective as pretending to master the entire game with super-rational strategic depth.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>I am definitely trying to educate people in the game, as well, but it seems almost ignorance might be the ticket for me right now. Which particular points might you bring up at this stage in the game?</blockquote>\nWell, I usually concentrate on laying the groundwork for stabs and generally ineffective chaos early on. For example, I would definitely make sure that Austria realizes his precarious position and the interest the Juggernaut has in his quick demise. Similarly, I'd see if Turkey might be drawn into a futile Italian war, out of which I could get him to rebound into a stab without follow-up against Russia a bit later. Russia should turn against Turkey immediately after the first signs of success against Austria happen; an army in Armenia is a beautiful thing. All this stuff is accomplished by laying early groundwork, encouraging bold play from the other players and egging them on to keep up with yourself. People often say that it's not good to be seen as encouraging other people to fight amongst themselves, but I tend to abuse this notion out of my diplomatic relations early: it's not like the game can be won without fighting wars, so I should think that it's better to fight the right ones, and if we had some common interests where we could cooperate I would surely come in and join the fights I'm encouraging at the moment. Ultimately, though, everybody should play according to my strategic geopolitics, which can be easily used to explain why I have to attack your ally instead of attacking your enemy at the moment. Never worry, though, if you do well against your current enemy, we'll be allies at the end-game.<br/><br/>All of this is rational argumentation that relies on substituting a given player's ignorance and existential need for explanatory models with the models I provide. Ignorance is unreliable, and what's worse, one of the simplest heuristics players can have is "attack the leader". (Only "I'm happy to just survive" and "get more SCs" are simpler.) Angry mobs are easy to get up for anybody at all when there's a smidgen of reason for it on the board, which is why I try to lock other players into dogmatic frameworks that help them resist third-party agitation like this. A properly indoctrinated player will be more amenable to betraying the mob to my benefit later on, even if a mob gets to form, as he's not attacking me merely because somebody else told him that I'm in the lead, but because he can read the board himself and see when I've been pushed back sufficiently. In this and many other ways teaching other players brings benefits to you: instead of playing a guessing game that exploits perceived trains of thought in your co-players, you move to a higher level of play where you teach the other players to make evaluations of the board positions, then predict their evaluations and <i>evaluate better</i> than they do.<br/><br/>Oh, one other thing I like to focus on early on: by teaching the other players to appreciate the beauty and morality of correct play you ensure that those players will actually enable you to win the game later on. For example, "Ride the Tiger" was mentioned earlier: that's a line of argumentation that is simply unworkable with players who are not already deep into my particular insanity! Riding the tiger (joining the soloist against the Grand Alliance to build up your own negotiation position and prevent your own elimination later) makes no sense whatsoever for a player who has not accepted the idea that his goal in the game is survival and victory or a sharp draw (in that order). Players with unexamined and irrational values find it very easy to fall from this moral standard to lesser convictions such as "at least I can make sure you lose, too" or "I've already lost, but at least I can help out this guy who hasn't yet stabbed me once". Players like this are very troublesome for you later in the game, as they will often not see a route to victory for themselves, and will therefore play a nihilist game that will more likely than not be directed against you. Teach the correct morals early and often, and you'll find that the other players will play their own game instead of playing against yours.<br/><br/>(To clarify, I truly think that "Ride the Tiger" and similar seemingly radical ideas are correct play and not merely cruel ploys - if there wasn't truth there, it would not convince others reliably. The reason for why the player who decides to ride me in the end-game ends up losing is that he doesn't have a sufficient tactical understanding of the game to turn against the soloist early enough. It is entirely fair to say that my indoctrination of the other players is directed at making them play the same way I do so as to enable me to better predict their play. My success will then emerge from the fact that I play the tactical game better than the opposition. If I don't, then I lose.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>(Also, a new development: a seasoned player is taking over for Germany, who gave up on the game out of frustration. He's smart and aggressive, and likes betraying people for short-term benefit. I have a slight edge on him tactically, however.)</blockquote>\nThe sparky, aggressive players are dangerous unless tempered with iron discipline. In my experience such players fear a wilting defeat more than misinvestment, which means that they'll attack you just to try out whether it might bear fruit. My impression is that I most often get attacked by three types of players in Diplomacy: players who have a handle on the game, scared and chaotic players who attack randomly to alleviate their existential pressures (just to do something, anything, is what I mean), and bold newbies who make a brave bid at surprising me (perhaps because they judge that it's easier to deal with me early). This new Germany sounds like the third class, so were I you I'd ensure that he faces constant pressure from the east. As long as he has an issue to address in there, he's not plotting about moving to Ruhr, but will rather court your friendship.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351751/#Comment_351751" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-16T20:54:06+00:00" title="December 16, 2011  8:54PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>Thank you for that informative and well-written post.

Some things, though -- and again, I apologize for being brief, I'm running from one event to another right now!<br/><br/>1. I'm not sure I have the confidence you have about the Russian theatre:<br/><br/>Yes, I can take either Norway or Sweden in the Spring. However, it seems very likely to me that by the Fall there will be another fleet in the theatre (in BoT), which incidentally also gives Norway a place to retreat. Now I still effectively have four units in the theatre, but so does he, and Germany can cut one of my supports (Nth, which is not useful as an attack if Norway is mine in the Spring). It seems he would have good odds of taking it back in the Fall, and meanwhile we might lose Denmark and/or Holland.<br/><br/>While I recognize the offensive advantage I have in the arena (I have little under threat), I'm sure Russia and Germany will be coordinating against me 100% (as they did for the last two years). At that point the situation seems closer to stalemate, and I have potential security threats in Scotland and perhaps even in the Mediterranean.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, it's likely that Russia will gain a build next year (Vienna), and I would be VERY surprised if he doesn't build again in StP. Foolish? Yes. But that's how he's played the whole game, he doesn't seem too likely to change his tune just yet. I think he'll have to learn the hard way.<br/><br/>By my eye, I can't really afford to retreat London to Wal and Lvp, I need it to defend the Nth. Am I wrong in that?<br/> <br/>2. The memetic warfare you're suggesting is all very sensible. However, I've being putting it to use 100%, and to the best of my ability, but it seems to have no effect. I've said the very things you're outlining here many times in this game. I have talks with these players, they listen and nod and look completely convinced, but the moves never change. It's very weird!<br/><br/>For instance, last "year", I sat with Russia and I pointed out to him how exposed he was in the South (at the time he had only one unit South of Livonia, except for  Budapest). He told me afterwards: "Oh, man, you were talking and talking and it was so distracting because I was just trying to work out how I could help Germany disband your fleet in Skagerrak.<br/><br/>And, in fact, the only reason I won Denmark last year was due to their misunderstanding of the convoy rules: they thought an attack on Nth would cut the convoy, so they screwed up. (Although they probably couldn't have done any better than they did.)<br/><br/>As another example, Turkey and I have been discussing a Turkish attack on Russia since 1902. We've looked at maps I've found of Turkish victories (which ALL begin with an invasion of Russia), and discussed the necessity of it. Last year he even came to me and said, "When do you think I should make the stab? How much longer should I wait?" And I said, "Now's your chance! Russia will be building next year, the window will close quickly." He's taking me seriously, I can tell. But in the game? Not a sign.<br/><br/>So... it's strange to me. I wouldn't agree with someone else's strategic summary of the board unless I could gain some significant advantage by making them think that I did. What does Turkey think he has to gain by pretending he agrees with my logic? Or is he agreeing but just shy to make the move?<br/><br/>3. The idea of forcing the army in Tuscany to disband has been floated. However, I don't see the advantage. It can't do any harm there: effectively we're keeping one German unit away from the action elsewhere, and I don't really see the possibility of making too much more progress since it will take another turn just to get back into the position we have now. In addition, based on what I know of the German player, I fully expect him to attack Tus-Pie. Stupid? Yeah, but annoying if we try to crush him. <br/><br/>So, I'm thinking maybe we should just pen him in there, useless and out of the action (an extra army or fleet in Berlin would be a substantial advantage for him in that theatre).<br/><br/>It seems like forcing a disband doesn't actually do much when it requires us to retreat from our position of strength.<br/><br/>4. Sometimes it's very hard for me parse your advice, when I can't tell if you're talking about your actual opinion of the board or a diplomatic tactic that might be to my advantage. For example:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Emphasize that Russia taking Vienna is actually an awful move, as it weakens the already completely impotent Germany while giving Russia a SC he can't maintain.</blockquote>\nReally?<br/><br/>I'll have to get to work on some more propaganda before I run out of time completely!<br/><br/>Happy Friday!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355053">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355053/#Comment_355053" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-19T20:24:09+00:00" title="January 19, 2012  8:24PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From my own personal experience, the learning curve of Diplomacy is not contained in a single game.

For whatever reason, this one had a lot more "surprises" for me than most of the others.<br><br>Much of the game is developing more or less as you suggest: I gave the Turk the Tri-Bud, Bul-Rum attack plan a few days ago, and I think he may go for it. If Russia does not move to defend in the Spring, this gives Turkey Sev and War or Mos within another year, and then the remaining Russian SC by the next year. (Almost no one else can interfere with this development, unless Germany decides to run away from his defense to stop Turkey... which I'm pretty sure he would never do.)<br/><br/>In the meantime, I think I've convinced the Russian to reinforce by moving Sil-Gal-Rum, and building a fleet in Sevastopol by disbanding his fleet Clyde (with my help, of course). I've also recommended Boh-Vie, for one additional build for defense as well as to defend Bud on the following move, if necessary (via, say, Vie-Bud and Rum-Bud).<br/><br/>I'll have to wait and see which one of them goes for it first. But if they both go for it, I'm worried Turkey will abort immediately and we'll be back to the status quo. Oh, well, hopefully by that point I'll have Kiel and also have delayed the Italian situation from progressing for a bit.<br/><br/>The various options for Austrian redevelopment are very interesting, and very promising. I'm constantly trying to do what I can to get that to happen: we will see if I can manage it this time or not.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358200/#Comment_358200" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-07T11:27:56+00:00" title="February  7, 2012 11:27AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Fortify your German border so Germany has no chance of attacking you whatsoever, then continue improving your position on the flanks for your solo bid.

Scotland/England (they proudly reverted to England for their last year among the living) pushed Russia out of St. Petersburg in exchange for my mercy for a turn (I gave them back Sweden while I took Norway). Meanwhile, I told Italy I would be attacking Tunis but had no other ambitions against her. She let me take it, and retreated to defend her remaining Centres while fighting to retake Venice (unsuccessfully).<br/><br/>In the middle, things were fun. As expected, the Allies (Russia, Turkey, and Germany) made as strong an attack as they could on Tyrolia.<br/><br/>The Games Master did something funny: when he read out everyone's orders each turn, he saved mine (France's) for last. This was very entertaining, because I outmaneuvered them every single turn, and comically so. On the first move, I side-stepped by retreating Tyrolia to Munich, and slipping into Prussia and Silesia for an attack on Warsaw. Warsaw, of course, was impregnable: occupied by Turkish army, with Russia in Livonia, and more Turks in Ukraine, Moscow, and Galicia (as well as Germany in Bohemia).<br/><br/>On my next move, I once again side-stepped their attack, moving Prussia-Livonia, and retreating Silesia-Prussia, allowing their next massed attempted strike (to crush Silesia) to close on empty air.<br/><br/>After that, I could simply attack Livonia-St. Petersburg and claim Sweden to win the game. Their next attempted attack was a move to Piedmont, but, of course, at that point the game was done. Nevertheless, I avoided that one as well, by moving to Tuscany, which added to the laughter around the table: in the last four moves of the game, I didn't have a single bounce or unsuccessful move anywhere on the board.<br/><br/>Turkey used his last move to screw over his allies, destroying Austria-Hungary and Germany by invading Venice, Vienna, and Trieste.<br/><br/>Because the Turkish forces were rearranging themselves to move into the Mediterranean, I even got into the Ionian.<br/><br/>The final position, Fall 1912:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://ihousenews.pbworks.com/f/Fall%201912.png"/><br/><br/>Thanks for the advice, those following along!<br/><br/>I suppose the takeaway lesson is: when you're "doing too well", just try to keep on going. Play good tactics and hope you can pull off a victory before the others can get into position to stop you. There's not much in the way of a different diplomatic angle, except maybe to downplay the strength of your own position.<br/><br/>However, I did have quite a lot of success in using my superior position to support various allies (Scotland, Italy, Germany on one occasion), even allowing them to build new units, which garnered me some trust and made my advance overall seem less aggressive. In the end, Italy was so grateful she didn't even try to stop me from taking Tunis!<br/><br/>This was an incredibly successful game for me: I never had to disband a single unit, never lost ground, never really lost a single battle (even for position), for beginning to end. I don't expect to see this kind of game ever again. (In particular, if I ever play with these people again, I have little doubt they will do everything they can to crush me immediately, as soon as the game begins. At the same time, however, I have really developed a reputation as a trustworthy and honest player: for two games in a row now, I've kept every single promise I've made and only given good advice. It will be interesting to see how these two factors work together if there will be another game next year, although I suspect fear and the desire for revenge will win out!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365925/#Comment_365925" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T08:43:03+00:00" title="March  8, 2012  8:43AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (By the way: the French army in Spain is kind of a joke.

So I sent that unit to Spain for a "vacation". We'll see what Russia says about that when he returns.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365938/#Comment_365938" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T09:15:53+00:00" title="March  8, 2012  9:15AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interestingly Turkey ended up playing a center game that leaves you a serious opening there.

Play good tactics and hope you can pull off a victory before the others can get into position to stop you. There's not much in the way of a different diplomatic angle, except maybe to downplay the strength of your own position.<br/></blockquote>\nThat's pretty much my opinion, too. Specifically, I believe in chaos in Diplomacy: if you go into a leading position with the assumption that the others will align against you perfectly, then you're doing the opposition's playing for them. They never need to actually step up and play a successful defense if you decide to never attack because you see a way for them to defend against you. Better to take even the long shots and see if the opposition has what it takes to stop you.<br/><br/>In your specific game you had plenty of suboptimal play caused by players still being misled by notions of honor and intrigue that are unsupported by the board positions. To me it seems like your victory was primarily caused by the other players being more concerned with words than tactical reality; this enabled you to choose only good wars simply by not betraying the players who should have attacked you. Perhaps the next time around some or all of the players will have less illusions. It'd be nice if instead of blind revenge motivations they took a good hard look at their own play and tried to improve; trying to vainly increase your odds of success by killing the "good players" first is like going to a poker table with double the cash of the other guys: it's the ultimately futile play of an inferior player.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365943/#Comment_365943" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T09:20:41+00:00" title="March  8, 2012  9:20AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agreed, Eero.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Interestingly Turkey ended up playing a center game that leaves you a serious opening there.
