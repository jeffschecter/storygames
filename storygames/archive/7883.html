The article says he "assaulted a police officer," which sounds irredeemably bad, but of course such an assault <i>could</i> have consisted of belligerently and obstreperously wagging a finger in the officer's face.  I don't say that that's what happened, but the account provided by the article is designed to sway us by working on our emotions rather than our reasoning faculties.<br><br>Here's an instance where concision serves to obscure understanding rather than enhance it. And of course you presented the item with no caveat about its provenance ("Here's a view from the other side") so anyone who took the link's account at face value might be led not to investigate further and "decide for themselves" but to have their minds made up for them. We can go round and round about how likely that is, but shouldn't the fact that your seemingly "objective" account was created by a PR firm that gets paid to discredit environmentalists and other public policy advocates be front and center in any citation of their work?                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200137/#Comment_200137" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-02T11:55:26+00:00" title="April  2, 2009 11:55AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 2, 2009 11:55AM by Brand_Robins.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Shouldn't the fact that we're on the net induce people to not take anything at stated face value? <br><br>Alas, I suppose not. <br><br>And I suppose the net is to blame for thread drift as well. <br><br/>John, <br/><br/>What gets me about the post, makes me laugh, is his "I can has no cheesburger" humor lines.

Because that's what this whole prisons-and-rpgs thing reminds me of: people speculate about whether they'd be willing to play with a former prisoner, advocate against teaching prisoners to roleplay, hope fervently that they don't ever have to meet a former prisoner... awfully dehumanizing, I don't think I've ever encountered this sort of attitudes around here. This seems to fit with the large prison populations USA keeps, though. I feel sorry for the guy who's served his sentence but now can't find anybody to play with because decent people won't give him the time of day anymore now that he's joined this mythical criminal subspecies.<br/><br/>And to answer Scott: I certainly hope that I'd still be able to deal with other people as people if I myself ended up in prison, and I hope that it wouldn't matter a whit whether I was innocent or in prison for a reason. Your whole question weirds me out with that innocence-attendum; do you think that a person gets contaminated for associating with others who have broken a law and therefore should only play with criminals if they are themselves criminals as well, or what? Should an innocent person sent to prison avoid associating with the other people in there because those others are Evil?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_200145">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200145/#Comment_200145" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-02T12:29:46+00:00" title="April  2, 2009 12:29PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 2, 2009 12:37PM by Brand_Robins.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: scottdunphy</cite>Now here's the question that raises: If you were locked up and believed yourself innocent - pure as rain! - how long would it take you to start up a game with "Stabby and Knifey" just to get your RPG fix?

Which is ironic considering how many Americans ended up here as an alternative to jail.... <br/><br/>So yes, you're reading it right, and yes, it is a pretty common thing.<br/><br/>Edit: Oh, story time!<br/><br/>So a while back I was talking about playing Zero At the Bone with some folks online. And in that game, as with Spione, there is this part where you're supposed to take the worst thing someone you know has done and put it in a hat. The sins are then drawn out of a hat and given to the various characters. <br/><br/>I put down "Murder." Because, well, yes. I did in fact have a guy I used to work with, whom I used to grab lunch with and talk politics, who had me over to his house a couple of times -- in other words a friend -- who had done 20 years in jail for 2 murders. (And when I knew him he was working with No Guns to help ease gang activity in LA.) <br/><br/>The rest of the group then has a real hard time with this. They can't believe that anyone in our circle of educated, middle class roleplayers actually knew someone, personally, who was a murderer. Impossible! Like, despite the fact that the game tells you not to get caught up on that part, it pretty much ended the game before it started.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy" title="scottdunphy"><img alt="scottdunphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy">scottdunphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200173/#Comment_200173" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-02T13:52:16+00:00" title="April  2, 2009  1:52PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 6, 2009 8:14PM by scottdunphy.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            -                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_200180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200180/#Comment_200180" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-02T14:18:11+00:00" title="April  2, 2009  2:18PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not judging anything, I'm just offering the interpretation I got from reading that rpgsite thread and asking whether I was completely off the rails with it.

And no, I really can't relate to the idea that simply being criminal (with no further qualification) changes you into a creature to be shunned by society - if anything we should offer our support and attention to people with a criminal past, as doing anything else just encourages them to continue with the only lifestyle we allow them.

The Finnish prison system is pretty strongly oriented towards reintegrating prisoners to society, so the normal attitude at least where I've been has been that people need to get a new chance after serving their sentence. Then there are the different moral reasons for people to end up in prison - it's far from obvious that your crime is actually something your community will frown upon; every year Finns go to prison for dodging mandatory military service, for example. Crimes like that and internet piracy are good examples of things that it would be ridiculous to ostracize people for...<br/><br/>All in all we have a pretty peaceful and dull country, or that's my impression. Not many prisoners in general compared to USA, so perhaps it's just easy for us to handle these issues magnanimously. I imagine that I'd have a different attitude if the big cities were a constant battleground between gangs and so on, like the situation seems to be in the USA. The types of crimes seem somehow less severe, too: Americans are always talking about these serial killers and child molesters, while the sort of criminals I mostly meet are drunk drivers, repeat offence brawlers, wife-beaters and the sort. I don't know if the criminals simply are more crazy in the large urban centers of America or if the media just paints a different picture.<br/><br/>But that's sort of a side issue, the point I really wanted to make with my observation wasn't to compare societies, but to question the idea criminal exceptionalism, especially the sort that elevates roleplaying into something special in relation to convicts, who are after all people just like everybody here. My dislike for dehumanizing criminals is sort of a side-issue, no reason to let that steal attention. And who knows? American criminals might be just that crazy, I haven't lived there and seen the reality.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_200799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

I don't know if this guy was capable of child molestation, but I certainly wouldn't have taken the chance or had him over if I had known the nature of his crimes.</blockquote>\nWell, I only know the details you've shared, but a lot of people go to jail charged with "child pornography" under some rather innocuous circumstances. I understand a great many of our "sex offenders" are 17-year-olds guilty of sharing naked photos of themselves with their also-17-year-old lovers. I've also heard of incidents with people who just download a lot of porn online, get a few photos of girls who are maybe at some point said they were 18 and nobody bothered to check much more into it than that, or maybe even knew they were 17, but they wanted in and nobody was going to bother with it. So, "child pornography" covers a host of sins, all the way from a dangerous sexual offender to some not altogether uncommon possibilities. Again, I don't know the details of the case with your friend, but the charge alone might not reveal as much as many people would assume, so it's possible from the details you've shared that your friends didn't say anything about it because the crime was much more benign than the charge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_201012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy" title="scottdunphy"><img alt="scottdunphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy">scottdunphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201012/#Comment_201012" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-06T16:45:43+00:00" title="April  6, 2009  4:45PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 6, 2009 8:12PM by scottdunphy.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            -                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_201014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201014/#Comment_201014" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-06T16:52:29+00:00" title="April  6, 2009  4:52PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>Jesus, are there people who actually don't know anyone who has been to prison?<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben</blockquote>\nYep. <br/><br/>Or, maybe more accurately, there are people who don't know that they know anyone who has been in prison.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_201024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201024/#Comment_201024" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-06T18:04:05+00:00" title="April  6, 2009  6:04PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: scottdunphy</cite><br/>Yes, but it wasn't a posting about all criminals or crimes.

Your response to Eero, for example, was pure nationalist reaction. The fact that you sprang from activism to pedophilia is so stiff with received ideology I can barely restrain myself from deconstructing it.<br/><br/>As a father and a teacher, I'll tell you this: don't worry about the convicted pedophiles.
