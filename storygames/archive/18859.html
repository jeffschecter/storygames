I'm planning on a game roughly based on the <b>everymanHYBRID</b> slenderman youtube series and am looking to crowdsource some of the character's questionnaire questions.<br/><br/>The Character concepts I have are as follows:<br/>The Watcher - Always filming, prefers not to involve themselves physically<br/>The Angry One - More perceptive to the supernatural. Collects knives<br/>The Punching Bag - Lots of painful loss in their past, probably more to come. Puts up a good front to their friends<br/>The Disbeliever - Everything can be explained logically, nothing strange going on<br/>The Investigator - Driven to find out the truth, usually doesn't think of the consequences<br/>The Experianced One - Has delt with these things before and gotten away. Would prefer to leave this all alone<br/><br/>The characters are all going to be friends in their early 20's. Some may be siblings. In general they're all "out of the house" and rooming together in some configuration or another (the details arn't important) The exception is the Punching Bag, he/she's lost both parents (maybe under mysterious circumstances) and the house fell to them. <br/><br/>All of the characters were also involved in filming a youtube show at some point before the game. That's how they first encounter the strangeness and they decide to change gears and at the urging of the Watcher begin to document what's happening to them.<br/><br/>So there you have it. There's the premis and the rough outline of the characters. Any good leading questions to plop on their character questionnaire?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422303/#Comment_422303" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-02T08:37:54+00:00" title="October  2, 2013  8:37AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right off the top of my head, for the Disbeliever: "What seemingly supernatural occurrence did you have to rationalize away once in your life?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wes_the_mad" title="Wes_the_mad"><img alt="Wes_the_mad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/649/nNGKML0VGFY5M.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wes_the_mad">Wes_the_mad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422317/#Comment_422317" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-02T12:02:24+00:00" title="October  2, 2013 12:02PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice!

With the "break in" and all the strange production troubles, why have you guys decided to keep making the youtube series?<br/>2. Your fans continue to comment that there are videos on your channel that you never uploaded, that you have no memory of filming, and that you cannot see. What's your feelings on the matter?<br/>3. You all seem to be comming down with colds right around the same time lately. Why do you think the medications aren't helping?<br/>4. What is your fondest memory of the hike you all went on up in the state forest last summer?<br/>5. You've had strange dreams of being watched while in the forest. Why haven't you told any of the others about it?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo" title="w00hoo"><img alt="w00hoo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/395/nB2PXS15U6BFQ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo">w00hoo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422677/#Comment_422677" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-10T02:42:17+00:00" title="October 10, 2013  2:42AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As these are obviously questions that are answered individually I'd reword 1 a little (just remove the word 'guys' probably) and possibly 4, or I'd have them all discuss what they are putting down for 4 together before they choose their bit (and likewise 1). <br/><br/>Just to make sure there's no big disconnects, specifically with 1, if one player decides they've all chosen to keep doing the series out of respect for her dead sister and nobody else knows the dead sister exists it could easily lead to a stumbling point during play...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
