But if there's something you don't understand, please ask questions and me or someone else here will answer.)</small><br/><br/>I've said before how much I love game systems where there's just a certain chance to succeed, a certain chance to fail, and that's it. No four outcomes, no fail forward, just "Can I do it? Oh, I guess not."<br/>But since I'm procrastinating on prep and thinking I want to make Dungeons and Dragons play a bit more like Dungeon World, I was reading the houserules at the back of <i>The Seclusium of Orphone of the Three Visions</i> and they remind me a lot of Apocalypse World. They are specifically for LotFP, where your mod is usually between -1 and +1.<br/><br/>I looked up the optional rules for partial success in the Dungeon Master's Guide. It suggested a difficulty class of 10 for one thing happening and 15 for another, better thing happening. Seems like a clean enough way to express it with no subtraction (i.e. "If you make your roll by so-and-so much, this happens"). But that means the partial successes will only happen 25% of the time. Looking at the particular examples they had in the DMG, that seemed appropriate. (When talking to a queen, DC 10 to not get thrown in the dungeon, DC 15 to get her help.)<br/>But looking at the examples in Dungeon World and in <i>The Seclusium of Orphone of the Three Visions</i> (and looking back to my own memories of playing Dungeon World and Apocalypse World), the partial successes felt like they happened like a little over 41% of the time, with a "full success" only happening like a sixth of the time or so.<br/><br/>So that suggests that the difficulty classes for the two results should be eight steps from each other, to replicate that. Most of D&amp;D seem to be calculated around having +7 in the areas where you're the most proficient, which you get at level five or so. +4 in the ability, +3 on the proficiency bonus. I am enamored with D&amp;D's new policy of having fixed difficulty, that doesn't escalate by level like it did in the previous edition and I want to keep that. That means first level characters will have a little bit of a harder time and later level characters will have an easier time. This matches Apocalypse World.<br/>Although... in Apocalypse World, you have +2 in your most proficient areas in the beginning, and at the end you pretty much have +3 in everything (or you're in a muddy grave singing the rust song).<br/><br/>At +2, that means you get a partial success on a natural 5 through 7 roll (still just over 41%) and you get a complete success on a natural 8 through 12 roll (also just over 41%).<br/>That suggests in D&amp;D terms that the DC for "partial success" should be 12 and the DC for "full success" should be 20.<br/>For simple pass/fail checks, I'll still use 15. This is only when I have a "move" available a la DW or <i>The Seclusium of Orphone of the Three Visions</i>.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446696/#Comment_446696" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-16T11:43:21+00:00" title="July 16, 2015 11:43AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 16, 2015 11:43AM by 2097.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's presuming a typical bonus of +7, like in the fifth edition of Dungeons and Dragons.
