Can there be a correlation between these two reactions? Could it have something to do with a lot of us choosing an escapist stance in role-playing games, that includes an emotional distance that is not healthy? And by "emotional distance" I also include a distance to our fellow players; we wear masks, to mask the fact that we do not really trust each other in the game. It makes us enjoy killing living things, while we abhor the showing of emotions and giving comfort to each other ...<br/><br/>In my world (and fantasy) emotions are fun! I love playing fantasy-rpgs, but I do not find it very interesting to play around with emotionally empty elements.

It depends on what kind of game the players want to play. Clearly, we can define boundaries that the second one crosses which the first one doesn't, and vice versa.<br/><br/>What both rolls have in common is that they introduce a fictional element, and do not require the player's agreement. One way in which they differ, as <a href="/forums/profile/w176">@w176</a> indicates, is that one addresses the body of the PC, and the other addresses their power of choice. That might make enough of a difference for some players. This isn't the distinction that hits my squick button personally, though.<br/><br/>Another way in which they differ, is that one element has a violent theme, and the other has a sexual theme.<br/><br/>Someone who is disturbed by violence but has an open attitude to sexual themes might be disturbed by a graphic stabbing, but not by a seduction.<br/><br/>On the other hand, someone who is disturbed by unwelcome and un-agreed-to sexualizing of social interactions might be disturbed by the second move, even though the fictional situation it describes is a consensual one, because the theme has been introduced to the game without their agreement as a player. This is where my squick boundary lies, personally. (I'm perfectly happy with AW's special moves, because those require the mutual agreement of the players.)<br/><br/>As long as players understand the moves of the game before they agree to play it, what kinds of rolls can come up or are likely to come up, I don't see a general problem with games that include either kind of rule. But I think no one should be surprised if there are people who are okay playing a game that includes rolls like the first one but not okay playing games that include rolls like the second.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390082/#Comment_390082" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-13T14:44:21+00:00" title="September 13, 2012  2:44PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From a design perspective, agnostic of the rest of the system (I KNOW I KNOW) let's say there's a skill like Persuasion that allows any character, PC or NPC, to make a contested roll against say, Willpower.  If the roll is successful for the persuader, the persuaded is inclined to do the thing the persuader wants.  Is that okay?  Is that expected or normal?  Can one character make another character do a thing they might otherwise not want to do (provided the cost for success - a high number to roll, some price to pay, etc) using a skill?<br/><br/>It happens to NPCs all the time (hey, I want to make the shopkeeper give me a discount!  *roll roll roll*) is it different when it happens to "your character"?

We lean on contemporary myths about personal agency, despite two hundred years of social science quietly chucking at the notion, whether that's in sociology, psychology, neuro-science, economics or political science.

Faced with sudden and disturbing situations people often lock up, scream in high pitched voices, flee blindly and abandon friends and loved ones. Sometimes they get violent but without discipline or control. They often react in illogical ways because the logical part of their brain has been overwhelmed by the instinctual part. What they don't do the vast majority of the time is go into Die Hard Bruce Willis mode.<br/><br/>Sometimes in an rpg (okay, a lot of the time) we're playing that Die Hard character and controlled and deliberate action under fire makes sense. But just playing average folks the action hero structure of so many rpgs seems out of place. If there's a game out there that does niche protection based around how much control of their character's decision making a player has in different types of situations I'd love to see it.

That was a bad choice of words. It becomes a problem though when the people involved in the game have different expectations about how role-playing has an impact on the fiction. <br/><br/>This actually goes back to the original question of why seduction (an inherently social, and therefore role-playing heavy activity) would be treated differently than combat (a traditionally less role-playing oriented activity usually associated with lots of dice rolling). In some games, you roll Charisma to see if you can get a discount with a merchant. In other games, the character's 'charisma' is represented by the player and their ability to barter convincingly with the GM. There are fun points to each side, and often the line is blurred and the GM takes into account both the dice and the player's own personality. It mostly depends on the group and the GM I think, since one is left to the dice and taken out of the hands of the GM while the other relies on GM opinion. Combat on the otherhand has been traditionally mechanics and dice heavy, so a player mostly accustomed to orthodox games would be more comfortable with dice inflicting wounds than determining how their character behaves socially, which impacts their role-playing and not the numbers on their character sheet.\n<blockquote>I remember an idea I had a while ago for a game where everything was basically the AW PC seduction mechanic: A really skilled fighter couldn't automatically stab your guy, but they could give you a large mechanical incentive to accept that your character had been stabbed.<br/></blockquote>\nI had a very similar thought a while back and completely forgot about it until you mentioned that right there.

If I may elaborate:<br/><br/>On the topic of rules, principles, and agency: The game in question was In Nomine, in which characters play angels and demons. This scenario involved a demon using a totally non-supernatural skill (Seduction) against an angelic PC. In Nomine's rules are quite clear (though we didn't recall this at the time) that Seduction CANNOT be used against PCs; players always get the final say in what their characters feel or believe, as long as they have control of their own mind. Of course, you aren't always in control of your own mind. If this NPC had used a supernatural power to force the PC to fall in love with her (which she definitely could have done if the NPC had been built that way), the player would not have been mad about the loss of agency any more than he'd be upset about losing in a combat scene. My players are great about rolling with the punches whenever demons manipulate them, and roleplaying accordingly. <br/><br/>This is not an unusual principle of game design or gameplay: Apocalypse World is a great example of this being codified in the rules, as there are totally different versions of the Seduce and Manipulate skill as used on PCs versus NPCs, and the one for PCs lets players DECIDE whether they're persuaded/seduced/manipulated/whatever. Anybody can shoot or stab you without your permission, steal from you without permission, or spit in your food without permission, but nobody can definitely say "this is what you think/feel/believe." That's not a distinction between sex and violence; it is a distinction between "things external to my mind" and "things internal to my mind." Some games ARE built such that emotional manipulation is mechanically indistinguishable from physical conflict, but this wasn't one of them.<br/><br/>On the topic of sex making the player uncomfortable: Yeah, that still would've happened even if it were the result of a supernatural power. But I think that says more about my friend's GMing style and my other friend's sense of personal boundaries than it does about anything generalizable in terms of game mechanics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390164/#Comment_390164" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-13T20:43:43+00:00" title="September 13, 2012  8:43PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, a brief follow-up to address the example from the original post: <br/><br/>It is a false comparison to draw a parallel between "the spy seduces your secrets out of you" and "the orc stabs you, you bleed and might die." The former scenario presumes how a character would react; the latter does not. For this to be parallel, the latter scenario would have to be something like, "the orc stabs you, and you grab a nearby child to shield you from its next attack." In most games I play, at least, I'd say the player would be within her rights to say in these scenarios, "Uh, no. No, that's not what I'd do at all." That's the GM overstepping a boundary and narrating what PCs do, which is just as problematic as a player overstepping a boundary and narrating what NPCs do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_390168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390168/#Comment_390168" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-13T21:51:34+00:00" title="September 13, 2012  9:51PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 13, 2012 9:53PM by TomasHVM.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a strange discussion.

Saying what happens to a character is one thing. Forcing a character to do something that the player does not consent to is another. Think about it. That's all a player has control of in most games. Take that away from them and they might as well not be playing.<br/><br/>Making seduction work on a Pc is not that hard to do.

Obviously there's a difference between theoretical violence and theoretical sexual compulsion in an fictional / game environment inured to violent action (hell, driven by it).  What interests me is where people draw the line and how the mechanisms of play reflect that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
