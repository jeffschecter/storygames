One had never played it before, and was very taken by it - I think he described the session as "the best game ever". But fantasy's much more his thing (and mine, really) than space adventure. Has anyone run Inspectres in a fantasy setting? I've seen UnSpeakable and InSpace, but no fantasy hacks. A web search turns up nothing.<br/><br/>(I read Donjon at some point, and that has some commonalities, but it's much, much more complex and clunky)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414846/#Comment_414846" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-28T13:33:04+00:00" title="May 28, 2013  1:33PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't done so, but I had the same thought when I first played it.  I was gonna call the game "Speak With Dead" and the framing story would be that the PCs had all died eventually, somehow (maybe in this adventure, maybe not) and were now being interrogated by a necromancer about their trip into the Tomb of Horrors or a similarly terrifying dungeon.<br/><br/>It certainly doesn't seem like it would be hard to make a fantasy hack.  <br/><br/><br/><br/>(If you let the players narrate victories and partial successes in <a href="http://mightyatom.blogspot.com/2012/06/world-of-dungeons.html" rel="nofollow">World of Dungeons</a>, then that would play mighty similarly to a fantasy InSpectres.  I think.  Maybe.  You might want to port over the confessional mechanic if you did.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414848/#Comment_414848" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-28T14:28:04+00:00" title="May 28, 2013  2:28PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 28, 2013 2:31PM by Rickard.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It shouldn't be hard to create a hack.
