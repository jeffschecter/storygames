Nixon's game, <a href="http://open.crngames.com/src/the-face-of-angels.html" rel="nofollow">The Face of Angels</a>, last night at the weekly Story Games Boston event at Pandemonium Books.  There were four players (Robert, Eve, Erik, Jonathan) with myself as "The World" and we had a pretty great time despite rushing forward (and only making it to Act 2).  You can read <a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/2008/02/21/the-face-of-angels/#comments" rel="nofollow">Jonathan Walton's post</a> about the game for his perspective.<br/><br/>I wanted to post here to talk a bit about the game and invite comments from Clinton or others who have had experience with it.<br/><br/>I really enjoy the strong focus that the Act structure of the game produces.  Additionally the central conceit of the game (teenagers + superpowers = what happens next?) resonates powerfully with me.<br/><br/>There was some of the "bumpiness" of play can be attributed to inexperience with the system, as I was running it for the first time.  The issues of narration that Jonathan mentions arose I believe because I failed to properly cede narration rights to the winner of the conflict.  Part of this was insufficiently close reading of the text (I wasn't certain who had narration rights).  And part of this was my own desire to close the conflict with vivid description as well as a measure of impatience with players when they were uncertain about how to proceed - I preferred to choose a direction and go and this clearly wasn't always a positive thing.  Playing the game in a different circumstance where were were not limited in time and could expect to play the game over several sessions might alleviate this issue.<br/><br/>The other issue that wasn't entirely clear was how best to involve the characters' relationships in a conflict and whether players other than the "owner" could play them in a scene (although we were clear that the "owner" had final narrative authority over the relationships).  I feel that another session, with everyone reviewing the rules, would prove a lot smoother and help build group consensus on this matter.<br/><br/>However, the one issue that I left the game wrestling most with is the negotiated stakes - essentially the player initiating conflict declares a win and loss stake and the responding player can revise one of those or accept it and get to declare the conflict length.  One the one hand, I love the "bidding" aspect of it where, as a responder, you can escalate the loss stake just to force the initiator to reconsider what he's willing to risk.  And I love that there is a benefit for accepting someones stakes (e.g. I might accept bad stakes if I have a single great card and choose to declare the conflict length of 1 so I have a good chance of winning).<br/><br/>But I also felt it made asking for input difficult - after all revising a stake is a tactical choice, so do I want to permit the other player input into my initial stake?<br/><br/>Also, it touched on the issue of "play before play" - where we've already established the viable outcomes before addressing who wins.  I'm divided in opinion as to whether this is a big issue or not for this game.  Or whether it's an artifact of some misinterpretation of the rules on my part.<br/><br/>Anyone have any guidance or contrasting experience to share regarding this game?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack" title="amnesiack"><img alt="amnesiack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1012/830711303_f5d26761f6_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack">amnesiack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128837/#Comment_128837" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T17:46:18+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  5:46PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just finished reading this a couple of days ago, in anticipation of playing it with some friends soon.<br/><br/>My (unverified) guess about how to fix the "play before play" issue:  make stakes broad and actions concrete.  So, you might propose: "If I win, you're hurt and embarrassed" and "If you win, you're unhurt and everyone there dislikes me".  Then, concrete actions, based on the cards you play, might be things like "I punch you", "I dodge", "I trip you and you fall in the mud", or "I call you out for being a bully."  That way, while you know where you're going, the cards tell you how you get there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128861">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128861/#Comment_128861" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T18:31:35+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  6:31PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lukas,<br/><br/>That is *exactly* how it should work.<br/><br/>- Clinton                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129038/#Comment_129038" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T08:31:34+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  8:31AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 22, 2008 8:32AM by J_Walton.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's the discussion Clinton &amp; I had yesterday about it:\n<blockquote><b>Clinton:</b> Was there anything in particular that tripped you up?

That makes sense. I may try a game of it without them and see how it goes.<br/>  For your use: "You play for tricks, describing what\u2019s happening in the scene, until one person has won the specified number of tricks. That person is the winner. There should be some wrap-up narration, and the person who played the highest card numerically in the last trick - not necessarily the winner - is responsible for that narration."<br/><b>me:</b> part of the problem was that Adam sometimes set stakes like "and your powers are revealed" but then we revealed our powers by playing trumps<br/>so you might want a note about that<br/>  your shouldn't set stakes that could happen through play already<br/><b>Clinton:</b> Right.<br/>  Actually...<br/>  You just totally cleared up an entire problem for me, maybe.<br/><b>me:</b> really? awesome!<br/><b>Clinton:</b> Stakes shouldn't be able to ever directly affect a character's person or identity until the last act.

It's definitely helped clarify the process I should be using in play.<br/><br/>Another question for your consideration is - what would be the best way to showcase this game in a short-form play (e.g. a 3-4 hour convention slot)?<br/><br/>The game, as I read it, would probably work best over three to four sessions of play.  But I'm wondering if there is any viable way to achieve end game in a single session of play without robbing the game of an emotional build up or making really disruptive breaks.<br/><br/>The thought I had was that in every act each player gets a single scene (if less than 4 players, multiple scenes might be permitted).  Each new scene has to incorporate or reference some material of any prior scene (I believe Ron calls this "weaving") to build cohesion.  Each scene after the first one in a Act has to be related to or involve one of the "Ending the Act" elements for the current Act.<br/><br/>With an average scene taking 10 - 15 minutes for free play and resolution, for four players this still likely exceeds the 4 hour time limit (15 min x 4 players x (1 prologue +  4 Acts) = 5 hours).<br/><br/>Is this an impossible or unhelpful goal for this game?  Does playing the Face of Angels in quick form do it a terrible disservice?  Or are there better suggestions on how to approach this?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130914/#Comment_130914" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-27T11:54:30+00:00" title="February 27, 2008 11:54AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel like trying to play the game in anything less than two-sessions would seem really rushed, but that's just me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130917/#Comment_130917" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-27T12:00:10+00:00" title="February 27, 2008 12:00PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've tried to run FoA in a four hour slot before.

I'm totally happy with a game that structures play for a defined length (e.g 3 or 4 sessions) if it really improves the overall experience.  I'd love to run it again and actually try to let the game itself set it's own pace for greatest effect.  Obviously it makes playtesting more challenging for Clinton, but there are plenty of games I can play in one session.  Changing the tempo is a good thing.<br/><br/>Clinton, the game feels pretty well-baked for me.  The two issues I see as needing more explanation are (1) how to choose good stakes to negotiate from (e.g. don't specify much detail of outcomes) and (2) a little more detail on Relationships, ownership, and examples of how best to include them in a scene or conflict (maybe along the lines how "The Shab-al_hiri Roach" spends some time discussing how NPCs or groups can be narrated into play).  None of this should be a surprise from my prior comments, but I just want to restate them here for clarity.<br/><br/>But let me state that I am gratified to hear that you have some more interest in "finishing" the game.  I've been excited since the first AP on it was posted with the Red and Black Prophets.  So I'll be first in line if this is released in any official form.  Good luck and let me know if I can help provide any further feedback or clarify my statements if they are unclear.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
