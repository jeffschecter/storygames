They seem to be doing OK, so I shrugged and took the padlock off the door.</p>\n<p><strong>SO!</strong> If you've got a game that you're working on that meets <a href="http://glyphpress.com/talk/forum/game-design-studio/how-to-critique" rel="nofollow">the minimum standards for community assessment</a>, bring it over to <a href="http://glyphpress.com/talk/forum/game-design-studio/" rel="nofollow">The Game Design Studio</a> and we'll help you make it better, with the caveat that you help other people make theirs better, too!</p>\n<p>We've got Misspent Youth's screen PDF up for crit, as well as Dungeonfuckers. This is going to be a rowdy session.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
