I don't know if our GM came up with this herself, but I'm gonna give her the credit because I've never seen it before.<br/><br/>S7S has some neat end-of-session mechanics that she wanted to show off (Ephemera, if anyone's interested).  In order to work the idea into a 4-hour con session, she called an intermission about halfway through the game.  She shepherded us through the first big setpiece and a little investigation, then she called a break.  She says, "Now the intermission music plays.  Let's go over the rules for Ephemera."  We went around the table, passed out our little bennies, and then took a break before jumping back into the plot.<br/><br/>Seems like a really clever way to bring in those cool between-session mechanics of story games that are hard to show off in a con game or one-shot.  Right off the bat, it seems like a good thing to do after a big DitV conflict or between the player turn and the next GM turn in Mouse Guard.<br/><br/>Does this sound like a good idea to you?  How would you implement it?  I admit my story game tastes aren't au courant.  Can some of you more hip people think of other games that might benefit from this approach?  Can you see using it in a home campaign?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jerome_Larre" title="Jerome_Larre"><img alt="Jerome_Larre" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://tengajdr.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/smallavatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jerome_Larre">Jerome_Larre</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349217/#Comment_349217" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-19T09:27:43+00:00" title="November 19, 2011  9:27AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, on one of the games I am currently working on, <b>Guts</b>, has two different mechanics about PC progress and I often use something similar to this "intermission" for showing them to convention players.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo give a very rough insight about the game, let's say you can imagine the <i>Inglourious Basterds </i>or <i>Howling Commandos</i>, just after they stole copies of the <i>Rocketeer</i>'s jetpack and<i> Black sheep squadron</i>'s corsairs, now helping <i>Sucker punch</i>'s bomber against the dragon mother. Add up some attitude and put the music louder. Basically we try to mix these high speed action dogfights with drama like it can be seen for exemple in Battlestar Galactica or original Robotech/Macross. To have more info, please feel free to check the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://lapinmarteau.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/GUTSBD-final.pdf" rel="nofollow">small comic</a> or these pics showing some of the material :<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.tartofrez.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/rouge_mini.jpg" rel="nofollow">1</a> <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.tartofrez.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/fdp_mini.jpg" rel="nofollow">2</a> <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.tartofrez.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/env_mini.jpg" rel="nofollow">3</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSo, bascially, there are two mechanics for progress :<br/>\n- The first one is centered about the planes (which are fully part of PCs). Points are given to their leader (one of them) who has the responsability to distribute them among the group. The leader can both give the points to anybody, or even pay with them for the real upgrades or repairs. Of course, he can keep all of them for himself. He decides and faces the consequences. The game includes some kind of competition (you need to show off, the leader position, ...) and of cooperation (if you don't act as a team, every single of its member might be in great trouble).<br/>\n- the second one is about piloting skill (the other skills are very common). You get checks on your piloting track and during a game session, whenever you feel it is the right time for it, you might say you learnt something and are using it. You don't learn between action but though it. Then you bet as much check as you want from your track and if you do less or same number with a D6, your skill increase by one point. Of course, whatever checks you bet are lost whether your stat increase or not. If you got guts and luck you rise quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese two mechanics are very unusual for regular conv players back here. The idea of somebody else than the DM to distribute "XP" or that skill increase might be not be some sort of stable routine (and that "XP" might be spent without any gain) might be unsettling. Thus we don't even take time to talk players about them in the presentation of the game, we just show them during the play and, almost everytime, things go smoothly. Players themselves often tell us they like it but they wouldn't even give the idea the chance if they havn't played it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we often use this "intermission" for convention demo, even though we don't name it that way. But we also use it because it gives the players a strong sense of achievement or give a cliffhanger far much more strength if you use it wisely. It is also some way to refocus the players about challenges to come (it is not as much about experience for what they did, than about building for what is they will face... some kind of "loading time").<br/>\n<br/>\nUsually, we use it once or twice during a game (depending of the length), usually to separate the different acts/tempos (typically for a 6 actual hours game, the first after 1h30, the last after 4h30, when the time as come to go for the final part).<br/>\n<br/>\nJerome.<br/>\nP.S : I guess my message might not be as clear as I would like it to be.

We can let time pass so complications from session 1 can build, update Hx, and re-highlight Stats. <br><br>This is very valuable in Mouse Guard. If you have a 4 hour con slot, it is much better to run 2 GM and 2 Player Turns than elongate things to fill time. You give new people a better idea of what it's like to play at home.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
