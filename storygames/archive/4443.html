I've been thinking about it a lot recently, and the post about Ryan's D&amp;D hacks really cemented things for me.  Here's the first draft of my D&amp;D hack "Say Yes or Face the Dungeon!"<br/><br/>This is a hack for D&amp;D which turns dungeons (or any other closed series of encounters) into a conflict resolution system. In this hack, the players say what their characters are doing, and the DM either agrees (says yes), or makes them "Face the Dungeon".  Facing the dungeon works just like conflict resolution in any other game.  The GM and the players set stakes together, then the characters (or only some of the characters) face the dungeon. I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll talk more about what \xe2\u20ac\u0153facing the dungeon\xe2\u20ac\x9d means below.  If the characters beat the dungeon, they win their stakes.  If they don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t, they lose the stakes.  There are two complications:  <br/><br/>First, in normal D&amp;D, you hardly ever lose.  Sure, you get beat up, sometimes a character dies, but a total failure to beat a dungeon is a pretty rare thing.  If you do fail, it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s also problematic, because usually this means that all the PCs are dead.  Boring.  So, how to change this? Ryan\xe2\u20ac\u2122s \xe2\u20ac\u0153Raising the Stakes\xe2\u20ac\x9d hack provides the answer.  The problem with \xe2\u20ac\u0153Raising the Stakes\xe2\u20ac\x9d is that, absent any other factor, running out of hit points doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t really have any negative consequences, or if it does, they are entirely at the hands of the DM.  In \xe2\u20ac\u0153Say Yes or Face the Dungeon!\xe2\u20ac\x9d the consequences of everyone running out of hit points are outlined during stakes setting.  For example, if the conflict was \xe2\u20ac\u0153Convince this hamlet to ally with the nearby Elves\xe2\u20ac\x9d, and the stakes were \xe2\u20ac\u0153they ally with the Elves or else they ally with the Orcs\xe2\u20ac\u0153, and the characters faced a dungeon in which they all ran out of hit points, even though the characters are still alive, the consequences of failure happen, the hamlet allies with the Orcs.  To really give this teeth, the DM should ramp up the difficulty of all encounters.  I\xe2\u20ac\u2122d suggest increasing the numbers of enemies faced, rather than the CR.  Four times as many enemies in general seems a good rule.  Opponents even one or two CRs higher than the party are a very big threat.<br/><br/>Second problem: What can the PCs achieve? You can\xe2\u20ac\u2122t declare a conflict \xe2\u20ac\u0153I take over the world\xe2\u20ac\x9d, and expect your first level character to succeed.  What\xe2\u20ac\u2122s needed is a simple chart that outlines the base CR for a given conflict, to give the DM a guideline.  Outlining twenty separate difficulty levels is a pain though.  Once again, Ryan comes to the rescue, with E6.  Six levels of challenge is much more manageable, and I think it fits better with the aims of this hack as well.  The idea that the most world-sweeping changes to the world are achievable by a sixth level character makes total sense.  Here\xe2\u20ac\u2122s the prototype chart, showing the level of the challenge and what can be achieved:<br/><br/>1: Influence a single person of moderate power (a town mayor, the priest of a small church), or a small group of insignificant power (an entire hamlet, part of a town).  <br/>2: Influence several people of moderate power (a noble family, a clique of courtiers, a council of elders), or a large group of weak power (a whole town, a minor city gang, a local militia).  Create a relationship with a single person of moderate power that allows for significant favours.  Gain titles, land, or wealth that grants minor status in a small region.<br/>3: Influence a single person of significant power (a baron or duke, a high-ranking member of a major religion, or a small group of moderate power (another adventuring party of equivalent level, a political faction, a gang of bandits).  Gain titles, land, or wealth that grants great status in a small region, or else some recognition that is globally renowned.<br/>4: Influence a single person of great power (a king or queen, the leader of a major religion), or large groups of moderate power (cities, clans, faiths). Gain titles, land, or wealth that grants great status in a large region.<br/>5: <br/>6: Create a lasting relationship with a person of great power. Gain control of vital resources for large areas.<br/>7: Influence a single person of immense power (a mighty wizard or dragon, celestials and demons), or a large group of great power (armies, minor races) Become a King or Queen.<br/>8:<br/>9:<br/>10: Influence a deity.  Sway nations, or entire races. <br/><br/> <br/>That\xe2\u20ac\u2122s super rough though.  I think this is a really tricky thing to get right, and I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m wondering if there\xe2\u20ac\u2122s a better way to do it.  Perhaps a simple extension of stake setting? So, if the DM feels the player is asking for too much, they can simply say \xe2\u20ac\u0153Ok, but it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s CR+1\xe2\u20ac\x9d or whatever.  Similarly, the players could argue for a reduced CR.  That might lead to boring play though.<br/><br/>The DM should have at hand three or four pre-prepared dungeons (or other string of encounters) which comprise three encounters of a CR equal to or near the level of the party.  The DM should feel free to mix up this formula a little, with several weak encounters, or one encounter of a slightly higher CR than the party.  Bear in mind that \xe2\u20ac\u0153appropriate CR\xe2\u20ac\x9d for this hack means about four times as many opponents as usual.  When the characters must \xe2\u20ac\u0153face the dungeon\xe2\u20ac\x9d, the DM should pull out one of these prepared dungeons (of appropriate CR), and give a little into to it, like \xe2\u20ac\u0153it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s a dungeon full of orcs\xe2\u20ac\x9d or \xe2\u20ac\u0153it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s fighting Gnolls in a forest\xe2\u20ac\x9d.  Then all the players should work out how this dungeon can be used to resolve the current conflict.  All players are free to improvise facts about the world to help this process.  \xe2\u20ac\u0153Maybe the village hates the Elves because they stole a holy symbol, but it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s really at the bottom of a dungeon full of Orcs!\xe2\u20ac\x9d \xe2\u20ac\u0153Maybe the Orc ambassador is holed up in a dungeon near here, and if we can kill them all they won\xe2\u20ac\u2122t have a chance to talk to the village!\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/><br/>Single Encounters:<br/>I think there should be a place or single encounters in this scheme.  Perhaps if a conflict feels like it doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t deserve a full dungeon, if the character wants something pretty minor, or most of all, if an NPC is provoking a conflict, perhaps a single encounter is called for.  This could cover things that the DM wants to have happen in play, but doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t want to cause by fiat.  For example \xe2\u20ac\u0153all your stuff gets stolen\xe2\u20ac\x9d, \xe2\u20ac\u0153the village is burned to the ground\xe2\u20ac\x9d or whatever.  I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m not sure if that\xe2\u20ac\u2122s a good idea though, or how often these should happen.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100362/#Comment_100362" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-01T23:00:45+00:00" title="October  1, 2007 11:00PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome!<br/><br/>I actually think D&amp;D works well up until about 12th or 13th level though;  I'm sure it works well for many groups, but I have little interest in E6.

It seems to assume that players will abuse the mechanic, thinking that they can ask for anything. Won't their requests be based on their character's motives and such? And can't the GM just say no, if the request seems ridiculous? Just like any contest where the player says, "I'm going to destroy the world by crossing heavy traffic?" <br/>\n<br/>\nI'd let the players have some idea of what the dungeons are, and have them "bid" them (in keeping with Raising the Stakes). "Uh, I'll take on the White Plume Mountain so my character can win the heart of his the maiden-princess of his dreams." I'd respond, "Yes, but she'll continue to play coy until you do the Tomb of Horrors, as well." <br/>\n<br/>\nYou know, negotiate, until everyone is happy with the stakes on both sides. Like you're indicating should be done with the failure stakes. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn this case, one also bids the single encounters for smaller things.

In practice though, I think you're right that it's not needed, and may actually cause more problems than it solves.  I wanted to avoid situations where the DM had to say no to the players without some concrete rule to point to, but I think that the way you suggest, with the GM pitching dungeons and the players bidding on them, is much cooler.  Do you think there needs to be a formal process for that?  It also kind of changes the focus from "Say Yes or Face the Dungeon" to "Find a Dungeon then come up with a reason".  I'm not sure which would be more satisfying in play.  What's your feeling?<br/><br/>John, "40 Goblin" encounters are a hassle, you're right.  Actually, the "x4" is a mistake.  It should be "x(the number of members in the party)", which might help or hinder the issue.  I think that by the time you're fighting forty goblins, which is (off the top of my head) about a CR 4, there are a lot of other tougher things you can throw at the party.  The hack removes the need to have opponents that fit the situation at all, so that if you find goblin encounters (or any other horde of low-level foes) there's no need to have them.  Also, D&amp;D provides a lot of options for levelling up NPCs to make them tougher.  The other way to increase the difficulty without increasing the CR of the monsters (which gets pretty unfair) is to increase the number of encounters without rest.  I was reluctant to do this because I didn't want a single dungeon to take up too much time, so that the conflict dominated play when some of the players weren't interested in it.<br/><br/>How do people feel about the "Single Encounter" issue? I kind of think it's a good idea to break up the flow of play, and also one dungeon and one single encounter makes for a good evening of play, with regards to time.  So what would you do with these?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100810/#Comment_100810" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-03T11:52:43+00:00" title="October  3, 2007 11:52AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite>Awesome!<br/><br/>I actually think D&amp;D works well up until about 12th or 13th level though;  I'm sure it works well for many groups, but I have little interest in E6.

As you stack on more feats, you can reliably face CRs up to 10.  And it kind of tops out there.  If you wanted it to cap at 12 or 13, you'd so something in the area of E8 or E10.  If you wanted to do E12, then the CR might cap as high as 16 or 18 or so (maybe a little less, the high level game might make it even more difficult).<br/><br/>Simon,<br/><br/>This is great!  It really cemented something in my head on story game design, about the cost of failure.  It also highlights that good use of dungeons almost does this already.  You go into to the ancient citadel to find the magical doo-hicky to help defeat the dragon that is coming for it's annual village attack.  The main difference, is when you fail you don't get to try Plan B, or go back in, but the village is attacked by the dragon. Now they have to redeem themselves, or maybe seek revenge, and that leads to the next dungeon!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100820/#Comment_100820" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-03T12:17:36+00:00" title="October  3, 2007 12:17PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 3, 2007 12:19PM by Mike_Holmes.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon, yeah, as examples of play or something, they might work well. Just to give people an idea of the process and what one group might negotiate like. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of the process, I think it's still goal first, dungeon selection second. And I think it needs to be formalized, yes, simply because I think everything is better when formal (so take that with a grain of salt). But as an example:<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer: "Hmmm. My character needs to get into the Duke's good graces. I'm calling for a dungeon [there's your formality]. How about he is near the caves of chaos from Keep on the Borderlands, and needs those cleared out?"<br/>\n<br/>\nDM: "Are you kidding me? Maybe if he was some lightweight local official, but the Duke? He's important. How about he needs you to get an idol from the Shrine of the Kua-Toa?"<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer: "Hmm. What's that one like?"<br/>\n<br/>\nDM: "It's this huge temple complex crawling with Kua-toans." <br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer: "Hmmm. If it's huge and crawling, that sounds way too tough. How about we know where the idol is in the temple?" <br/>\n<br/>\nDM: "OK, it's on the altar of Blibdoolpoolp in the central hall."<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer: "Guarded by their best, I suppose?"<br/>\n<br/>\nDM: "Maybe... I'm not telling, that's for you to discover as you go in, if you accept the mission."<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer: "Fine, let's lock in [formality the second part] the Shrine with the idol on the altar."<br/>\n<br/>\nDM: [Third part of the formalities] "Dungeon locked. What about negative stakes?" <br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer: "Hmm. How about if we just can't get the idol and are forced to run?"<br/>\n<br/>\nDM: "Nope, I think you should get caught, if you fail, and then get traded on down to these folks called the Drow."<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer: "How about we get caught, but get a chance to escape before being traded down?"<br/>\n<br/>\nDM: [Formality]OK, let's lock those stakes. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer: [Completing formalities] Yep, locked. <br/>\n<br/>\nDM: OK you can do the standard prep, and then we're off to the Shrine!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNote that I still think that it's cool as part of this process to ensure that there's an explanation of how success in the dungeon explains the gaining of the stakes. <br/>\n<br/>\nI still love the single encounter option as a bid:<br/>\nPlayer: "Hmm, I want my character to get a wand of magic missiles.

I'm going to have to go back and write this up as a step-by-step process, but I like it.  I'm concerned though, about how much pressure this puts on the GM to get things right.  D&amp;D has a very tight economy of character power.  Throwing in a magic item of great power at the wrong time could be disastrous, and I wonder if there shouldn't be a strict guideline for that (something like how Donjon has strict limits on how much loot you can find).  Actually, thinking about it, the DMG already provides that, I just need to look it up.  It has a CR to gp conversion chart.  If you want a wand of magic missiles, you just have to figure out the gp value, look up what level of challenge provides that amount of treasure, and "hey presto!"<br/><br/>Something else I'm thinking about is what to do with multiple PCs not always working together.  Why would I go help the wizard get himself a wand of magic missile?  Why would I go with the fighter to recover the D'arneth signet ring to win the right to marry the prince? Obviously, the players can come up with motivations, but always having to do so seems a bit frustrating.  Sitting out of the fight would be annoying too, though.  Can one dungeon be made to do double service?

Whether it be a golden statue or a level boss or getting the goblins to fight the zombies, there's often multiple things going on in the best classic dungeons and the players play to that.<br/><br/>My point is:  How does this method handle these more complex dungeons?

I think that maybe it's possible to do something with dungeons which resolve multiple conflicts, so the DM can build in multiple "areas" or multiple objectives within the scenario.  I think that expoliting that would make the game a heck of a lot more interesting.  I love the idea of going down into a dungeon to make sure the orcs stay in their homes, but <i>also</i> because one character wants to find his father's sword, or whatever.  It's complex though.  The DM needs to be able to prep dungeons ahead of time, and can't always rely on there being a call for a multiple-conflict dungeon.  Dungeons have a limited shelf-life too, if they're not used for a while, they become too low-level for the party.<br/><br/>I really need to hash out a formal negotiation process for how dungeons are selected, and what conflicts they can resolve.  <br/><br/>Matt, I'm kinda loath to change the experience system, just because I kinda like how it works out pretty well with characters getting rewarded for resolving conflicts, no matter the nature of the conflict.  It's someting worth thinking about though, and like how your hack explicitly rewards helping other party members.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad" title="Caesar Slaad"><img alt="Caesar Slaad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad">Caesar Slaad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101526/#Comment_101526" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-07T11:00:05+00:00" title="October  7, 2007 11:00AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your chart and idea are cool, but FWIW I'm with Deliverator here in that E6 stops short of what I consider to be "the good stuff" in D&amp;D.

I'd soooo love to play D&amp;D this way. What I'm wondering about is something that Simon touched on in his last post: prep time. It's certainly NOT easy to whip out a Dungeon quickly in D&amp;D (at least not beyond a 3-5 room low-level "starter dungeon"). But for this play idea to fly, you'd have to either generate them on the spot or have a variety prepared to choose from--which as Simon said would "go stale" as PCs outgrew their power level.<br/><br/>One thing you could do is have a sample of <i>layouts</i> on hand, then people them with the appropriate denizens and traps/puzzles for the dungeon challenge the players pick (actually, with Dungeon tiles, of which I have a buttload, generating just the layouts on the fly <i>would</i> be easy). If you've got the major players of the gameworld locality statted out and ready, maybe it wouldn't be too hard to throw together of an evening, as opposed to generating the Lizard-folk necro-cult of the Hunter's Moon or whatever out of thin air.<br/><br/>Another way to approach this might be to time the  wagering for the end of session, so that players could Face the Dungeon! the next week. But it might be tricky to pace things that way, and actually a detriment to story flow.

What sparked this idea was actually a thread at the forge where a guy was wondering what to do about all the wasted prep he was doing, while not having anything prepared for what the PCs actually ended up doing.  It got me thinking about how to make a D&amp;D game that guaranteed no wasted prep.  The idea has moved away from that a little, but that's what's at its core.<br/><br/>See, I <i>like</i> prepping dungeons.  I like rummaging through charts and rolling up treasure and thinking up devious tactical twists to make a boring fight into an interesting challenge.  I imagine I'm not alone.  What I hate though is never getting to use all that work.  I hate it when I have to bin a dungeon because it's not where the PCs wanted to go, and I hate even worse the temptation to shuffle things around so that they end up going ther anyway.  So I tried to have it both ways.<br/><br/>I think the way it works now there's still going to be some wasted prep, but I'm working on ways to do away with that.  What you suggest, tools to make up dungeons on the fly, would certainly work.  But it's not going to get me my dungeon making fix, and I think sometimes it can lead to kinda stale dungeons.  Certainly I think it could be part of the toolkit of a DM, so that you can be extra prepared, but I always want to be able to spend a half-hour drawing up a really nasty dungeon for the characters to face off against.<br/><br/>What I'm coming to is the idea that there should be two kinds of encounter.  Small scale, single encounters, which can be made up on the fly, or prepped really easily, and then great big set-piece dungeons.  The small scale encounters can be used to resolve conflicts as they come up.  A PC wants to find a magic item, wants to attract romantic attention, wants to befriend a local mayor, or whatever.  The big dungeons can be used more formally.  The players know that they're going to be facing one big dungeon, so they should come up with a major task that they want to achieve from it.  They're welcome to come up with multiple tasks, but that's going to reduce the amount they can achieve with the dungeon overall.  In both cases, it works just like bidding.  <br/><br/>GM "Today we have the Caves of Calamity, a level six dungeon, with lots of encounters"<br/>Player One: "Ok cool! We've been bothered by those orcs for too long.  Let's stop them once and for all!"<br/>Player Two: "That's cool, but I really want to recover my father's sword."<br/>GM: "Well, the dungeon's not <i>that</i> tough, I don't think you can do both."<br/>Player One: "Dude, the orcs are far more pressing than some stupid sword.

So, you go into a dungeon to convince the hamlet to side with the elves instead of the orcs.  That's the meta reason.  The in-game reason is because they're proving themselves heroes and getting treasure.</blockquote>\nActually, I think part of the awesome of this idea is the premise of tailoring dungeons to the player goal in a NON-meta way, i.e. the Dungeon provides proof of the Orcs' treachery or the hamlet's long-lost Elven heritage, or whatever. That way you get your dungeon-crawlin' badassery, but it all hangs together froma storytelling perspective, too.<br/><br/>Ah, okay.  Huh, I didn't even consider that for some reason. And it's easy to do either way. And even a mix of both, or change it dungeon to dungeon. It's very flexible.<br/><br/>And I think Simon's latched onto to something that was in my previous post, but is coalescing much better now.<br/><br/>You could have the group goal and individual goals, so that one person doesn't have to be stuck with the goal to move the plot forward.  So there's evidence against the Orcs, AND a magic sword from the Fighter's cultural heritage, AND a rare statue of the cleric's god, AND so on.  And you get a more complex dungeon.  And if you make sure the personal goals aren't just treasure, but treasure connected to the character in question, it serves as a way to get cool items and drive personal stories success or failure.  So there's a risk which each of the personal elements, like maybe whether the Church in the Hamlet falters or gets renewed faith, or whether the fighter proves his family's nobility or becomes an outcast, etc.<br/><br/>Instead of making it strictly tougher, it does so by making it more complex.  And maybe this can be changed in the dungeon.  Inside they realize it's really tough.  So the Fighter's player goes, "We are getting our butts handed to us, lets focus on stopping the Orcs.  I'll have to get the piece of my father's sword another time."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102328/#Comment_102328" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-10T15:35:35+00:00" title="October 10, 2007  3:35PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alvin Frewer</cite>I'll have to get the piece of my father's sword another time."</blockquote>\nWhich leads to my favorite type of dungeoncrawl: "Return to ......"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102352/#Comment_102352" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-10T19:17:03+00:00" title="October 10, 2007  7:17PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What if the dungeon had various areas or challenges that corresponded to each character's goal?<br/><br/>For instance, "finding the Golden Fetish" = "getting a piece of your father's sword", "making it through the Iron Waterfall" means the Church regains its trust, etc.--maybe "killing all the monsters" is a challenge, and so on.<br/><br/>You can let the players all brainstorm to figure out how those things connect in the game world--maybe the Golden Fetish actually conceals a piece of the sword, or can be exchanged for the piece of the sword because the guy who has the sword really wants this Fetish, and maybe the Iron Waterfall contains the skull of St. Cuthbert, which the Church lost years ago...<br/><br/>Once the characters are in the dungeon, it could lead to some interesting conversations:<br/><br/>"Ooh! See those wall markings! I bet they lead to the Iron Waterfall. I say we go right!" <br/><br/>If they find themselves in too deep, they may need to figure out which goal they're going to pursue, and which they will abandon.

It worked great!<br/><br/>We come upon a barred door. Classic D&amp;D thing, and in classic style, we start coming up with crazy ass ways to open it. We especially want to open it sneakily and surprise anyone on the other side.<br/><br/>Tony has the hobgoblins on the other side call out, "Fargle? Is that you, you worthless lizard?" And we're like, "Uh... yessss, masters! It's Fargle!"<br/><br/>And they're like, "Well, if you don't have that map from the spider cavern, you might as well go away. We're not letting you in without it."<br/><br/>So then we have a choice: force the door and fight the hobgoblins straight up, or go find the map and then get in with sneakiness and surprise. Basically, since there was no mechanic for "trick the guards" Tony let us face the dungeon instead. "Explore the spider cavern successfully" == "Trick the hobgoblin guards." This worked wonderfully, and also made the dungeon culture come alive a bit, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_116357">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116357/#Comment_116357" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-26T15:23:07+00:00" title="December 26, 2007  3:23PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I was totally inspired by this thread. I posted <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=5115&amp;page=1#Item_8" rel="nofollow">an AP for the game</a>, but I totally left this part out. The Red Box works so awesome as long as the players stick to the limited set of options. Once they break out of them, the game starts to break down. So as a patch, I decided that the players could do non-standard options only by fulfilling a short dungeon quest of some sort.<br/><br/>I'm also totally in favor of low-to-no-prep dungeoning. Like Colin, I love the prep but I loath the waste. I'm trying for a method that cuts out the parts of prep I don't like, but still lets me have fun getting ready. Moldvay works beautifuly for this. There's a simple table to roll to discover what combination of monster/treasure/trap the room contains. One of the options you can roll is "special". What the hell does that mean? It means you make it up. So I came in with a handful of "specail" rooms in reserve and pulled them out when I needed them.<br/><br/>Moldvay also fudges beautifully on when to use the table and when not. He essentially tells you to map out the main monster and boss of the dungeon and fill in the gaps with the table. So off to one side I've got a few monster groups. They're not even statted, just a sentence each like "an outpost of the Gnoll kingdom under a ruthless leader" or "kobolds are bribing the owlbear with giant fungus titbits, but now they're running out". Each of those is good for 3-4 linked rooms. You can end up with a dungeon that's quick and organic, but still has things to prepped for the players to discover. That's my goal, anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_116379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116379/#Comment_116379" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-26T18:27:54+00:00" title="December 26, 2007  6:27PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool!
