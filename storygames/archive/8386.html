Narration will proceed and get to a point which is unsatisfactory and then players (as players) will discuss the situation and then frequently jump back to the point in the narrative where the problem arose and explore (in character) a better alternative. It's never very far back but it seems to echo the way thoughts in your head form, complete, and are re-edited before being spoken. The end result is that the text of the game, the linear "story" of our actual play is not actually the narrative we told -- our real narrative zig-zagged forwards and backwards. An example (heavily elided):<br/><br/>Brad: Okay the police capture your ship and take you to Lostengo.<br/>All: Hrm okay.<br/>Tim: How far away exactly are we from this ship?<br/>Brad: Does it matter?<br/>Tim: Can I jump there?<br/>JB: Like personally? Out the big hole?<br/>Tim: Yeah.<br/>Brad: What is it that you want to do?<br/>Tim: Board their ship and shoot them in the head.<br/>All: Laughter<br/>Brad (after a pause): Fuck yeah. (retcon implicitly to before the jump, and start a boarding scene)<br/><br/>Mini retcon complete. I didn't even realize that we do it until I listened to us doing it on the audio. Do you do it? More to the point, I guess, is what do you think you do? And do you have a record to listen to to see if you're right?<br/><br/>This is probably not actually an interesting discovery, but it's thrilling me that the story is so malleable, yet we recall it with such solidity.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185266/#Comment_185266" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-30T02:19:23+00:00" title="December 30, 2008  2:19AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I've noticed this.

I'd sometimes have one Player try to trap a second player with one of those "gotcha" moments ("But you said you were opening the door...!") -- even if the first Player wasn't involved in a scene.  And I'd be like... "Hey, this isn't an SAT test.  Let's just let him listen first and it'll be cool.<br/><br/>And then I realized I'd also shift things around if I realized the person would have chosen the cooler story beat choice if he'd thought of it a second before, and then I'd ask, "Hey, would your rather have have done so-and-so???" And the person would nod their head with excitement and I'd go, "Okay, you did that."<br/><br/>Then I noticed the same sort of play halfjack described at my own group's games.  That's when I came up with the analogy of our Sorcerer sessions being more like a writer's room for a TV show, breaking a script for an upcoming episode. We'd always be moving forward in the long run, but making tiny adjustments to go backward a beat or two to add better ideas, nail down color or detail or clarity to punch up the moment, or make a slight turn in the story trajectory (through character choice) to launch the narrative in a more interesting direction.<br/><br/>In some cases we'll readjust something from a few minutes ago -- things that would make perfect sense, make everyone happier, and strengthen the narrative choices of the characters.<br/><br/>It's been really freeing to realize <i>I just do it</i> and to no longer wonder if I was breaking some sort of RPG totem.  My guess is that MOST games sessions involve this, but most folks don't see it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185274/#Comment_185274" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-30T04:48:00+00:00" title="December 30, 2008  4:48AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We do this too.

At least it lines up with Daniel Dennett's theory of consciousness.

Creativity is very often non-linear, and the finished product is almost always the end result of many layers of going back and forth and adding new stuff to what's already been hashed out.  So on the one hand, I'm pretty sure I don't really dig on this sort of thing because it makes roleplaying into a thing that's closer to what I'd consider work.  Work I enjoy, but work nonetheless.<br/><br/>I much prefer games where play is full steam ahead, always moving forward.  I often look to a game's mechanics to support this at the table.  Hence, when this doesn't happen, I often consider it a failure of the rules.  If you have to go back and change something, the rules didn't make it cool enough the first time and didn't keep you looking forward to what's about to happen next.  Now, all of that is totally my personal preferences, obviously, but I thought I'd throw that in there as a little counterpoint.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185346/#Comment_185346" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-30T15:33:29+00:00" title="December 30, 2008  3:33PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Josh, that's totally legit!

I don't actually know of any games that have rules for this kind of thing and I'm not sure how they would be enforceable if they were.  How do you discrimnate between "too late, you left the inn" and "no... I said the WAITRESS grabs the rope, you're thinking of the innkeeper's wife" or "so what... because I go for a piss my character suddenly turns into a paralysed deaf mute?".<br/><br/>As a GM I do this quite a bit largely because I have one player who is very prone to it (though to be fair his "before that..." interjections tend to have little or no bearing on play.  The only time I don't allow it is when it actually messes with something that is important in play.  So if people are always wanting to backtrack and buy rope I only allow it if I'm not too bothered about what the PCs have on them at any given time.  Similarly, if someone wants to backtrack because the group made the wrong decision then it questions why the group even makes decisions to start with... I might as well just have every decision tree lead to awesome.  It's a bit like cheating while rolling dice... if you're going to do that then why bother rolling in the first place?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185355/#Comment_185355" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-30T15:56:54+00:00" title="December 30, 2008  3:56PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It does seem like once you acknowledge the ability to 'go back' if it wasn't 'cool enough' you step onto a fairly slippery slope, where perfectionism can very easily slow things down to a crawl.

The excitement is the <i>operative</i> sensibility.  <br/><br/><br/>One other thing I do that might be considered along the perfectionism axis would be this:<br/><br/>Player A says something... A response to a choice, or a bit of description they're adding.  I listen, but I'm not quite sure what exactly the person meant.  Or, more importantly, I know there's more to what the person meant to be adding.  They haven't expressed to the table that little bit of whatever that prompted them to start talking in the first place.  So I'll ask, "Could you unpack that a little?"<br/><br/>And the person pauses, and then adds a whole bunch of detail that makes everyone nod as they get what the person was really after.<br/><br/>I was a little shy about doing this at first, but I've always seen it offer up more cool stuff that makes everyone at the table get a better sense of what the Player meant.  But it still doesn't strike me as perfectionism.  For me, at least, it's just a chance for people to have a moment to think through what it was they wanted to say and say it more clearly and precisely.  <br/><br/>For me, most of the games are <i>about</i> the color details and the fiction, so anything that deepens the color and fiction is a good thing.<br/><br/>Nobody has fled my table yet, so every once in a while I do it.  The Players seem to appreciate the chance to take a moment and figure out how to communicate more clearly what they were after.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EarthenForge" title="EarthenForge"><img alt="EarthenForge" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EarthenForge">EarthenForge</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185380/#Comment_185380" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-30T17:51:37+00:00" title="December 30, 2008  5:51PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Christopher - I really like your approach. I think I'll use that line more often. It validates everyone's contributions and allows that person to look cool. I also like using the "Yes, and" improv technique when someone else is stumped - you can still use their contribution, but add neat things to it. I've been a part of a few tables where one or more players are over-eager to do what's cool, and I find that annoying, because: <br/>1.) It often invalidates someone's contribution.<br/>2.) Sometimes it just feels like unrealistic expectations. Good novels and films are the result of countless hours of work, reediting, etc. A story game doesn't have that benefit, but that's not a bad thing! So the story may not go in the most maximally cool direction - so what? What it lacks in "coolness", it can gain in freshness and intensity - a thrill to be a part of!<br/>3.) "Cool" is such a subjective word. Often what makes one idea cooler than another in a game situation is not the idea itself but the interesting complications it brings or the detail it adds. So "he's really my father" can be just as cool to the story as "he's the manager of my Starbucks" - it all depends on how you spin it. There are billions of possibilities that will make an interesting story - if you take a moment to bolster a flimsy or skeletal idea, you're good to go. If you worry about doing what's cool all of the time, you slow the game down and cause unnecessary stress.<br/><br/>I've been thinking about approaches lately that allow the scene to slow down just enough to make it really rich - I think asking more questions (like "can you unpack that a little?") is a great solution, and you can ask it of anyone - GM or players.<br/><br/>-Rachel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185386/#Comment_185386" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-30T18:21:35+00:00" title="December 30, 2008  6:21PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: EarthenForge</cite>that allow the scene to slow down</blockquote>\nThis is kind of the focus of some of it.  I've noticed the folks who are playing in the scene feel really on the spot.  Which they are!  A performance anxiety is often evoked!<br/><br/>And because I play with people who are really into the story details and who set a high bar, there's a desire to do it "right" or whatever.  And, as you point out, Rachel, that's really tough to do on the spot.  <br/><br/>Often I'll cut away to another Player when I see that someone's brain is going into overdrive about what to say or how to respond.  (We once had a huge Bang in a Sorcerer game where the Player said, "Um, I honestly don't know what my guy is going to do."  The Player was kind of reeling.  I said, "How about we wait until next week?"  He said, "Yes!")<br/><br/>But sometimes it isn't time to cut away.  You know the scene should continue, but the Player is still working it.  And that's when I "slow it down."  I lean back.  I might say something like, "Take your time."  The other players are always very patient, but eager... we all know it'll be worth the wait.<br/><br/>I guess I'm emphasizing this because it's really quite different from how I used to GM, which was very fast paced, a lot of razzle dazzle, a lot of keeping the players on their toes, throwing things at them, having them make snap decisions.  These days it's not so much me putting on a show (or the players being entertained), than everyone having a hand in adding to the mix.  The act of creating is really the fun, so giving time and space for that is part of the fun as well.  When the Players are give time and space to dig a bit deeper into the details, there's more of that fun.  The change in my GM style is really quite pronounced.<br/><br/>Tying this all back to the thread, when someone has that moment or two to really find what matters to them about the character or the narrative beat, I find that the other Players often feel kibitzing in new suggestions: Player A says something, and then Player B says, "Oh, like that scene when you first saw that mirror!" and then Player A goes, "Right!!! So, it has a silver glow!" or whatever.  I'm really into call-backs (I think we call it recursive around here), but its hard to keep all those patterns we're making at the forefront of our brains.  So having everyone help people each other with jiggering little details not only deepens the fiction elements, but makes it more of a social, cooperative and shared creative act.<br/><br/>And, to be clear, sometimes Player B will say something, and Player A will go, "No, no, not that...."  But by contrast against Player B's suggestion, Player A usually finds what he was looking for pretty quickly.  It's like a negative space suggestion.<br/><br/>Years ago I would have been pretty down on folks "stepping on" other Players moments/words/talking/spotlight with suggestions.  But I'm finding more and more that if everyone at the table is on the same page in terms of wanting to share the responsibility of creative fiction together, the suggestions and kibitzing work really well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185390/#Comment_185390" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-30T19:20:11+00:00" title="December 30, 2008  7:20PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 30, 2008 7:23PM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, to be clear I think it's generally a slippery slope worth stepping onto. After all, the risk of slipping can be managed and the benefits are pretty significant. I just, personally, struggle with a kind of excessive authorship that is enabled when this sort of play becomes more common.<br/><br/>I like Jonathan's metaphor of 'bubbles', and I think this pretty accurately maps the organic way in which most groups manage this sort of tracking-back. The term 'retcon', to me, applies when you are going back a significant ways into the established <i>past</i> of play, and changing something -- it does not apply to what most people seem to be discussing in this thread, which has more to do with an understanding that in RPGs there is a kind of expanded present-tense, in which an entire exchange or even entire scene can be considered as the 'now' that everyone is influencing/describing/dealing with. Individual actions in these bubbles act as a kind of conditional past, but they don't really go on the record until the scene or exchange ends, and the bubble pops -- and during that time there is much greater room for negotiation.<br/><br/>It's also worth pointing out that this is kind of (or exactly) how <i>Polaris</i> works. Narration explicitly enters into a kind of conditional state, and it can either be directly affirmed or rejected OR it can be affirmed organically, by people simply continuing on from there. The more statements that have been built on top of a conditional event, the closer it is to being inviolably true.<br/><br/>Edited to add: Now I wonder if anyone has ever used an 'But only if' statement to explicitly alter a preceding event, instead of adding a proceding one. It happens implicitly all the time, but in my limited experience it is more by expanding the scope of previous action, or adding chronologically preceding events, but not by actually directly modifying a part of a previous statement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185396/#Comment_185396" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-30T20:17:36+00:00" title="December 30, 2008  8:17PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool thread.

No record, but I have a sense that we're sort of constantly clarifying and adjusting the narrative in real time. For example (pulled from a Hunter:the Vigil game I'm running):<br/><br/>"A" and "B" are poking around the apartment of their dead friend. B, a character with eidetic memory and a high academics roll, identifies an inscription on an object as being in Linear B. A has a friend and contact who is Greek.<br/><br/>Me: (after the academics roll) So, B, the inscription on the widget you found in the safe is in Linear B, which is very ancient Greek.<br/>A: OK, I snap a pic on my cell phone and send it to my Greek friend to see if he can translate it for me.<br/>Me: Wait -- are you sure? Linear B doesn't use the same alphabet as modern Greek...it's really only studied academically by a small subset of people.<br/>A: Oh, then, nevermind. I guess we'll have to hunt around the University...<br/><br/>The tricky part is: what really "happens" in terms of narrative?<br/><br/>- There's no explicit statement that B told A that it was ancient Greek, so A might not have ever even had a chance to bing up the subject of running it by his friend.<br/>- If B did tell A, did A offer to phone his friend, only to be told by B that A's friend probably wouldn't know anything about this?<br/>- Who makes the suggestion that the characters look for a Linear B scholar at the university? A's player brought it up, but was it in character or out-of-character?<br/>- Should I have even interjected with my observation?<br/><br/>I think this is why I've never actually finished an actual play write-up for my currently running Hunter game, despite intending to do so. Without a record, relying on my memory, it feels more like I'm writing a story than recreating the experience of play at the table...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185433">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185433/#Comment_185433" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-31T05:39:49+00:00" title="December 31, 2008  5:39AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Linear B example is really context dependent.

That's something I struggle with as a GM -- finding the conflicts that really have meat on them and are interesting, and putting the proper emphasis on them, instead of creating obstacles for the sense of creating obstacles.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EarthenForge" title="EarthenForge"><img alt="EarthenForge" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EarthenForge">EarthenForge</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185519/#Comment_185519" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-31T14:09:52+00:00" title="December 31, 2008  2:09PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I'm still waiting for the Roshomon-style RPG.

There is a transition between the two at some point, and objects in the 'present bubble' are easy to change, to the point that most groups probably regularly make such changes without thinking of them in the same way they would think of a change to a much further-removed in-game event (a true retcon.)<br/><br/>But both these past events and these present events and these pseudo-present events are all covered by your venn diagram analogy -- it's simply true of all events in the fictional narrative, period, and I don't know if it is any more or less true for more or less 'recent' events.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_187438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187438/#Comment_187438" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-10T16:05:38+00:00" title="January 10, 2009  4:05PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've gone so far as to mechanically account for this process in the system I'm currently working on.<br/><br/>This behavior is really not about managing when fictional events occur in the game, but about players being able to keep their expectations in sync.

People remember being immersed in a linear story but I'm not convinced it's actually how play flows unless the system's not being mechanically engaged at all except for relatively short sequences of dialogue.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the closest we get to linear play is when we are deep in the machine of a subsystem (combat, social combat, space combat) and following a strict procedure to order play, and we (literal "we" -- my table -- and not the general "we" that might have you and yours in it) generally report a BETTER feeling of immersion under these circumstance.<br/><br/>I guess where I'm headed with that is that immersion doesn't seem to be all that fragile. Maybe when we remember being engaged, we remember it as being immersed. Maybe we are rarely genuinely immersed (like a Method actor might be) in the moment, but we only really care about how we recall the story. The moment hardly exists at all.<br/><br/>That we might have you in it.

You could probably use a Cluedo-type system whereby the facts of the matter would be determined beforehand and the players would have to spin out yarns painting themselves in the best light given certain constraints and the others could then try and pick holes in their story forcing the player to reveal that he did not have a particular fact card and he was just guessing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_187572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187572/#Comment_187572" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-11T10:14:02+00:00" title="January 11, 2009 10:14AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan M</cite><br/>Then the second player jumpsin and says "NO!

In the next phase your read the story from the player on your right and re-write it the way YOU saw it. And it does produce a kind of miniature Roshomon effect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
