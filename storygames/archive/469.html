                            Of course not.  Design the game you want to play!  Random is awesome.  Drowning and Falling is exclusively random and is, hands down, the best roleplaying game ever written ever.  In fact, it will make other random generation games look pretty sad in comparison, so don't bother.                        </div>

                            Thems, mighty big claims... The best game ever written was the Yellow Dragon Inn, and it had random character generation also. (Edit: And it was played on an old dial up BBS that we connected to with our C64s!) I just found a copy (dot matrix baby) happily tucked away between the pages of the Floating Vagabond... And I thought I had lost everything in the great hard drive throwaway.<br/>
<br/>
My beef with random attributes was that you could end up with a character who was incompetent in all regards.  I did like the solution to random stats that were in the old Space Gamer games like Battle Born.  You rolled to see which stats your character was going to have, and in every roll, you'd have a character that would be good at something.<br/>
<br/>
So, I'd say a random chargen system would be good as long as it randomly creates good characters.                        </div>

                            Random is also good if you want the outcome to be inherently funny, which was my motivation in D&amp;F.                        </div>

                            Random character generation is good for some purposes, just as planned character generation is good for others.  What you point out -- the challenge of finding character and working to feel comfortable in alien shoes -- are both very well addressed by randomness.  I know I tried to acheive that sort of play in planned cgen games by picking the hardest options to reconcile, setting myself the challenge.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to seeing it, Ross.  Care to share how your random cgen works?                        </div>
