I was thinking about using some of the <a href="http://www.overstock.com/search?keywords=Dungeon%20Tiles&amp;taxonomy=&amp;SearchType=HP_Header" rel="nofollow">Dungeon Tiles</a> from wizards.  They're really quite beautiful, IMO.  The thing is, I've never used them before.  For those of you who have, how did you use them during play?  Were they helpful?  When did they get in the way, and when did they really help?  Also, do you have any advice on how to set them up?<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WillH" title="WillH"><img alt="WillH" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v488/Telpierion/minitardisicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WillH">WillH</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118255/#Comment_118255" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-07T07:42:11+00:00" title="January  7, 2008  7:42AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Personally, I prefer the good old battle mat.  here is just something charming about roughly sketching a map over an old faded map that you can't get off the mat because you left it there too long or used the wrong type of pen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118268/#Comment_118268" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-07T08:53:24+00:00" title="January  7, 2008  8:53AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like using the Dungeon Tiles, and similar products, for large scale set-pieces that I know or suspect will happen.  I've used several tiles laid out on a poster board to make city blocks, a city guard headquarters, and a trade post.  The trade post hasn't been used yet.  To this point, I've used these maps only for D&amp;D where the focus of the scene is on tactical combat or chases.  It almost never fails, though, that the fight or chase runs off the prepared map and we resort to sketching the scene out on paper.  I think they were helpful because they were visually attractive; they appeal to players who like maneuvering miniatures and finding advantages in the terrain; and I like being surprised at how the players interpret and use what's on the maps--like drawing water from a well to form a bucket brigade to fight a fire elemental.    <br/>As far as setting them up, I make them big.  I use blue masking tape to secure the tiles together.  The masking tape has pretty good hold but also can be removed without too much damage to the tiles.  The one drawback to the Dungeon Tiles specifically is that there are not enough tiles in a single package to make the size of mat I like.  The 'Fantastic Locations' module series has nice big maps that can be useful if the terrain is right.     <br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118269/#Comment_118269" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-07T08:58:17+00:00" title="January  7, 2008  8:58AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 7, 2008 8:58AM by Valvorik.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I use them in conjunction with battlemat and other options.<br/><br/>Context <br/><br/>Running D&amp;D 85%+ as designed gamist etc., so tactical maps needed, have the theory that good encounters are "like amusement rides" with lots going on, twists and turns, terrain features should be part of that and sometimes be unstable.<br/><br/>Use a battlemat to establish and underlying grid over whole table, often use (a) 3D plaster molded walls to set up rooms; or (b) predrawn room on a large sheet of graph paper when I want to 'smack room down and say "go!"'.<br/><br/>However, use the tiles to inspire me a bit beforehand.  Looking at them to think, if outdoors, "yeah, some bushes there, a ravine there, a rock outcropping there" as part of livening up terrain.  If indoors, I use them to quickly set up a room outline and with some of the funky options (energy walls etc.) again be a bit inspired.  I tend to then "set aside the selection for that room", often with the monster minis to be used in it, so that when it comes into play I bring it all out and can smack it down.<br/><br/>I also find that having the room laid out, not just mapped, makes me think more usefully about monster tactics, sizing and reach issues etc. and realize when as mapped room is going to be too lame etc.<br/><br/>Another trick I've used for them is where features are moveable, unstable etc., the tiles come into play nicely since you can actually move them around as would a moveable feature.  Combine them with graph paper or use them on top of each other.  E.G., in recent fight the tiles represent floor and a raised area in centre of room.  As a certain point the room shifts, the floor vanishes in some parts and the raised area slides back to block the exit.  By actually sliding the tiles across the floor (to reveal under some the predrawn pits and show the path of raised area threatening to crush anything in its way), the table became a little bit "animated" ~ one PC finds himself "standing on air" and another must make Reflex save as block of stone moves across floor at him.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bankuei" title="bankuei"><img alt="bankuei" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bankuei">bankuei</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118288/#Comment_118288" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-07T10:01:47+00:00" title="January  7, 2008 10:01AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 7, 2008 10:02AM by bankuei.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's my rundown of several different products:<br/><br/>D&amp;D Dungeon Tiles-<br/><br/>They're pretty solid board, which feels nice, and they're pretty easy to see and visually parse what's going on.  On the other hand, the rooms and passages are comparatively small, which means you might need to get a bunch to make bigger rooms, passages, etc.  Edit- oh yeah, I guess they started making bigger rooms at this point as well, but even then it feels a bit small compared to the options you get on a battle mat.<br/><br/>Gamemastery Tiles-<br/><br/>These are cardstock, though clearly printed.  They're cheap, and they come in many different sets with stuff ranging from "underground" to village.  I think they're super versatile, at least in what they offer.  They all fall in the same size, and sets will often have 4-6 that are designed to link together to form a larger room.   For about $20-30 you can get 2-3 sets that will serve most purposes.   Since they are a set size, though, you lack somewhat for specific room sizes, etc.<br/><br/>Rackham Tiles-<br/><br/>These are very colorful and pretty, but sometimes hard to visually parse.  They're huge though, and you get a solid set.  They include indoor, outdoor, towns, beaches, and docks, for a good variety, though they're pricey (I think $25 each?).  Their dungeon tiles, beach and docks are good.  The towns seem very cramped, and I'm not sure if they're operating on a different scale than 5x5 foot.  They give a tile with a lot of stuff like furniture, etc. you cut up and place on other tiles.<br/><br/>Descent- the Boardgame<br/><br/>Descent being a dungeon crawling boardgame, has a bunch of tiles for use.  It's a $50 investment, but you get some neat plastic minis, a bunch of doors, and the tiles are on solid board.  They're not spectacular in appearance, but there's enough to make solid dungeons with, and having the doors really helps a lot too.  <br/><br/>If you want maximum dungeon flexibility, I'd go with this.  Otherwise, I'd recommend a mix of the Gamemastery tiles and D&amp;D dungeon tiles.   The Rackham ones are pretty, but it's pretty hard to find yourself reusing them, unless you plan on having multiple fights in the same areas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118293/#Comment_118293" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-07T10:36:34+00:00" title="January  7, 2008 10:36AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now that we've drifted a bit away from just the Dungeon Tiles product line, might I suggest looking at <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.twilightcreationsinc.com/" rel="nofollow">Twilight Creations'</a></span> stuff (MidEvil in particular, Zombies!, When Darkness Comes). Most of the stuff is (modern) city and roads and stores; but later Zombies and WDC packs start to incorporate underground and woods, and all of MidEvil is set "in the past" (graveyard, castles). As you don't intend to play the games themselves as-written, you could cherry-pick the expansions that are most useful to your game setting(s). Plus, with most of them, you get some handy plastic miniatures (zombies, skeletons, dogs, etc).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118295">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118295/#Comment_118295" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-07T10:50:48+00:00" title="January  7, 2008 10:50AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Our group does not use mapping tiles and aids extensively, but when we do, we often combine peices from a bunch of different sources.

I find them a good combination of pretty and durable, and fun just to have, and throw out on the floor and play with like Legos. In actual game use, I've found them useful both for preplanning an area and for throwing one down on the spur of the moment. The latter might require a bit of patience from players as you fumble around for just. . .that. . .right. . .piece for the altar, but I try to keep them organized enough (in a tackle box with compartments for all the different sizes, 'cept the big, big ones) that this is minimized.<br/><br/>They're great when I bring them to someone else's D&amp;D game, so I can throw them down <i>as</i> the GM is describing an encounter and thus eliminating the wait. If it's just a big featureless field or something, I'll lay out the battlemat that comes with the DMG instead, which is even quicker.<br/><br/>Folks are right that it's hard to create a really <i>big</i> area, though with the big big tiles from 4 sets (6 8X10 tiles, and 4 8X8s in all), I do all right. One thing that would be nice is more customized room furnishings, but that could probably be supplemented from other sources like Skeleton Key.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cyberdrake" title="cyberdrake"><img alt="cyberdrake" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cyberdrake">cyberdrake</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122825/#Comment_122825" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-29T16:44:02+00:00" title="January 29, 2008  4:44PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you go to <a href="http://www.dreamweavedworlds.com" rel="nofollow">Dream Weaved Worlds</a> website, you'll find near 200 eight by eight inches gaming tiles of many different sets (Forest, Village, Dungeon, Cave, Fortification, Tower and more).

What with all the rules for flanking, five foot steps, etc. A player that's more tactical oriented can visually demonstrate where his or her character is, which opponents are pinned and where the flanking rogue is. With a large amount of tiles being used, set up can be a distraction as the GM effectively has to hit pause on the action and place the tiles. The alternative, of course, is to follow the Descent route and just lay out the tiles completely before play. Though it gives out of character knowledge of what the terrain looks like, it shouldn't be all that big a deal.<br/><br/>Granted, I've used the material to map 21 8"x11" sheets of tiling then layed them out accordingly.

They can even have their costumes changed, which is something I've found my platers very keen on.<br/><br/>Of course Playmobil is larger than most gaming minis, which is fine for a battle mat but less good for tiles. I got around this by using a combination of paper / mats and Playmobil buildings. The buildings are the best scenery I have ever used, because they give you height, windows, opening and closing doors and all the rest ... and they are robust, and can be dismantled in play. On the other hand I happen to have loads and loads of Playmobil ... and most people don't <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>That aside let me still recommend the figures, even on their own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123023/#Comment_123023" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-30T09:53:33+00:00" title="January 30, 2008  9:53AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ditto Lego; and you can make whatever you want, not limited to houses or particular sets.
