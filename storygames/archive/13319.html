I wasn't massively familiar with the rules but fortunately Dan signed up for my game and he'd played it several times. The idea is that the characters are bound together in running away from some great threat in the pursuit of some great prize. The default setting is The Running Man but that didn't appeal so we chose Dracula. The checkpoints were Escape from Dracula's Transylvania (were everyone person, animal or blade of grass is his), Take the Mace with the Splinter of the One True Cross from the Tower of London and Return to Dracula's Transylvania (where every etc ...) to find his Tomb. We were all members of the King's College 1874 Transylvania Expedition, an Alcoholic Doctor, Oblivious Vicar, Trigger Happy Brigadier, Hot Blooded Vicar's Daughter, Fraudulent Archaeologist and Cowardly Academic. The set-up, which includes a prologue for each character introducing them and the danger, was quick, produced a decent background in which to play and gave us strong indication of the themes which would emerge. The dice flicking system, in which you have to roll close to an ever growing tower of dice without knocking it over, is fun and produces genuine involvement from the players. All signs pointed to a great game. And yet ...<br/><br/>The first act was fine we encountered the Count in the prologue and then fled from the various dangers. Everyone made their rolls and so the fiction ticked over perfectly in time. Then it all went a bit pear-shaped in the second act. The problem is that when you make your rolls, you know how many scenes it's going to take until you get the required victory points for a scene (usually three or four). If you fail a lot of rolls, or don't even make them because the tower is high (which it is by the second act) and you knock it over before rolling then you start to run foul of the fiction, especially if you fail the last roll repeatedly.<br/><br/>So, for example, if you're trying to get into the Tower and you need a key but you've only got 3 of 9 required VPs. You've got 4 VPs riding on the scene so you might expect the next scene to be the last one in pursuit of the key. So you have to set the scene so that it's close to the end but not so close that if you fail you're any nearer the end. Alternatively you could go for something close but then have a big setback, so burgling Number 10 Downing St means you get arrested if you fail. If you do get arrested then escape from prison is the simple objective although I don't know what you'd do if you failed that. So, as you can see, you have to be really careful when describing scenes. Given that all had gone smoothly in the first act, we didn't approach the second with enough care and the mood fell a bit flat.<br/><br/>The third act worked a bit better, but even then we had to introduce what seemed like extraneous fictional elements to cope with the fact that we failed rolls. I think I'd like it better if you succeeded but failures just count against you in the final act (which they do anyway because lower health means you have to throw the dice in progressively more awkward ways). There may also be a tendency to call for many rest scenes in the final act to rebuild health. I think we only had two rest scenes and that because the tower had got to 13 height, not to make it any easier at the end.<br/><br/>The finale was pretty good although the chance of winning was pretty low. We managed to do 8 of the 16 rolls required and the four deaths contributed a further 1 VP each which meant we'd killed Dracula but died in the attempt. This is a game in which skill at dice is a requisite for success.<br/><br/>So overall I think we probably did it just but maybe it's just not really my cup of tea.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299969/#Comment_299969" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-09T04:53:49+00:00" title="November  9, 2010  4:53AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 9, 2010 5:00AM by Sebastian.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Steve, awesome frame!<br/><br/>Escaping from Dracula is a gorgeous idea. There's two things I'd like to address here, especially for anyone planning to play Hell for Leather themselves. First, I'd like to address the issue of Checkpoints (which I believe is one of the difficulties of the change-the-format session). Secondly, I'd like to address the problem of failure in your game (something I think that could be fixed with a house rule, for example).<br/><br/>One of the big flaws of Hell for Leather is the problem of Checkpoints. It's such a problem that I even did a podcast (<a href="http://cobwebgames.com/index.php/making-of-hfl-3/" rel="nofollow">it's 12 minutes long</a>) about it at the end of October.<br/><br/>Briefly, the players must pick three tasks for the characters during the setup phase. If the players choose a Checkpoint that is either<br/><br/>a) too easy; <br/>b) too vague; or<br/>c) too narrow<br/><br/>you get into problems. Pages 69-71 of the book offer advice about these issues. To rip some text directly from the book:\n<blockquote><b>Tip: Checkpoints</b><br/>Make sure every Checkpoint is <b>impossible</b>, <b>specific </b>and <b>open</b>.<br/><br/><b>Impossibility </b>ensures that the task will require several steps <br/>for its execution. <i>Example: \u201cSteal the ship\u201d is okay, but \u201cSteal the <br/>submerged submarine\u201d is impossible!</i><br/><br/><b>Specificity </b>ensures clarity. <i>Example: \u201cKidnap an official\u201d is okay, <br/>but \u201cKidnap the First Lady\u201d is specific!</i><br/><br/><b>Openness </b>(room for interpretation) ensures emergent <br/>strategies. <i>Example: \u201cAct as the presidential chauffeur in order <br/>to capture the president\u2019s wife\u201d is not open for interpretation, but <br/>\u201cKidnap the First Lady\u201d is perfect!</i><br/><br/>Be specific for the \u201cwhat\u201d and open for the \u201chow.\u201d That is, the <br/>objective should be clear while the practicalities of its completion <br/>remain mysterious.</blockquote>\nApplying that advice to your Checkpoints, I think that Checkpoint 2, "Take the Mace with the Splinter of the One True Cross from the Tower of London," probably ran foul of impossibility and openness. Perhaps it would have been more appropriate if you had written "Steal the One True Cross from the Knights of the Rose," for example?<br/><br/>Anyway, these Checkpoint guidelines illuminate flaws/features with the game itself. If you write up the proper kind of huge-scale, action movie Checkpoints, you're less likely to bump into those other bits, but still, for some, those flaws/features exist. What I'm talking about here, mainly, is the problem of failing. When you fail in Hell for Leather, you accumulate more dice for your dice tower, and eventually, they topple and the characters get injured. The game is supposed to be hard. However, it's also supposed to be fun.<br/><br/>If you're setting up a story and you're enjoying the pacing of the game, failures in Hell for Leather can feel like creative blocks. You're telling the story one way and then, whammo, the dice fall. Suddenly, your story is stopped dead. Where do we go from here? And so on.<br/><br/>The trick is in the "If You Fail..." clause used at the beginning of the Challenge. On the one hand, you know what happens when you succeed. The "If You Fail..." clause is supposed to tell everyone what happens when you don't. And, it is supposed to be driven by the character's Flaw. This is supposed to provide the other player with the chance to push the game in a new direction. For me, this is a feature. I like being able to fail people in new directions. For lots of people, this is not a feature. It feels like a creative block. For those people, I'm sorry. You could try this easy fix: whenever a player fails, they still contribute all of their story pips to the pot. That way, you are always <i>failing forward</i>.<br/><br/>Alternatively, you can ensure more success by adding in Violence. I love it when my character fails to complete his actions, puts the team in an even worse situation, and pushes the story into a negative spiral. Because it forces me to think about using Violence in order to succeed. That, for me, is a feature of the game. Again, for others, it's a big flaw.<br/><br/>In summary, Hell for Leather is a great beer &amp; pretzels game, where everyone can do gore and violence and listen to a B-Movie for a couple of hours. It has been used to do other things, but only by accident. I don't think it's the best game in the world, and I don't think it's moving or special, but it is exciting and silly and fun. And a good cross/polination tool for non-gamer geeks. If you set it up for big scale tasks, try to push failure on your friends in fun, plot moving ways, and use Violence to solve your issues, you're going to get something out of it that you can't get from other games. But what you get out is not always going to be what <i>you</i> (the anonymous indie gamer person) were looking for. So, before you spend money on this game or set up the table for a night of play, think about this: are you interested in finding out how a bunch of misfits get slaughtered as they try to escape something? Are you prepared to tell a full-on genre story with all the clich\xe9s in the book? Are you on board with the idea that stacking dice is going to determine how successful you are? If not, stop.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Suna" title="Suna"><img alt="Suna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Suna">Suna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299971/#Comment_299971" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-09T04:57:39+00:00" title="November  9, 2010  4:57AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 9, 2010 4:58AM by Suna.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Waow.

I did look at a page with checkpoint descriptions and the word I saw most was not 'impossible' but 'big'. Perhaps it was a different page to the one you quote. From what you say about narrative pacing, I think we could probably have done a better job and I like the idea of failure not holding the story back too much. I think if I did play it again, I'd use this to a certain extent. Possibly seeing whether the mood of the table was to reasses our options (i.e. take the failure) or to press on regardless (i.e. take the VPs).<br/><br/>I'd certainly like to see Stalker done as a game (or Nova Swing, the MJ Harrison examination of similar tropes) but I'm not sure that Hell for Leather isn't perhaps a little too energetic for it. Of course, I could be wrong.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301230/#Comment_301230" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-18T05:09:05+00:00" title="November 18, 2010  5:09AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'd certainly like to see Stalker done as a game (or Nova Swing, the MJ Harrison examination of similar tropes) but I'm not sure that Hell for Leather isn't perhaps a little too energetic for it.
