If so, there's an indie/small press panel Friday and Saturday that needs participants.  Contact Dave Silva at Dave@housedok.com for more information.  <br/><br/>Shane (Delta Green, Wild Talents), Sam Chupp (Wraith and Changling), Fred Hicks (Dresden Files, Spirit of the Century, Don't Rest Your Head), Eloy (Apocalypse Prevention, Wu Xing - the Ninja Crusade), and others have participated.  I was there the year before last mainly explaining my participation in playtesting and work on Realm Guard (the free Mouse Guard/Fourth Age of Middle Earth Hack).  <br/><br/>We'd love to see you.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
