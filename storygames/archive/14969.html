Let's celebrate by writing short reviews of games that don't exist.<br/><br/><i>Split The Loot</i> is a whimsical little game based around, as you might guess, splitting the loot. The default "skin" is a group of fantasy adventurers dividing the spoils of their latest expedition into the Dungeon. There's a fairly large amount of gold, and a number of Indivisible Goods that isn't evenly dividable by the number of players, that the players themselves come up with (although there's a few examples, such as "A ruby the size of a man's fist" or "a finely crafted sword, heavily engraved with brightly glowing runes"). Interestingly, it's entirely up to the player how their character values the Indivisible Goods, but it's still a game-significant choice: you write down your appraisal, but keep it secret, and at the end of the arguing, haggling, and bargaining, and there's a fairly clever bit of comparing relative appraisals of goods (the short version: you get one point for everyone that you estimate you got a better deal than, and a point for everyone who in their own estimation got a worse deal than you)<br/><br/>There's a few flashback-invoking key phrases like "You Owe Me!" and "That's Not How I Remember It!" but they don't really have any systemic force behind them, which is a bit unfortunate (but it does keep the negotiations fairly elegant while still providing some colorful scenes). I wouldn't call it a full "game", or at the very least, not a game that would take an entire typical session to run, but as a diversion to play while you're waiting for the entire group to arrive, or a "warm up exercise" or the like. Or, as the author suggests, you could even use it as an add-on to your existing fantasy system, with a small XP boost for winning.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340307/#Comment_340307" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-24T07:15:32+00:00" title="August 24, 2011  7:15AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 24, 2011 7:48AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My friends and I experienced a fit of nostalgia last week and pulled out West End's <b>Tremors Roleplaying Game</b>. Remember that? I still maintain that Tremors was the most elegant and innovative implementation of the D6 system. The tremor die simultaneously drives play and forces the players to make highly thematic choices. One thing that is rarely mentioned about T:TRPG is how well it emulates the serio-comic tone of the original film. The box was dusty and battered, but when we opened it we were in for a treat - not only were all the little stand-ups still there, but so were the characters from Steve's first campaign, back in 1991-92. We had a blast playing again! I think the big difference between then and now is that this time we were all eager to roll the tremor die as often as possible!<br/><br/>Did anybody else play Tremors? Did anybody get the weird 1997 expansion they only made a few hundred of? I've never seen it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340308/#Comment_340308" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-24T07:27:01+00:00" title="August 24, 2011  7:27AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Today I looked at the cover art and read the back cover copy of a shrinkwrapped version of the late John Wick's most recent game <i>Trompe L'oile</i>.

So I was intrigued!<br/><br/>But.... okay. So when you do something risky or uncertain, every player who thinks of a possible outcome (the scope of which are modified by fiddly traits, some of which are based on circumstances, some of which are based on meta factors) announces it as a parallel universe diverging from that point. Then all players roll 3d6 (you can spend Flow for a reroll, if you've got it), and the high roller decides which parallel universe to follow.<br/><br/>And obviously, you all can travel between parallel universes. Except... travel between parallel universes is explicitly a risky and uncertain action.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I enjoy recursion, and <i>think</i> I've wrapped my head around how that works, but regardless of whether or not it's actually playable (I have my doubts) I know <i>I</i> would never get <i>my</i> group to play it.<br/><br/>That said, the factions of parallel-universe travelers are pretty cool. If I ever <i>do</i> get the opportunity to play this game, I'm totally playing a Circler.

The game is played by two correspondents, each of which is a seeker after a different terrible truth. Each must name this truth with some kind of nonsense word (typically something backwards such as Egnaro or Drawoh) but never describe it. The players exchange letters in which they reveal a piece of the puzzle at each stage, not in a linear fashion, but in revealing that what the other person last wrote was somehow incomplete, wrong, untrustworthy or falsehood. For example, the story of a Dutch cartographer can be shown to be the invention of Russian nationalists seeking to discredit the Dutch position in India. It is important that each letter contain many references, most of which should be true but some of which should be invented. JLB wrote one such letter to HPL but the latter having been dead for 38 years, he received no answer.<br/><br/>My only personal experience of the game was ten years ago when I was engaged in an exchange of letters with the local Inland Revenue office regarding my tax code. Over the series of letters it became apparent to me that there was a particular turn of phrase which I should have to use for the IR to give me the appropriate code. In return the IR made vague allegations about my activities in France and later as a short order cook in the UK but it was not clear to me the nature of the response they expected and I didn't want to show my hand too soon. Unfortunately I no longer have the correspondence, it having fallen from an attic window, however I do retain a not too unpleasant memory of this time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340315/#Comment_340315" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-24T08:37:04+00:00" title="August 24, 2011  8:37AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was excited and disappointed at the same time with Avalon Hill's 25th Anniversary Edition of the "The Lighthouse." The classic game of New England "fog" horror was ground-breaking with it's mixture of miniatures and roleplaying. Usually miniature games in the era would just allow for flaking bonuses and zones of control from this historic game company that once brought us Diplomacy. But in this game, Avalon Hill made something entirely unexpected, mixing board placement with it's unique turn-based roleplaying. The timer was a nice touch 25 years ago. But all of that is gone now. Granted the new book is gorgeous. The art is finally liveable. And the graphics don't look like a child pasted it together. But that old-school "risky" design feel is gone. With all that new polish on the outside, the soul of Lighthouse is gone. The mystery is no longer mysterious. I mean, the Fog has stats now, as if you can kill it. And the old stance mechanic has been replaced with a deck of cards. Really? If you remember the nuance of the old system this is going to bother you. However, if you're a new player, looking for a new take on the old mysteries of New England Horror, you can't go wrong with the source material here, which encapsulates the old book, both of the expansions, the three adventures, and the one-time article in General magazine. Plus there's some new stuff as well. Sorry. I'm sounding like a Lighthouse nerd here, but I really did love the old one. Might have to dust it off and play it again, while this one takes up space on my game shelf. Sorry. But this one is just a C+.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340316/#Comment_340316" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-24T08:38:53+00:00" title="August 24, 2011  8:38AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Today I looked at the cover art and read the back cover copy of a shrinkwrapped version of the late John Wick's most recent game<i>Trompe L'oile</i>.

The system uses a d20 hack and 76 pages of random tables to give the players the experience of a walk through the gardens of Destiny, allowing them to look back on their lives and see what could be of them now if they had taken different choices. A quick NPC generator allows the players to introduce in the game characteristics from people they have actually met once before, leaving the GM (or <i>Guardian del Destino</i>, in the book) empowered to play these people with their precise point of view and quirks. <br/><br/>The garden itself ressembles a labyrinth and as a player you are confronted to the decision of taking different paths once you find a "bifurcation" (defined by an important choice you had made in your life). However, whenever you look back you will find a single path behind you. A bolivian flamer on the mentioned forum claims Neil Gaiman stole this for a chapter of Sandman, though it seems unlikely since the author of the book claims to have been inspired by a Uqbar newspaper strip. The person who posted the link says that the original book came on a Shroedinger boxed set (meaning there was a 50% chance you find nothing once you opened the box), along with an Aleph for inspirational purposes and a crude d20 dice in cardboard, to be assembled by the players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin" title="Chris_Goodwin"><img alt="Chris_Goodwin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/104/nWRZN6AU4P4W8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin">Chris_Goodwin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340328/#Comment_340328" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-24T09:58:07+00:00" title="August 24, 2011  9:58AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Would I be remiss in pointing out the RPG.net review of the classic <a href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/9/9473.phtml" rel="nofollow">Kriegkinder Achtung</a>?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/halski" title="halski"><img alt="halski" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/halski">halski</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340343/#Comment_340343" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-24T10:58:15+00:00" title="August 24, 2011 10:58AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I recently got a hold of <b>Velvet Underground</b>.

Never did I visit without going to this room.<br/><br/>It was what I always considered a life size model of a dragon. Built of wood and bamboo, it rested on a wire frame with neatly articulated legs, face and claws. Horns and plumes streamed behind it. The body was covered with scales, each a small blank shield the width of the two first joints of my index finger and the length of my nine-year-old thumb.

The premise was that in some way, the characters' old shame was revealed, or threatened to be revealed, or revived in publication, and they had to cover it up, embrace it, disown it, or somehow achieve closure in their feelings about the first things they wrote. The amazing thing is that the mechanics completely dealt with the Czege-principle concerns that plague even the best GM-less designs to this day, and provided enough direction to head off exquisite corpse fiction without feeling railroad-y - the replay value was amazingly high for such a thematically focused game.<br/><br/>Of course, since now he's a two-time Diana Jones honoree, if you give him a copy to sign, he'll hand you a $20 and tear it up.

Based on a work by Charles Stross, this GM-less game gives the players the opportunity to play super-intelligent AI simulacra of lobsters, reified in a cyberspace aboard a micro-sized spaceship.<br/><br/>The mechanics were pretty nifty, with the "Query" and "Resplend" rules giving a refreshing feeling of "otherness" to the mindset of a (simulated) lobster.  The virtual-world setting allows for ample creativity and control from the players, including the opportunity for any player to accelerate or decelerate time, which both changes the rate (and nature) of conflict-resolution, as well as modifying the "Eschaton", which serves as a clock for the session.<br/><br/>Maybe the oddest element was the random encounter table -- at first I assumed it was a kind of pastiche of old-school dungeon crawls, but with the other players enacting the "encounter" as alternate superimposed images of your character's personality vector (I think!), the overall feel was more like the inner monologue of an autistic therapy patient.  It was challenging for the first few scenes, but as we got the hang of it, we really started to enjoy exploring each character's "projective reactions".  I will say that from glancing through the text, I'm very thankful we had a facilitator during our session. The rules could use a lot more examples.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to it getting out of beta.  The author is still working out the campaign rules, but I trust she'll do a bang-up job. I'm definitely going to buy the print version.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/steven807" title="steven807"><img alt="steven807" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/steven807">steven807</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340412/#Comment_340412" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-25T00:39:06+00:00" title="August 25, 2011 12:39AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2011 11:06AM by steven807.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            BTW, I should mention that the next table over was playing the new "Mad Men" RPG, from Margaret Weis Productions.

Still, <b>Battle Not With Monsters</b> has a few interesting bits to it. The biggest one for me is that it really focuses on the adolescence of the main characters as a significant feature: each PC has a "Child" stat and an "Adult" stat, and certain in-game actions can cause you to lose points from the former and gain points in the latter. Child, among other things, is used to resist injury and negative consequence, so it's interesting that the game definitely gets gritter and more serious as you "grow up".<br/><br/>The game is still in playtest, and it definitely shows, though. Even after an email discussions with the author I'm <b>still</b> not sure how to use the "Glitch" trait. If how I understand it is right, even a single Mysterious Beast with "Glitch" can break the entire game, which I suspect might be intentional? Also I'm not sure if the trait's cost is supposed to be a joke or what. It's definitely a sacrifice of playability for artistic integrity, which may or may not appeal to you, but if it doesn't it's the only real offender and easily enough house-ruled out of existence.

I only played it once, but it was great to be able to hum a few bars of the terribly overwrought songs I wrote in the mid-to-late 90s and get Nathan and Dev to help me fill in the missing pieces of how Azrael, Sandras, and Adri struggled against the massive amount of misery in the world triggering the arrival of the four horsemen of the apocalypse.  There's a really clever mechanic where you mix randomly drawn emo-tastic words like "revenge," "always," "fools," and the like into your recited lines, while the other players try to keep a straight face and not lose it completely.  Honestly, it really felt like playing that game, both honoring and mocking an amazingly naive creative project from my youth, enabled me to exorcise a lot of the demons (no pun intended) that still lingered from that period of my life and come to peace with it.

It's just a simple deck of cards; every five minutes somebody has to draw a new one and follow the instructions printed thereon. After a few rounds, Steve was "Hovering By The Drinks Table," Anna was "Staring at the Bookshelf," I was "Flirting With Somebody You Think is Cute," and Christy was "Telling That Same Joke You Told Last Week." This all struck me as sort of intriguingly absurdist and cleverly sinister. But we were all waiting for the big card that would introduce some striking plot element into the game ("Summon an Elder God," perhaps? Or at least maybe "Teleport into the Kitchen"?). <br/><br/>It never really came. The dramatic highlight came when Steve pulled "Throw a Punch at your Enemy," but since we hadn't been told who his enemy was, he just pounded on a sofa cushion for a  few minutes, which seemed kind of lame. Also, as the hours passed, more and more of the cards seemed to be telling us to consume alcohol. In the end, after about seven drinks apiece, we "accidentally" misplaced the deck and settled in for a tipsy but pleasant round of <b>Fiasco</b>.

saw <b>Philadelphia</b>, the game based on the movie with Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington. <br/><br/>Except that it wasn't, really.

There is a set progression for the game, which takes place in three "acts."</p>\n<p>The first act details the rehearsals for an infamous concert conducted by Arnold Schoenberg, the father of atonalism, in which he presented his own music and that of his two prize students, Anton Webern and Alban Berg. Players portray members of the orchestra, struggling to cope with the new atonalism brought to bear by Schoenberg and his disciples. Some may embrace the novel approach, some resist it, and some may find themselves questioning the very idea of "music" and their role in propagating the art form.</p>\n<p>The second act transfers the action to the concert hall on the night of the concert. Players portray members of the audienceas Schoenberg steps up to the podium, and begins to conduct Webern's <em>Six Pieces for Orchestra</em>. Webern's alien, aphoristic aesthetic is like nothing the characters have ever heard - how do they react? The next piece is Schoenberg's own <em>Chamber Symphony</em>. As the other members of the audience begin to stir and protest, the player characters must take a stand. Are they for or against? Finally, faced with Berg's <em>Altenberg Lieder</em>, disturbances begin to break out and the characters must fight or flee as the concert is abruptly terminated by the theater management.</p>\n<p>The third act takes place during a court case addressing a suit brought following the concert. The assertion is that the music itself had caused nervous disorders among certain members of the audience. As the jury in the case, will the characters award damages to the plaintiff, potentially bankrupting the Atonalists, or will they rule for the defendants and suffer the threats and derision of their neighbors and friends?</p>\n<p>There's a lot to love here. Each act is its own mini-game with different mechanics ideally suited to the situation. The first act's finely-tuned musical combat mechanic, pitting players against the conductor, is an innovative gem. The second act engages the Mob mechanic the author originally developed for his earlier game <em>Watts</em>, and hones it into a fine system for modeling the increasing outrage of the bourgeoisie in the face of so-called progress. The in-game use of the actual compositions (included on a CD with the Deluxe Hardback Edition) is an added bonus. The real gem, though, is the third act's appropriation of the dance-off from <em>Sea Dracula</em>, transforming it into a 12-tone "hum-off" requiring the players to remember tone rows from the music played during Act 2.</p>\n<p>In all, <em>The Altenberg Riots</em> is a fascinating exploration of a little-known corner of music history. It would also serve as a great "gateway" game for all of your musicologist friends.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340800/#Comment_340800" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-29T06:32:07+00:00" title="August 29, 2011  6:32AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 29, 2011 6:32AM by thadrine.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>the late John Wick</blockquote>\nAm I missing something?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/edomaur" title="edomaur"><img alt="edomaur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/182385/apple_scale_avatar.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/edomaur">edomaur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340801/#Comment_340801" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-29T06:51:50+00:00" title="August 29, 2011  6:51AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No. We are still in the No-existant-rpg-reviews thread, with Non-quietly-exact-informations-about-authors and other niceties.<br/><br/>Like :<br/><br/>I was wondering if someone had the honor to play with Dr.Tolkien in his <b>Middle Earth</b> settings ?

Some of these became instant classics (like the <b>Fantasy Island</b> game where the GM plays Mr Roarke).  Others were less successful, and left their companies drowning in debt.<br/><br/>The Dukes of Hazzard game is one of the latter group.  The basic premise is actually pretty good for a roleplaying game (gamers love being heroes outside the law).  And the rules have a few good ideas: every session is about building up resources to use in the mandatory final chase scene.  <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the system's flaws kept it from being a success.  The random character creation was wildly unbalanced. (They don't even stat up Bo and Luke as NPCs?  Apparently, they assume you will play additional Duke family members, like the regrettable Coy and Vance.)  The resource building phase is easily gamed to generate infinite resources.  The "<i>Bridge is Out</i>" card is brokenly powerful, while other cards are ambiguously worded.  <br/><br/>In the end,<b> The Dukes of Hazzard RPG</b> failed to gain a foothold against juggernauts of the industry like <b>The Cheers Game</b> or to find a niche among indie gamers the way<b> St. Elsewhere Storytelling</b> did.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340848/#Comment_340848" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-29T13:47:30+00:00" title="August 29, 2011  1:47PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 30, 2011 11:22AM by NickWedig.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Galveston Adventures</b><br/><br/>If you're anything like me, you begin reading Galveston adventures thinking "What, another retroclone named after a city in Texas?  Does every roleplaying group need to take their houserules for The Dallas RPG and publish them as their own separate game?"  But like many other Dallas heartbreakers, Galveston contains a few really clever, innovative ideas.  I just wish that the designers had been confident enough to discard more of the Old Soap Renaissance baggage and create something more original.  Are we always going to be playing in the field of soap operas set in 1980s era Texas?  Could we at least update the setting to modern day?<br/><br/>Most of the game follows heavily from the original Dallas rpg.  You have the same essential core mechanic, a very similar list of attributes and a set of goals that involve uncovering secrets and gaining control over specific groups or NPCs.  Like many Dallas clones, Galveston adds a combat system, which I feel is a mistake.  It detracts from the real core of the game.  The importance of JR being shot wasn't how he was shot, it was the mystery that arose from there.<br/><br/>You have a pregenerated cast of characters with no character generation rules.  This is fine for some games (I quite like the cast of PCs in <b>King of Houston</b>).  But Galveston's cast is full of wishy-washy uninspiring PCs with dull motivations (e.g., "Goal: Investigate accounting errors at Buck Wapnow's cattle ranch").  This lack of strong situation and drama plagues the entire game.  Who cares who secretly runs the Chicken Hut?<br/><br/>Even though the locations are uninteresting, I do like the rules for secretly seizing control of locations, organizations and NPCs.  There's a secret bidding system, whereby you know when people bid, but not how much.  You can use this to fake out other players in various ways: making several small bids may seem like you're investing more than you really are. One large bid may fly under the other player's radars.  Investigation rolls can reveal some about the bids given, which helps make investigative PCs useful.<br/><br/>When someone finally reveals their secret control, they get a bonus based on how heavily invested they are.  At that point, the secret bidding is closed on that resource, but other players can later reveal they had even more invested in the NPC or group, and that the resource was really working for them.  This makes for entertaining reversals in play.  Once, during our playtest, one player miscalculated his secret total, which led to some rules confusion.  Clearer rules on how to handle this situation would be helpful.<br/><br/>Closely tied into the secret bidding is a system called "Foreshadowing".  Each secret, goal and NPC or group has a list of 5 hints that you can use, and each hint also applies to several different secrets.  On your turn, you can insert into your narration a hint pointing toward one of your secrets, goals or hidden control of a resource.  When you finally win the Big Reveal bonus from bringing out your secret, each hint that you gave adds a multiplier onto the bonus (there's a chart).  but each hint also makes it more likely that an Investigating PC could discover your secret and steal that Reveal Bonus for themselves.  Hints are a risky maneuver, but can really pay off.  This subsystem can make for really interesting play, but it also limits replayability: once you know which hints point where, it becomes easy to steal the Reveal Bonus from another player.<br/><br/>These new mechanics suggest to me that the designers could have made a really interesting, innovative game if they had abandoned some of the ideas carried over from the Dallas RPG.  Or that they had made a setting out of Galveston that had enough drama to really sustain interest in the game.  But as it is, I doubt that this retroclone can survive in an RPG marketplace already overcrowded with Dallas heartbreakers, TV soap systems and big budget licensed television drama games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340851/#Comment_340851" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-29T13:53:27+00:00" title="August 29, 2011  1:53PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite>I tried playing the<b>Commune 1871</b>version of<b>Montsegur 1244</b>, but it felt too railroaded and I didn't like being forced to play an anarchist.</blockquote>\nPersonally, I prefer <b>Comissars on the Collective (roleplaying Vanguardists protecting a Workers' and Peasants' Utopia that never quite was).</b> for my Leftist gaming needs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340869/#Comment_340869" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-29T15:29:47+00:00" title="August 29, 2011  3:29PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 29, 2011 3:39PM by ccreitz.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Of course it's cool now to love Barker, ever since Gardasiyal: The Prince of Skulls won Peter Jackson all those Academy awards.</blockquote> Those were make-up Oscars, honestly, for when <i>Meet the Feebles</i> picked up all those technical awards but didn't get Best Picture. <i>Gardasiyal</i> was just a noisy VFX demo reel, to me.<br/><br/>And how nice would it be if Baker's universe got a real, carefully designed game to support storytelling in T\xe9kumel, instead of that slapdash movie tie-in <i>Empire of the Petal Throne</i>, huh?

was already over, and I think we can all agree that although it was noble of FASA to try to build a publishing community that way, that the long handling times demanded by the rules, plus the

You don't have to play the iconic characters - the errata includes rules for P\xe1chi L\xe9i PC's, for God's sake!

I am however totally fascinated by what was done with <b>Zothique, a final storytelling game</b> : this is a piece of art, a morbid angel of the dying, an evil purple flower. When it was first published, in French, strangely, it was using almost the same simplistic system as <i>Mal\xe9fices</i> with the twist that there was no fixed game master, and that the Destiny Cards were used as a tool to tell how the characters were going to die instead of changing their stats. Today, as <i>Mal\xe9fices</i> reached its third edition, <b>Zothique</b> has a sixth edition, with multiple campaigns and alternate universes (Averoigne, Hyperbor\xe9e, the mythical campaigns "The Empire of the Necromants" and the "Eater of Haschich" and so many horrifying stories). Really, I think that Clark Ashton Smith had a more interesting following in the RPG world than Howard P.

The publication of the 30-year anniversary edition of the <b>MIT Multiverse</b>, complete with two hundred pages of codified house rules including klutz factor magic, mass-battle rules, special ability tables, and your choice of three different authentic critical hit tables, is a real event for those interested in how it was done in the day.  But even more interesting than the rules, are the chapters on running games set in Gorree, Edwyr, Hellsgate and the Gothic Isles, complete with notes and sample adventures from the original game masters.  This interlinked group of campaigns, as chronicled in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Wild Hunt</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Alarums &amp; Excursions</span>, were surprisingly influential in their day.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/edomaur" title="edomaur"><img alt="edomaur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/182385/apple_scale_avatar.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/edomaur">edomaur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340879/#Comment_340879" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-29T16:31:08+00:00" title="August 29, 2011  4:31PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 29, 2011 4:31PM by edomaur.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ccreitz</cite><cite>Posted By: edomaur</cite>( edit : uh, what if I make non-existant games into real ones ? )</blockquote>What indeed?<br/>No reality-destroying paradoxes ?<br/><br/>Ok.<br/><br/>Will do.

You design games - have you ever tried to build anything on the OE engine? It's not really apropos to this conversation, but sometime I'll have to tell you about the disastrous playtest of <i>Horrors</i>, the <i>OpenEarthdawn</i> port of <i>Call of Cthulhu</i>, that I was involved in. There were jokes about "shipping and handling time" and "same day service". Ultimately, FASA recognized that they were just piling on the fad, rather than making a product that players wanted to buy, and wisely abandoned it.<br/><br/>So yeah, a glossy hardcover full of movie stills does not automatically make a game bad. It takes the special magic of good intentions, network-externality greed, and sloppy execution that crystallized into <i>OpenEarthdawn</i> to do that. The ORLi did a lot of damage to the industry, and it's not clear to me that its happy consequences (hi there, <i>Tradecraft</i>) will outweigh that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340889/#Comment_340889" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-29T17:58:09+00:00" title="August 29, 2011  5:58PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, you should take that screed over to www.thestorygamesite.com and see how far it gets you.

And with a magic system that had tricks spanning all the characters like "you know the place to kiss a person to cause them to fall in love with the kisser forever" and worked only as long as few enough people ever learned the secret. <br/><br/>Of course you can't find a copy, Ron erased the thread where it appeared and now every In-doer who still plays it seems to know different rules. Perhaps someday a masked man or woman will find you and yours at a convention and take you for a whirl with it. After all, as <b>Clandestine</b> says "ideas don't die, they just go on holiday".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341038/#Comment_341038" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-31T07:05:25+00:00" title="August 31, 2011  7:05AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DannyK</cite>Fire!

I guess I was wrong about it being the game that would win all the awards that year. <br/><br/><b>Dumnonia</b> - Gateway to the Summer Country By Paul Czege 2006 Half Meme Press $19<br/><br/>Dumnonia is a game about fantasy the way Dogs in the Vineyard is a game about cowboys. It plays like a fantasy mash up of John Crowley and Nicholson Baker or a modern take on Ulysses. It is a game of subtle fantasy encroaching on everyday lives. You play regular people being drawn into the world of fairy that may or may not be there. It doesn't have the same visceral catharsis that something like My Life With Master had but has an enormously appealing quality of its own. <br/><br/>The book itself is something to hold. It has a pearlescent cover with matte printing; the inside pages are a rich cream stock and weighs more than it looks like it should. The book is 8x8 inches and the thing feels like it weighs a pound and a half.  The rules seem spare but covered all of the situations we got our characters into. It took longer to assemble the needed supplies than it did to read the rules. To play the game you need several colors of dice, several colors of tokens two table clothes and a silver bowel. <br/><br/>The game is GM-less, a style I think will gain a lot more acceptance after this. On each turn the other players take turns setting scenes for the spotlight character, with the player to the left having responsibility for introducing the scene and the others for adding elements.  The game is marvelously tight in its mechanics; looking at a characters tokens gives a good impression of what sort of scene the player needs to move to. The characters are measured on the stats Grit, Heart and Destiny; as long as Destiny is greater than the sum of Grit and Heart you know to drag them further into trouble. Once you are there you expand the trouble while they claw their way out. <br/><br/>We set our game in a small summer colony on the edge of Lake Champlain. My character was a sheriff who collected religious paraphernalia, Renee played a ghost who was haunting the local hotel was afraid of moving on, and Matt played an engineer brought in to fix the structural damage that the owners think is causing the supposed ghost sitings. We only played four turns because we had difficulty finding a setting we were all engaged with. Ideally the game would be played out over several sessions but I wanted to be the first with a review. <br/><br/>The mechanics worked very well with the input from the pother players making things move from very normal to very weird without changing much. I think Renee's character got short shrift because she started with something that was already in the weird and we didn't have as far to take her. Renee's concept was that being a ghost was a pretty routine job and that interacting with us would be a move into the weird. She would probably have made a good NPC. Matt's character seemed to get the best play, I didn't call for the shiver dice enough, and when his character kissed the tramp and everything turned into butterflies I almost cried. It was possibly the most affecting scene I have ever witnessed. <br/><br/>If there is a weakness in the game it is that it is too subtle. The game never spells out how to make the other world seem just beyond your reach. Some of our scenes achieved this and others, especially Renee's, seemed to go over the top and you almost expected dwarves to march out of the closet. I suspect though, that this game will usher in a new era where the industry begins to shed some of our traditional love for pure genre and starts modeling tougher standard fiction. Dumnonia is a game which leads the players to confront reality in a different way, it changes you as a player and that is an amazing thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy" title="DeBracy"><img alt="DeBracy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nTIWP6SSS5BV3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy">DeBracy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341041/#Comment_341041" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-31T08:25:05+00:00" title="August 31, 2011  8:25AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh man! Less than an hour ago I complained on Google+ that there aren't any romatic fantasy games other than Blue Rose, but with some google fu and lot of luck I stumbled onto a game called <b>Squire's Oath</b>. I bought the pdf right away and I've looked it over.<br/><br/>It's clear from first glance that the writer's had a a look at both Hero Quest and Mouse Guard. Skills and conflicts work a lot like HQ, but skills are advanced like in MG with successful and failed rolls. There's some sort of artha-like system of points tacked onto the whole thing too, but I haven't had time to read how it works yet. Seems you can use the points to buy both rerolls and to introduce stuff into the fiction (there's an example where one of the players introduce a winged cat as an unexpected ally - very genre appropriate!).<br/><br/>The thing I like the best about the game so far is that there are some pretty ritualistic parts to play. All the player character's start out as the Queen's squires so every session starts with the player's reciting the Squire's oath. As play progresses the characters can achieve titles or ranks (each with it's on requisit), and swear new oaths: the Knight's oath (protect the people, uphold the Queen's law), the Healer's Oath (protect life, help the sick), the Harper's oath (protect people's soul and spirit), the Herald's oath (spread knowledge and news), etc. There are 12 oaths in total, and they're all included and there's a little description of each swearing in-rite which I get the impression that you're supposed to larp more or less. Of course, once you've taken a new oath you don't join the others in reciting the Squire's oath. <br/><br/>It's suggested that players make a new character once their squire graduates to another rank since their old characters are probably going to get orders that take them far away. There's also a sidebar encouraging troupe play since there's going to be a growing gallery of old and new characters.<br/><br/>I've got to read more now, hopefully I'll get some peoaple to try it with me this weekend!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thor" title="thor"><img alt="thor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/thorhansen/Pictures?authkey=Gv1sRgCKPylM61jtOQbA#5529849930194336866"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thor">thor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341045/#Comment_341045" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-31T09:12:04+00:00" title="August 31, 2011  9:12AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.wired.com/beyond_the_beyond/2011/08/beyond-the-beyond/" rel="nofollow">Beyond the Beyond</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341067/#Comment_341067" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-31T10:42:18+00:00" title="August 31, 2011 10:42AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2011 10:44AM by NickWedig.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: thor</cite>Beyond the Beyond</blockquote>\nI'm confused by every part of this.

Cartoon characters, absurdity, mystery investigation, the whole deal.  Only this time we have humanoid cartoon characters, a la Tintin, and recursive literary meta-critique replacing the dance contest.  The game is probably bet summarized as "<i>House of Leaves</i> meets <i>Scooby Doo</i>."  I don't know if that clarifies anything, though.<br/><br/>It's the last part that really causes problems.  You're supposed to have your PCs symbolize the subtext of their own story in order to manipulate the outcome towards the end that you want.  So suppose you want to have your teenage spy clamber across the Berlin Wall.  (The setting is "somewhere in the 20th century".  Nazis, Communists and bomb throwing anarchists all appear as antagonists.)  You might accomplish this by explaining how your protagonist represents youthful optimism triumphing over cynicism.  Or you might argue that crossing the Berlin Wall back into West Berlin is analogous to the Hero's homecoming at the end of Joseph Campbell's <i>The Hero With a Thousand Faces</i>.  Your opponent, however, might argue that your job as a spy is symbolic of a larger morally ambiguous world of international politics, or that the Berlin Wall represents the fundamental divisions between humans: you will never fully know or understand anyone you meet.  Either interpretation implies the same thing for the story: you fail to make it over the wall and be reunited with your girlfriend, and instead you are shot dead by the border guards.<br/><br/>So you and anyone else involved gives their critique of the story so far (in character), then the group decides which interpretation is correct and the story unfolds from there ("Haha, you neglected to pay attention to the neo-Marxist subtext of your own soliloquy. Victory is mine!").  The rules are unfortunately a bit vague on what happens if the group can't agree on which is the right interpretation, which is quite unfortunate.<br/><br/>I'm real keen on trying this out in play, but the rest of my group is wary.  They want the meta-critique to be encompassed in a more traditional mechanics like Sea Dracula's dance-off.  "Why can't we have a yodeling contest, and the winner can then describe their analysis of the story?" they ask.  I tried to explain to them that literary analysis is really just another performance art, but they didn't buy that.<br/><br/>(Even if I did get them to play, I know one guy would be going for Jesus allegories everywhere.  Biblical parallels are broken, yo.)<br/><br/><br/>Still, it seems like a cool system.  I'm working on a hack to run <i>Doctor Who</i> as <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/98083/The-triumph-of-intellect-and-romance-over-brute-force-and-cynicism" rel="nofollow">the triumph of romance and intellect over brute force and cynicism</a>.
