It made me snap to attention. I also like that it covers multiple perspectives, for example we don't just see a breakdown of potential sexism in Dragon Magazine covers but also the editor's response to the potential issue. We have multiple pieces to the puzzle to help us form our own opinions.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tully305" title="Tully305"><img alt="Tully305" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tully305">Tully305</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297079/#Comment_297079" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-16T05:15:57+00:00" title="October 16, 2010  5:15AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, there are some pretty awful things in those links.<br>\n<br>\nReminds me of my last job where I worked at a Doemstic Violence agency where I organized a group of male volunteers that helped me go into schools and teach young men about sexual harrassment and ending violence against women.

People read my blog? That's news to me.<br><br>Yeah, um. Doing the research that resulted in the list of links was one of the most unpleasant things I've ever done. I felt angry and out-of-sorts for weeks afterwards, especially after all of the material that I found about sexual harassment. (The fact that I needed to break that category into sub-headings is so depressing.)<br/><br/>Responding to stuff people said in the Stuff to Watch thread:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ColinC</cite>Wow...that really pulls things together. I play in two groups, both of which are (I feel) pretty sensitive in our portrayals of women in the fiction (the all-guy group more so than the mixed one, huh...), so this was eye-opening.<br/></blockquote>\nHonestly, the treatment of women that I've experienced in the indie games community has been mostly positive. That's not to say we get a pass. The sexism of excluding women as protagonists is something that both men and women are guilty of (myself included). But I've certainly never encountered anything as cringe-worthy as things like EA Fail or the Jade Raymond incident within the indie community.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ColinC</cite>First thing that popped into my head when I read the editor's response from Dragon Magazine: 'Ah, ok. So basically Dragon is FHM or Maxim for geeks. It all makes total sense now.'</blockquote>\nOn the one hand, it makes sense. I mean, they're running a business, right? But on the other hand, it's definitely a disappointing response.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>Agreed! I bet it wouldn't be too hard to get funding and support for a book.<br/></blockquote>\nI started swearing at Simon through email when I realized that this probably is a book. I even have an outline on my hard drive and a pretty monstrous collection of awful game ads that I've been collecting. The only thing that puts me off is the huge issue of copyright, since a lot of the images I need to cite are pretty clearly copyrighted and I don't imagine the large and very rich companies who own the games in question would be too happy with me.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297207/#Comment_297207" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-18T08:42:57+00:00" title="October 18, 2010  8:42AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, using material like that for academic purposes (media analysis, etc.) has a long, proud tradition, so I think you're probably okay.
