That way they would still have gotten something worthwhile by getting in early, other people would be able to get the super-deluxe version, and it would still maintain its exclusivity. Honestly, I don't get making things exclusive, beyond the obvious Kickstarter-exclusive perks.

Especially when dealing with things hand-personalized and one of a kind, I don't want to overpromise to please customers initially if it means risking disappointing them with the finished product. Even 25 of these copies is an ambitious thing\u2014 well, 28 when you include the three super-fancy leatherbound copies at the $300 level.<br/><br/>I'm sorry!

But there is one thing I'm hung up on, and I want to see if anyone can "unstick" me, or if this is just a preconception of Judeo-Christian religion/mythology that I can't get around.<br/><br/>I am having a hard time with the idea of the angels being cast out because they have compassion for humans.  This has me scratching my head.  How detrimental to the game would it be to change that stat from compassion to passion or obsession?  Each individual player can determine exactly what that means (envy of human status with God, envy of human opportunity on Earth, or romantic love with an individual human, etc).<br/><br/>That's really my only real hangup.  I'm a little sketchy also on the idea of God casting out angels who ask questions, but I can maybe let that one work for me if it can be left unclear exactly WHAT God's plans are for the endgame (i.e. is God right or wrong?).  In other words, maybe there is a possibility (or not) that it's good for Angels to obey tirelessly, just that not all of them do.  And then the age old question of "so why can angels question God at all?" remains a mystery and theme during play that you struggle around.<br/><br/>Does any of this make sense, or am I just too stuck in my perceptions to enjoy this game?

I will try to explain my theological explanations for the (obviously alternate!) mythology the game is based on, and give you some idea of what the game dynamic is, so that you can come up with new ways to skin it that make you less uncomfortable. And I get where you're coming from; as I explained in brief <a href="http://elizabethsampat.com/being-a-part-of-the-things-you-make/" rel="nofollow">on my blog,</a> the whole game dynamic and the relationships between the Fallen, God, and Humanity are based on my experiences as a minister. This is not an anti-Christian game, just as I do not think Vincent would describe Dogs In The Vineyard as an anti-Mormon game. Instead, this is a game that helps me make sense of my own past relationship with Christianity. If that makes sense. <br/><br/>That said! In the world that is THEY BECAME FLESH:<br/><br/>- Angels can choose free will, but Humans are <i>born</i> with free will.<br/>- God does not lack compassion when he casts the Humans out or casts out the Fallen; it is the age-old tightrope of Grace Vs. Free Will. Those who question Heaven cannot live there; to allow them to live there would require God to take the angels' ability to choose free will away.<br/>- God is neither good nor bad, and neither is Lucifer, at least at the beginning of the game. You go into it simply with what you know of their actions: God cast the Humans out of Eden, Lucifer objected and was cast from Heaven. Like with the Fallen themselves, their "rightness" and "wrongness" is established through play.<br/>- No one "is evil" or "is good." Everyone has agendas. This is true especially for PCs: if you want to go in and play "oooh I'm so eeevil," I can't stop you. But I can say that I personally like the game best when you don't go into it with a preconceived idea of wanting to play a redemption story, or a transubstantiation story, or the story of how Lucifer became the MOST EVIL or anything\u2014 when your character just does what they think is best and the chips fall where they may. But that may be heavily influenced by the way I approach life.<br/><br/>So with that said, my suggestion would be to be the God GM and make your God do good? But the book will never tell you who is right or who is wrong. That is up for your group to explore and decide together through play and the actions you choose.<br/><br/>I hope that helps!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Big_J_Money" title="Big_J_Money"><img alt="Big_J_Money" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Big_J_Money">Big_J_Money</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350360/#Comment_350360" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-02T20:25:53+00:00" title="December  2, 2011  8:25PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Check, check, check and check.

Shreyas here.<br/>I have to apologize to all of you. You all put your trust in us and I've let you down. I dropped the ball on shipping and customer service, and you're justifiably upset. Most of all, you want answers.<br/>So, I have an apology and some answers.<br/>I'm sorry.<br/>We have handled this project as a freelancer relationship \u2014 I don't take a cut from sales of TBF. Elizabeth paid me for the work I did on the book, and for my role as fulfillment and CS guy. I've never done this on this scale before; she took a chance on me. On that front, I've really screwed up. It has taken entirely too long to get your stuff shipped out. So I apologize for that.<br/>The truth is, the last time I cleaned the garage, I actually left a box full of TBF packages, ready to ship, in there and lost it in the debris. I was too embarrassed to actually tell you folks that I did that, because it's a stupid thing to do, but there it is. For a while I just didn't know where your stuff was. I apologize for that.<br/>I've also been maintaining a pretty minimum level of contact with you all, and that's unfair to you. I have several emails I'll be sending after I post this to those of you who have contacted me directly. And I apologize for that.<br/>Now I've located the missing inventory (it's undamaged), and I've taken some long evenings making sure that everything is packed and labeled. I'll be double checking that stuff before it goes out to ensure that nothing goes to outdated addresses or anything of that kind.<br/>I want you all to be able to wash your hands of this, and have your Kickstarter rewards in your possession. So I'm taking a few days to deal with unfinished business.<br/>The rest of the outstanding Principalities will go out on December 15th.<br/>For those of you that are waiting on apparel and hardcovers, we're clearing the final hurdles on those processes, and we hope to have them printed and shipped by the end of January. We hope that the community can help keep us accountable on that. Look for updates with hoodie photos and hardcover designs in this coming month."<br/><br/>27/12/2012 "I see that some of you are interested in refunds. I will contact you tonight and make arrangements with you."<br/><br/>no response at all  about Gencon.. ... Elizabeth gets involved in another kickstarter posted 14/1/2013  and comments are made about that.. replies one day later.. so she is reading the comments..<br/><br/>15/01/2013 "Creator Elizabeth Shoemaker Sampat  on January 15  <br/>Jo\xe3o, I'm glad that your shipment finally arrived!<br/>Torolf, yes, it has been some time since I've had the free time to deal with Kickstarter. I have no intention of keeping you separated from your money any longer.<br/>Robby, I ask that you treat the creators of Cortex+ with respect, and understand that we are in no way involved with the customer service or fulfillment for that project. I have every confidence in their work, reliability, and their record of consistent and professional conduct. Cam has always shown himself to be a really excellent project manager, and I honestly believe that if you back out on my account, you're going to miss out on a lot of good work by other Cortex+ collaborators.<br/>"<br/>17/03/2012 "For those of you waiting on hardcovers, because our hardcover printer works mainly with archival photo albums, we have to break down the PDF into individual JPG images for them.
