                    So I started a game of <a href="http://timfire.com/MountainWitch.html" rel="nofollow">The Mountain Witch</a> last night at <a href="http://sgboston.wordpress.com" rel="nofollow">StoryGames Boston</a>. It was really good, and I just wanna talk about it because it was so good!<br/><br/>We're trying to start putting together medium-term multisession games alongside/in addition to our weekly pickup gaming, and I decided to kick this off by running tMW, which I played with Tim at GenCon and have been wanting to run since then. I advertised the game as being for 3-5 players. We had a really big turnout last nite (including special guests!), and I ended up with 5 people interested, in addition to Ben and Alexis, who I knew wanted to play as well. Well, after waiting for them two for a little while, I decided to throw caution to the winds and go for it. They showed up as we were in the middle of character creation, so they jumped in then.<br/><br/>So my Mountain Witch game has...thats right....SEVEN SAMURAI.<br/><br/>So. good.<br/><br/>I took some notes, and I'm sure I misspelled a bunch of stuff, but anyway:<br/><br/>Ben is playing Imato Taro, a Dragon. His abilities are: Issue Orders; Sophisticated; Read Chinese. He ran away from his lord and responsibilities, and needs the money because he is starving.<br/><br/>Alexis is playing Hikaru, a Rabbit. His abilities are: Terrifyingly Loud Kiai; Amazing Sense of Smell; Talented Noh Performer. He sold his family sword, and needs the money to get it back.<br/><br/>Richard is playing Ono Eisaku, a Boar. His abilities are: Related to Mt. Fuji (BEST ABILITY EVER); Vast Weight; Sculp Earth. His master is dead because of his failure in battle, and he needs the money to provide for an appropriate burial for his mother (also a scion of Mt. Fuji).<br/><br/>Eben is playing Oshiro Hiroshi, a Dog. His abilities are: Fat but Agile; Comic Releif; Pithy Trivia. His lord became decadent, dishonorable and mad, and he needs the money in order to provide for his lords daughters, who are still in his charge.<br/><br/>Jon is playing Veda Nanomi, a Rooster. Her abilities are: Dead (OTHER BEST ABILITY EVER); Talk to Birds; Super Ninja Jumping. She is dead, and she needs the money because she bankrupted her descendants in life and now must pay it back.<br/><br/>Dave is playing Sugimoto Kyosu, a Ram. His abilities are: Pretentious DIck; Staredown; Spirit Talking. He failed his master in battle, and he needs the money in order to buy a position in court.<br/><br/>Eric is playing Yamata Sanjuro, an Ox. His abilities are: Geomancy; Blind; Shamison Virtuoso. He misread his lords fortune, and now must repay his lord for all of the goods that he lost because of it.<br/><br/>Whew!                </div>

                            So, what happened?<br/><br/>I'm not going to lie, I was a little intimidated, running a game that I haven't run before (and only played once) for seven people. I took a couple minutes to jot down a couple Bang ideas, and then started the game by having each person describe their Samurai, and how they approached the shrine at the base of Mt. Fuji that was the designated meeting place for the start of their journey. This was a solid device, and I think it helped gel everyone's impression of everyone else's character.<br/><br/>Oh, and I really tried to emphasize how Trust works, and how you can always narrate stuff that has to do with your Dark Fate. I'm really glad that I hit on those points early and often, because the players use of both mechanics was really stellar.<br/><br/>The first full-on scene was the group of Samurai coming upon a lone swordsman with a torch surrounded by a pack of seven wolves in the forest at the base of the mountain. Ben "Dark Fated" (DFed, from hereonin) that the man had the badge of an Imperial servant on his armor, and we began some conflict! It ended up taking a series of 4 rolls to figure everything out, which was a touch long (I didn't really realize that it can take a while to take out large groups of weak creatures). There was good use of Trust and cool characterization by everyone. Jon's character ended up beheading the Imperial servant, and Ben's character took a scroll from his corpse, noticed only by I think David's character. David' character also got his hand bitten through by one of the wolves (a Permanent wound).<br/><br/>The aftermath of the fight had a lot of character-building interaction, now that we had some context for it. Eric and Jon's characters bonded with their crazy supernaturalness (Eric's character, it turns out, does crazy blood magic as part of his Geomancy), and Eben and Richard's characters kind of established themselves as the most "normal" ones of the group. We had another DF about finding the body of another Imperial messenger, and then a short burial scene, at the end of which I started the next conflict.<br/><br/>The Mountain Witch sent a blizzard to confuse and seperate the characters. Eric's character started doing magic to protect them, and pretty much everyone Aided him with Trust, so he totally kicked the blizzards ass. Eben's character decided that he didn't want to take part in the wierdness, and had his own conflict against the blizzard, aided by David (who had no Trust in Eric, and so couldn't Aid him). Jon declared no conflict, and that he wanted to be seperated from the group. He did, however, spend Trust to take narration from Eric and narrate how his character was pushed into the blizzard, and just whipped away by the wind. The blizzard died down, leaving David and Even's characters partially frozen and seperate from the rest of the group, and Jon's character just gone.<br/><br/>I called the end of the First Chapter there - I figured that was a good introduction to the characters, and had sown plenty of seeds for the rising action to come.                        </div>

                            The rest of the night, I pretty much just stole from what Tim did when I played with him.<br/><br/>I asked that everyone adjust their Trust in secret, and then we went around and everyone announced who they adjusted Trust for, and for what reasons. This is a really solid technique, and it went well.<br/><br/>We then started the second Chapter. Eric's character rushed off in search of Jon's, making it known that he has some kind of intense interest in her. His search led the group out of the treeline and onto the slopes of Mt. Fuji proper. Overhead and quite a ways away, they can see the outer ramparts of the Witch's castle - but just ahead is a low stone wall, extending as far as they can see in either direction, and directly in front of them is a gate guarded by two Ogres. The ogres are 8 feet tall, with 4 arms each, tusks and jet-black skin.<br/><br/>This scene took up the rest of the evening, with a lot of back-and-forth, and was really satisfying. I stole this one directly, because I think it is a GREAT scene for this game - the Ogres let it be known that each Samurai can pass through the gate, but only by leaving behind that which they hold most dear.<br/><br/>Now, there was a lot of stuff happening here, so I don't remember exactely what-all went down. But, to my recollection:<br/><br/>Alexis declared that she was not able to leave that, and that they knew it, but they still demanded a symbol. So her character cut off a lock of his hair and gave it into their keeping, and so he passed through the gate.<br/><br/>Ben told them that their Master knew that they need take nothing from him (as a Dark Fate thing), and they let him pass.<br/><br/>Richard, in a DF narration, attempted to pass through them, but they fell on him and crushed him into an underground ice chute. The Ogres crumbled into rock, but reformed once he was in the ground.<br/><br/>Eben gave the Ogres a locket containing the pictures of his Lords daughters that were still in his charge, and so he passed through the gate.<br/><br/>Jon wasn't present in the scene...<br/><br/>Dave broke his sword over his knee, and gave one half to each Ogre. They crushed the sword into powder, and so he passed through the gate - after seeing a vision in the metal dust of Richards character landing on and killing another Ogre at the bottom of the chute, but looking terrified instead of victorious.<br/><br/>Eric did a bunch of crazy blood magic (including healing David's hand, turning it into a Conditional wound - it has to do with both Eric and Bens Dark Fates, so they'll get to say when the penalty kicks in and when it doesn't), and then announced that what he held most dear was already past the gate, or something of the like. And they let him pass...<br/><br/>...following his Shamison to a pile of snow just beyond the gate, in a DF from Jon. <br/><br/>We ended the session with Eric's character digging through the snow, and pulling out two halves of a frozen human heart.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>So, now all we need to do is get these 8 people together for two more sessions!<br/><br/>I was really pleased with how everyone really jumped into the feeling of the game, and used the Trust and Dark Fate mechanics to really drive towards creating bonds of trust while seeding potential for doubt and, later, tragedy. <br/><br/>Anyway, I'm just really happy with how the game went! Comments and questions and such are, as always, welcome.                        </div>

                            I love reading 'The Mountain Witch' reports.  It is definitely on my 'must-play' list.  But GMing it looks fun, too.  Sort of, sit back and watch the cool stuff the players are going to do.                        </div>

                            It's interesting. It's definitely not a sit-back-and-watch role, though I guess it sounds like it from what I wrote. The GM has all scene framing and narrational responsibility, unless a player wins a conflict or they use their Dark Fate to throw something in. The GM also represents the exterior antagonism, the Witch and his servants, and a lot of the fun (for me) is coming up with wierd monsters and really colorful situations in that vein (like the snowstorm, and the two Ogres at the gate).<br/><br/>Also, I think less players would necessitate more traditional GM-centric challenges. For these guys, all I need to do is present a situation, and they'll start going at it within the group. For, like, 3 or 4 players, I think I would have to be working a little harder to give some good discord-sowing material.<br/><br/>Because, really, as the GM in the Mountain Witch, you're not trying to stop the characters from getting up the mountain. You just want to make sure that they kill each other at the top.                        </div>

                            One of the players, Eben, wrote up the second session <a href="http://pooka-madness.livejournal.com/108858.html?view=278586#t278586" rel="nofollow">on his LiveJournal</a>.<br/><br/>My favorite moments:
<blockquote>Hiroshi tried to offer one of the Tengu half a loaf of bread and was likewise met with violence. Hikaru, meanwhile, began reciting a poem even as a Tengu dived towards him. All at once the Tengu received enlightenment, his feathers falling off. He sat in lotus position and had tea with Hikaru while the attack continued. Nanami tackled the Tengu fighting Ieyasu to the ground and, with a little help, killed it. Hiroshi chased around the remaining ungrateful bird-man that had refused his bread, beating it with his sword sheath until it cowered. He chastized it, gave it the bread which had fallen to the ground, and sent it on its way.</blockquote>
and
<blockquote>The party at last approached the entrance to the Mountain Witch's keep. Nanami strode forward and knocked on the doors, which swung open at her touch. As the samurai made their way inside she turned and pressed her hand to Hiroshi's chest, barring his entry. She told him that he was unworthy to enter through these doors and, shaken by his earlier failure, he flinched and allowed her to turn him aside. Ieyasu stepped forward them and demanded to know why. Nanami and Ieyasu had a tense standoff, and just as Hiroshi began making his way back down the path Nanami revealed her Dark Fate; her master, the Mountain Witch, did not welcome Hiroshi to enter. Taro stepped forward to tell Hiroshi that he was in his service, and was still of use. Hiroshi stopped, renewed his resolve and turned to walk alongside the castle wall, insisting that there must be other doors. He informed Taro that he was not in his service; indeed he considered the would-be sovereign in his debt. He passed from the sight of the remaining samurai and Nanami offered to lead them into the Mountain Witch's home. Ieyasu stepped forward then and shrugged, saying simply, "I can lead."</blockquote>
Though we did have one rules dispute and another hiccup, the game went really well overall, I thought. It's shaping up to be quite the conclusion...I just need to work harder to grind down some of their Trust!                        </div>

                            Those abilities are fine indeed. I'm swiping "Pretentious Dick" for my <i>real-life</i> character sheet.<br/><br/>I think it's neat how there's nothing in the rules that mandates it, but sure as shit tengu seem to show up in <b>every</b> game of <i>TMW</i>. And every time it's some totally different take on "tengu."<br/><br/>Also, what Judd said. Cough up!                        </div>

                            Last session has been played, and it was gooooood.<br/><br/><a href="http://community.livejournal.com/nachdemspiel/2488.html" rel="nofollow">Here's the writeup</a>.<br/><br/>We ended with two suicides, a sacrifice, a murder, and two rebirths (one literal, one figurative). My only regret is that I didn't get to throw a Giant into the game before the end...next time.<br/><br/>I'm gonna have an AP about the snags we hit, probably on the Forge, hopefully soon. But, taken as a whole, the game was very solid and immensely satisfying, and I'm really glad I got a chance to run it for such a great group.                        </div>

                            Yeh, that's what Tim did when he ran it for me (and a number of other people) at Gen Con, and I thought it was grand.<br/><br/>Our game had more people than I have colors of poker chips; we ended up using 5 colors of chips (green, blue, red, white and black) as well as red playing cards and black playing cards. It worked out dandy.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Larry</cite>I think it's neat how there's nothing in the rules that mandates it, but sure as shit tengu seem to show up in<b>every</b>game of<i>TMW</i>. And every time it's some totally different take on "tengu."</blockquote>
Given the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tengu" rel="nofollow">diverse representations of tengu in Japanese mythology</a>, that's not really surprising. <br/><br/>Anyway, a good time was indeed had, possibly even by all.                        </div>
