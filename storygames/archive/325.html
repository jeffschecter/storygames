                    I've been hanging on the outskirts of this crowd for several years now, and there's one thing that's always bothered me - we have here an aweful lot of smart, talented people with a keen interest in creating better gaming experiences, and yet no talk of personal skills.<br/><br/>I don't think there's any doubt that there exists such a thing as "better" in roleplaying (at least, <b>I</b> don't have this doubt. Feel free to disagree). It can be said that one GM is better then another (maybe only at certain things), or that a player improved over time. The application of the term itself is considerably more difficult and drags us into all sorts of quagmires, but I hope we can agree on the following:<br/><br/>Everyone strives toward improvement. No one says "I'm too good". There is the exception of those who don't strive toward improvement because they don't strive at all in the area of personal skills, but I have yet to see the case of someone actively striving "to stay put". <br/><br/>Mechanics recieve <i>a lot</i> of attention, and they are only one of three factors going into creating a play session.<br/><br/>Why isn't there any talk about improving personal skills? Why is there no talk about better methods of description, or other means of getting information from the GM to the players or between the players? Why no talk about improvisational techniques? Of using music and other atmosphere enhancers? The list goes on.<br/><br/>This is not a rant, or a taunt - I'd really like to know.<br/><br/>And unless someone can tell me why it's a bad idea (please tell me if you think this is bad idea) I hope to start opening some threads on the subject in the next few days.                </div>

                            Well, personally, I feel like there are a lot of resources out there for improving play skills (roleplayingtips.com and Martin Ralya's Treasure Tables are some I check out regularly), and always have been. But the real particular attention to mechanics and building focused games is new and exciting, and those of us who are into it only congregate in a few places, and in those places its what we want to talk about.<br/>

I see no reason why starting some threads about this would be a bad idea.                        </div>

                            I can improve mechanics a whole lot more than I can improve my personal charisma.  That previous sentence probably proves it.<br/><br/>Erm.<br/><br/>Seriously, though, qualifiable traits gets into that idiosyncratic, "YMMV" territory pretty fast.  I, personally, can't do accents or funny voices.  (I try when running TOON, but I'm just embarrassing myself.)

                            I've got lots of guidelines and suggestions on what to include and how to include it in narration in <em>Full Light, Full Steam</em>.  I've been pretty conflicted about it throughout the book's development, though, because so much of it seems so obvious, and I cringe at making people spend money to buy text that tells them to, say, use all five senses when describing stuff.<br/><br/>In the end, I gave it a hard edit so it's not <em>too</em> long to really bother me, and decided to go with an old teaching axiom which states that no information you present will be utterly new to everyone in the classroom; but everything will be new to at least <em>some</em>one.                        </div>

                            Just a brainfart, but it seems like the mechanics that some games are presenting is an effort to make people listen to each other, which is a basic building block of functional conversation. Is that a roundabout way of training  the sorts of skills you're talking about? Or is the simple artificiality of using system in that way exacerbating the problem? Or neither?                        </div>

                            Improving personal skills is pretty much the point of <em><a href="">The Court of the Empress</a></em>.

                            I'm a big believer in learning by doing. Skill at  improvisation, for example, is not something that I think can be improved to any significant degree by anything but practice. In the realm of role playing games that would be play play play.<br/>
<br/>
As for some of the other more technique specific things you mention, like using music in games, I do see discussion about these things. They are certainly not as frequently discussed as some other subjects but I think that may be due to their perceived weight in helping create a fun, functional play experience. Everyone is pretty busy, and excited about, working on the foundation of rpg structure so that we have something solid to which we can attach all of our cool higher level techniques.                        </div>

<p>Nir,</p>
<p>Please push forward on skills threads!</p>
<p>But as for why I've personally liked to focus on mechanics better, it's that I think for a long time the argument of "skills" were used to pick up the slack for where mechanics could have been doing their job. It's like that old saw, "a good GM can make any game work". That's obviously true, but it's an unfair amount of work for the GM, and a treacherous balancing act. I had a fantastic Mage game last summer (one of my favorite settings) but a lot of that was the great skill and experience of our GM trying to compensate for when the mechanics were impeding getting things done.</p>
<p>But there's always room for more skill.</p>

                            Nir, I think part of the reason may be that many people are scrambling just to find a halfway decent game with fun people to play it with, so their opportunities to work on their own skills is pretty meager.  Whereas we can talk about mechanics design online until the cows come home.  I only recently got involved in a regular, ongoing game where I feel like I can really try out new approaches and attempt to get better.<br/>
<br/>
Also, personally, I know that I not an especially strong player who needs a lot of system support in order to really be effective and that my GM skills are rusty from lack of use (as a recent IRC Nobilis session proved).  In my own case, I see design as a way of helping to account for some of my flaws.  I love the way you build Towns in Dogs, because it gives the GM guidelines for planning out a session.  I like games that encourage players to make more interesting choices than they otherwise would.<br/>

But, yes, bring on the skills threads.                        </div>

Mind you, different people will probably prize different skills. I think it's a great skill to be able to twist a story - to create dramatic moments for others to react to - but that drives some people mad.<br/>
<br/>
Equally, some people I know think it's a great skill to be able to immerse yourself in a character, to react entirely in the moment. And that drives me mad.<br/>
<br/>
But, yes, I'd love to discuss skills.<br/>

                            Well, I think some mechanics are aimed at making certain skills unnecessary or easier to obtain, especially on the part of the GM.<br/>
<br/>
e.g., in a lot of older games, the GM has to basically mind-read to make sure they're hitting the players' interests. And know the players really well. Whereas in, say, TSOY, if someone picks the Key of Unrequited Love, it's pretty damn clear what they're looking for.<br/>
<br/>
Also, a lot of games are making stakes-setting explicit and clear, and that's a technique that can be brought in to almost any game and will improve it.<br/>
<br/>
That said, there are still personal skills being addressed. But I don't think it's either/or.                        </div>

                            As for why mechanics vs skills getting the attention: I think others have pointed at this but not said it explicity -- How many folks in on all these high faluting "make games better" threads are either doing it as game designers, or have only been able to talk about it with designers that they've taken on a designer headspace? <br/><br/>Because there is a large difference in approach between what I do when I go about designing a better game, what I do when I go about making a game I am in better, and what I do when I want to make myself a better player or GM. <br/><br/>Due to the nature of our community, about 50% of our discourse gets focused around the first and about 45% around the second. Which leaves damn little for the third. (And leads to things like "you need to play Dogs, it will change the way you think about game!" as an answer to every question. What if I don't want to change the way I think about game, and just want to be able to better convey emotion in my acting at the table?) <br/><br/>Ironic, because trad game design/GM advice is about 95% the third -- often in ways that conflicted with the first two.                        </div>

<blockquote>I've got lots of guidelines and suggestions on what to include and how to include it in narration in Full Light, Full Steam. I've been pretty conflicted about it throughout the book's development, though, because so much of it seems so obvious, and I cringe at making people spend money to buy text that tells them to, say, use all five senses when describing stuff.<br/><br/>In the end, I gave it a hard edit so it's not too long to really bother me, and decided to go with an old teaching axiom which states that no information you present will be utterly new to everyone in the classroom; but everything will be new to at least someone.</blockquote>
This is why I believe very strongly in the original paradigm of Basic Set, Expert Set that boxed D&amp;D came in.  One 64-page book that gives you the basics, and gives you a limited palette to paint with - crawling around dungeons.  When you grok that, you get the Expert Set.  Now you're introduced to wilderness adventures, but there's still things like planar travel and the like that are reserved for later.  (Certainly, it got a bit goofy towards the top end of the spectrum.)<br/><br/>And you know, despite all the years of backing and filling, there are still people who either a) are coming to your book a relative novice, or b) are crappy GMs.  <br/><br/>System can help, but I think that some serious work on the group-dynamics end of the spectrum would do wonders - I think that a capsystem like Fanmail for D&amp;D would do wonders for encouraging play.                        </div>

                            One of the things that strikes me about this topic is how everyone believes that the <i>West Wing</i> is impossible to replicate in an RPG, because the rapid-fire pace of the dialog and the multiple narrative threads are too hard to replicate.<br/><br/>What I wonder is: Can't we teach that?  Isn't there a way to <i>make</i> people good at that sort of play, especially if they're motivated?                        </div>

                            Buh.<br/><br/>Um ...<br/><br/>Not really.  I watch incredibly little TV, actually.  But I'm re-watching the third season, and here's a sampling from just three typical episodes:<br/><br/>Episode 3/06<br/>The President (Martin Sheen) asks the reluctant Vice President (Tim Matheson) to speak at an anti-gun rally in Texas after a church shooting but the uneasy allies have a starkly candid showdown while Donna (Janel Moloney) goes before a Congressional committee investigating Bartlet's lack of disclosure -- and she lies to her inquisitor (Mark Feuerstein). Elsewhere, Leo (John Spencer) debates an old friend and Air Force officer (Gerald McRaney) about the United States' future stance regarding the War Crimes Tribunal; C.J. (Allison Janney) informs Toby (Richard Schiff) that a reporter (Michael O'Keefe) heard his comment that puts the President in an unfavorable light; and Sam (Rob Lowe) tries to find common sense when a Congressman (Bob Glouberman) proposes legislation that would eliminate the penny.<br/><br/>Episode 3/07<br/>When an American spy submarine suddenly goes silent in hostile North Korean waters, an angry President (Martin Sheen) receives advice from the Assistant Secretary of State (Hal Holbrook) and must decide whether he should notify the enemy or attempt a risky, secret rescue -- while his wife, Abigail (Stockard Channing), learns that her past malpractice suits might be Bartlet's Achilles heel in his criminal investigation. In other White House action, C.J. (Allison Janney) is ecstatic over a potential presidential candidate's indecisive public remarks; Toby (Richard Schiff) meets with a representative from an appropriations committee who wants to funnel money away from Congress' controversial funding of avant-garde artists.<br/><br/>Episode 3/08<br/>While President Bartlet (Martin Sheen) frets about where to spend Thanksgiving -- and how to best cook a gourmet turkey -- C.J. (Allison Janney) powwows with two Native Americans (Gary Farmer and Georgina Lightning) who are camped in the lobby and promise to cause a media dustup if they can't meet with a senior staff member about receiving better public health projects on their reservation. Elsewhere, Josh (Bradley Whitford) pulls some political levers as he tries to gain the extradition of a teenaged boy who murdered his teacher and fled to Italy; Toby (Richard Schiff) informs Bartlet of an inexpensive way to improve his polling numbers; and Sam (Rob Lowe) questions a new poverty income index that could spell trouble for the President by classifying millions more people as poor virtually overnight.<br/><br/>So what you have in each episode is each character dealing with their own problem for the episode - sometimes these things come together and sometimes they don't.  Then you have the overarching story of the season, which is the Congressional hearings on Bartlet's not revealing that he had multiple sclerosis before taking office, and mutliple side-threads, like one of the characters (C.J., who does McClennan's job - spokesperson) having a real problem with the treatment of women in Qumar, a made-up fundamentalist Islamic country.  This carries through multiple epsiodes, but not sequentially.  Then there are overarching (but not contiguous) arcs - again, Qumar is a good example that's key in the third season - where entire episodes will be based on the issue at hand, and everyone is working a different angle on it.<br/><br/>During the course of the episode, each character will deal with their own problem by bouncing ideas off the other characters, getting input or orders, performing tasks, if you will - and it's done at a breakneck pace, usually by literally moving the character around in the West Wing of the White House - Toby passes Josh and they talk about Toby's problem, then Josh will throw in a comment about his own issues; Toby then goes into the Roosevelt room and confronts some party wonks in an extended scene, sometimes (usually) ducking out to give a piece of advice or an order to someone else.  <br/><br/>You really have to watch the show to get a handle on it - it's breathtaking and chaotic, but it's also like an informational ballet.  Usually things don't get wrapped up in one episode - consequences from one episode come back in another three or four away.  <i>West Wing</i> is the only show that I know of that has a 'previously on the West Wing' thingy in front of EVERY episode.<br/><br/>Just writing these paragraphs has given me all sorts of ideas.<br/><br/>But anyways - the normal charge against a West Wing RPG is that 1) the players would have to know as much as the characters do about government, procedure, the Constitution and whatnot - (that's one that's quite true); 2) the breakneck (well written) dialog is one of the main features of the show, and there's no mechanical way of duplicating that skill; 3) the multiple narrative threads are almost impossible to keep track of.                        </div>

                            I think <i>Deadwood</i> is another show like this -- fast-moving dialogue and intercutting between characters engaging their disparate personal problems.<br/><br/>Fred's on to something with his first solution--if the players are active in setting up the game's initial structure they <i>will know</i> the things they need to in order to carry play like these shows. Hell, in many games they could be making up the procedures, etc. as they go along, thereby enriching the setting as a result.<br/><br/>The dialogue issue can be helped by borrowing from the Dying Earth RPG--give each player a couple of prepared lines of dialogue they should try to use during a session and reward them for doing so in a manner that is appropriate and dramatic (as opposed to dropping it in where it doesn't belong). A bit artificial, yes, but still allowing creativity and giving players inspiration for coming up with further cool dialogue.                        </div>

                            Sure, you could set it up with a fictional government, but it wouldn't have the same impact.  Part of the reason why West Wing is so engaging is that they're talking about a fictionalized version of <em>your</em> government.  I don't know of many Canadians who really dig on the show, you know what I mean?                        </div>

                            Josh, <br/><br/>It's mildly popular in Canada for a simple reason: we live just north of you. When America does good things, Canada gets the reactions. When America does crazy things, Canada gets the reaction. <br/><br/>So watching a show about the alien government whose crazy whims can send your dollar through the roof or into the basement? Yea, it has some appeal.                        </div>

                            It doesn't necessarily have to be a fictional government you're using, just fictional procedures, laws, etc. that the players agree to use and make up on the fly. I don't actually know if the stuff the show references is the real deal. As long as it sounds plausible that's good enough to keep the story moving. <br/><br/>Think of Dogs--Vincent didn't include the text of the Book of Life in the game. Yet it's getting quoted in games all the time. As long as the quotation sounds about right and is appropriate to the story, the game is good because of it. Same goes with a <i>West Wing</i> game.                        </div>

                            I think for a good West Wing or Law and Order game you'd need more than the ability to just make it up. That works for Dogs because we all know Dogs is fiction, but if you're going for the illusion of reality you need a little more. Not that you couldn't have a pretty cool game like that, but I do not think it would hit the same buttons as L&amp;O or West Wing. (Plus, no one I know actually cares about the Book of Life beyond just a way to generate plot/raises/sees. People may actually care about the law or the government.) <br/><br/>Of course, I know several lawyers who crack up regularly while watching L&amp;O, so the point that absolute accuracy isn't required is a good one. Hell, at this point it may be possible to go through enough seasons of L&amp;O, The Shield, NYPD Blue and so on and make a crime-investigation genre manual in which it explains the law and cops in the way they're used in drama rather than the way the laws actually work. <br/><br/>Thing is, this gets back to one of the issues in game design that's always bugged me with my esoteric tastes: how much actual work do you want people to have to do in order to play your game?                        </div>

People LIKE working for their games.  Some people LIKE finding out, for example, how agriculture was done in Ancient Greece, to lend versimilitude to their "Hellas that Never Was" setting.                        </div>

                            Vaxalon, <br/><br/>Good answer. And so how do you design for that? <br/><br/>As an example, say I was going to actually publish <a href="http://randomencounters.blogspot.com/2005/06/age-of-kali.html" rel="nofollow">The Age of Kali</a>. How much detail would you suggest I put in? How much "if you want to know about this, go find out in these books, and if you don't care then good?" Especially in a game that gets into areas (Hinduism, Transhumanism) that large segments of my audience might not have a freaking clue about? <br/><br/>Ditto <a href="http://randomencounters.blogspot.com/2005/06/strike.html" rel="nofollow">Strike!</a>. At that point how much do I need to inform the reader about union politics and the history of labour relations? Especially if, without at least some knowledge of them, the game won't have any punch at all? <br/><br/>The games I'm designing these days are mostly settingless or setting light in most ways, as anyone can get into the drama of a normal human being in a modern city having their life turned inside out under the public eye... but a mystical Sufi priest may be a bit more of a stretch for people to feel comfortable with.                        </div>

                            I have the same issue with Grey Ranks - if you don't even know what country Warsaw is in, the nuances of teenage love amid the politically-charged rebellion against nazi occupation is going to be tough.
