So the Mortal's character sheet says "You always have exactly one Lover." Does that mean that the player should have immediately chosen a new Lover? Or should we have gone on, as we did, regarding the Mortal's memory of the Vampire as their lover. This became even more complicated since our Mortal became their darkest self in the process of escaping the combat that killed the Vampire. With a dead Lover, the escape clause for the Mortal's Darkest Self becomes problematic.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403579">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403579/#Comment_403579" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-12T20:18:29+00:00" title="January 12, 2013  8:18PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, time to find a new love.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403582/#Comment_403582" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-12T22:45:53+00:00" title="January 12, 2013 10:45PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's a really cool idea to have the Mortal be in love with the memory of the Vampire - and for as long as that's tenable to your shared story, yeah, do it! But if you hit a snag like that, maybe it's time for him or her (or whatever) to find a new lover. Yeah, even while they're their Darkest Self! You can pick a new lover at any time you like, just give 'em a String. <br/><br/>Alternately, if there were some way that the Mortal could be _reminded_ of the pain that their current actions _would_have_ caused the Vampire, that could work for an escape clause - for example, perhaps the Mortal causes a rift between two of they &amp; the Vampire's dear friends, and then goes to the place that the four of them used to hang out. <br/><br/>...but it's a bit of a stretch, for sure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403585/#Comment_403585" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-12T23:24:37+00:00" title="January 12, 2013 11:24PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The short answer is: whatever makes sense for the story.<br/><br/>The long answer is: having the Mortal hold the vampire's memory as their <i>lover</i> is an interesting and certainly valid way to handle the situation in the short term. If I were MC, I'd probably state explicitly, "Hey Mortal, look for opportunities to rebound to a new lover as soon as possible." And then I'd think about the most two-faced NPCs I'd introduced yet, and have them start showing up as appropriate. I think that if the Mortal player were like, "You know, I'm just going to hold onto the memory of this vampire who's gone now, and keep him as my lover indefinitely," that's also totally fine. That's the entire plot of <b>Twilight: New Moon</b>. Really. If the Mortal's Darkest Self triggered, Jackson's two suggested options are both good: either they need to find a new lover before they can escape (tricky since they're in a bad place!) or they need to do some *intense* navel gazing. Either's awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/exploding_brain" title="exploding_brain"><img alt="exploding_brain" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/exploding_brain">exploding_brain</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403849/#Comment_403849" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-16T20:25:59+00:00" title="January 16, 2013  8:25PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks very much for the feedback.
