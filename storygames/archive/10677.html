People are upset or vocal about my criticisms. Some of what I have to say is counter to traditions of the indie RPG scene. They are challenging things. Some are my opinions which others don't agree with. So, bad communication, especially here online, isn't suprising to any of us. I ask you to read more charitably. I'll try to understand your concerns better in return.<br/><br/>Essentially, what I'm proposing is a new business model. I'm not saying the current scene has to adopt it, or even pay much attention to it. I truly, genuinely hold no ill will to anyone, anyone's game, anyone's goals as an indie publisher. Parts of the business-model-thingy I'm exploring here will challenge assumptions this community has about design and designer ownership, however. It's not meant as an assault. At my best guess, my intentions are to branch off from the current model in a new direction, and let the current model continue onward and upward.<br/><br/>First, I'm going talk about the evolution of my thinking to date, how and why I "got here." Then, I'm going to talk about some ideas I have to try something new in light of the conclusions I draw about creator-owned publishing. <br/><br/><b>Indie RPGs to date</b><br/><br/>I <i>do not</i> define "indie RPGs" not as a style of game design. I define it as a publishing model. Specifically, I define it as creator owned publishing. <br/><br/>That is, the person (or people) who create the game own their intellectual property and make key decisions about publishing their game, including pricing, printing, distribution, and so on.<br/><br/>Another key defining attribute is that each publisher sets his or her own terms for success. This allows for a vareity games, formats, models, etc. This is great. To date, creator owned RPG publishing achieved fantastic things. This includes: \n<ul><li>winning awards</li>\n<li>pioneering publishing techniques</li>\n<li>inventing new distribution models</li>\n<li>trailblazing new marketing techniques</li>\n<li>creating a fun new subculture/audience within the hobby</li>\n<li>redefining and dismantling assumptings about creators and players</li></ul>\nI'm very happy to be a part of this activity since about 2001 or so.<br/><br/><b>Hitting the wall</b><br/><br/>Last year, I ceased publishing my indie RPGs. The primary reason was that my games' sales levels did not meet my own self-defined levels of success. I faced a choice. Either I devoted a huge amount of time and resources to significantly boost sales of my games (approximately double over a couple years), or I would stop. I found the current level of sales and effort unacceptable for my goals as a publisher.  Once I determined that, yes in fact, the level of work required to achieve my goal was probably unworkable for my lifestyle (full time job, wife &amp; two kids, graduate school), I chose to cease publishing.<br/><br/>Since then, I've spent a lot of time thinking about this particular barrier. I spoke with friends and fellow publishers. I gathered up bits and pieces of sales information that others were willing to share.<br/><br/>I realized that there was a specific flaw in the creator owned model that I wanted to investigate. The flaw goes like this: <br/><br/>Creator-owned publishing, by definition, means that a publisher sets his or her own goals. However, to date, it means that setting certain reasonable goals is extremely difficult, maybe even impossible.<br/><br/>The reasonable goal I wish to see accomplished, or accomplish myself, is 1,000 games sold in a year. Think of it as a kind of goal to challenge, a call to raise the bar of publishing activity. If not for others, than at least for me.<br/><br/>I base this 1,000 games number on those publisher conversations and that gathered-up data. Several games have sold over 1,000 over longer than 1 year. Very few have sold 1,000 in 1 year (or, 2,000 in 2 years). Gregor Hutton appears to have accomplished this with 3:16, for example. (And, by they way, that rocks!) <br/><br/>I think the 1,000 is <i>arguable</i>, but I chose that number. Is 1,000 unreasonable, but something more like 600 or 750 sales reasonable? Maybe so. That'd be ok. The number I consider "average" for a "good" game is about 300 (Grey Ranks, for example, is at 300 over a couple years). I'd like to see "good" games routinely double that number, and exceptional games at least triple it. I'm obviously not <i>expecting</i> all indie games to do that. I just would love to see such growth happen.<br/><br/>CONT'D BELOW                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236816/#Comment_236816" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-10T16:55:58+00:00" title="October 10, 2009  4:55PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 10, 2009 5:01PM by Matt Snyder.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Why not now?</b><br/><br/>Ok, so I identified and explained some concrete numbers about what goals I'd like to see realized, either with games I publish or even with games peers succeed with.<br/><br/>But it didn't really answer an important question I had about this flaw I'd observed. Why is selling 500+ games a major accomplishment? Why can't more games achieve at least that number more routinely? What causing this fuzzy limit and prevent people from regularly selling around 1,000 games if they give it a decent shot?<br/><br/>And, from all the things I've gathered and the many conversations I've had, I conclude two things: <br/><br/>1) Broadly speaking, indie RPG publishers have insufficient marketing or resources to reach that 1,000 games sold. All conduct some level of marketing to varying effect. Extremely few (fewer than 5) successful reach that number.<br/><br/>AND/OR<br/><br/>2) Broadly speaking, most indie RPG publishers design games that not much more than, say, about 500 people want or demand. Let me qualify that some: Not more than about 500 <i>accessible</i> people want or demand.<br/><br/>Now, at this point, the jury's out. Am I off my rocker concluding points <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> &amp; <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> above? I suspect some will find my conclusions here wrong. That's ok. I've been wrong before, I'll be wrong again. But, this is where I'm at currently. I stand by the above, but this isn't to say I won't hear other ideas about it.<br/><br/><b>The implications of marketing and market</b><br/><br/>If my conclusions above are close to right, here's what I think the implications are: <br/><br/>If <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> is close to correct, then in theory I could do better marketing or acquire more marketing resources and reach 1,000 sales. This is no small feat. In fact, it's huge. But, plausible.<br/><br/>If <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> is roughly correct, then I could be well and truly fucked. I have three options in this case:\n<ol><li>Stop publishing now, and save myself some time and effort.</li>\n<li>Proceed with games, work hard, and not succeed on my terms (i.e. not sell 1,000 games).</li>\n<li>Design games differently for a different market (i.e. different than the current indie RPG market).</li></ol>\n<b>How to proceed?</b><br/><br/>I reached these conclusions and implications pretty recently -- about the last month or two. I talked these over with a few pals. (By the way, because this is pretty new thinking for me, that's a big reason I'm seeing concerns from peers that I'm not being very clear. I'm still thinking through this stuff. Please consider that.)<br/><br/>First, <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> from above: The implication is that with superior marketing, my goals might be achievable.<br/><br/>But, that puts me right where I ended last year! Nothing's changed. To to "superior marketing," I'll need more time or resources. Damn. That requires a very creative solution. Or, it means I stay out of publishing.<br/><br/>Second, <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> from above: I have to make a decision. Assuming for the moment the decision is <i>not</i> "stop now," what's required? Well. differently designed games for a different market. Again, a creative solution's required. This one's fun to do, but also hard. It also requires resources, especially time.<br/><br/>CONT'D BELOW                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236817/#Comment_236817" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-10T16:56:43+00:00" title="October 10, 2009  4:56PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Creative solutions</b><br/><br/>There must be dozens of ways to confront these issues. I don't claim these are the only or even the best. Hell, I don't even have a firm notion of what they are just yet, in practice.<br/><br/><b>solving #1: A cooperative</b><br/>First, I have a problem. I can't do this alone. My proposed solution is to create a co-operative imprint. A unified label that "publishes" the members' games, which is actually to say it <i>markets</i> the members' games. <br/><br/>In essence, the members would organize and share duties in a mutually beneficial arrangement. The equation results in increased resources across the board for each member. One example: Rather than each publisher setting up a website, a blog, etc., the co-op would set up one web presence with a shared platform and cross linking among members. We'd bring search traffic and eyeballs to one place instead of 6 places (or whatever number of members).<br/><br/><b>solving #2: Games FOR demand</b><br/>Next, designing different games for a different market requires a few things. \n<ul><li>First, the cooperative would need to identify and target the market. I've got one in mind. It basically boils down to active, but not especially hard core, gamers, and not the current recognizable "indie RPG" market.</li>\n<li>Second, we'd need to identify games that will meet this market's demands. Again, I've got a couple ideas for that. I'm sure others would, too.</li>\n<li>Third, and most controversially, the games are vetted in some way. <br/>There is some kind of approval process, editing or filter that assesses a game design, and decides yay or nay whether it should be published and marketed.<br/></li></ul>\nThis last one could be a fucking nightmare! I also believe it's vital for the success of this concept. Without it, I believe we'd be right back where we started as individuals in terms of sales levels for various members' games (i.e. it's kind of a crapshoot who has 1,000+ while everyone else has 300 or so sales).<br/><br/>I don't know who would be willing to participate in such a set up. Maybe no one. I'm interested seeking some people out, though.<br/><br/>Think of it as a VERY ROUGH comparison to becoming the Dark Horse or Image of RPGs. Neat.<br/><br/><b>Goodbye indies?</b><br/>The model I've sketched out here move closer and closer to traditional publisher. I'm basically suggesting a development &amp; marketing team, new games with business plans, and a new market of "old" gamers. Well, hell, that's damn near a traditional RPG publisher.<br/><br/>I think the key difference is co-operative ownership. Each member either owns his own material OR the group collectively owns all games in a kind of shared IP set up.<br/><br/><b>Working for the man</b><br/>I have a similar notion of setting up a non-co-operative set up. A couple owners (me and pals, say) own the imprint, and we bring on board publishers to become their marketing face forward. I don't think this is very workable short term. I don't have the resources to do it, by which I basically mean the money. <br/><br/><b>Done!</b><br/>Ok! That's where I'm at today. There's a lot of stuff here, written and rewritten. It took me several hours to compose this. I suspect there will be criticisms, questions, and more comments. I hope to keep up with those. If recent threads are an indication, it will be TOUGH to keep up with folks' questions and replies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236820/#Comment_236820" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-10T17:31:11+00:00" title="October 10, 2009  5:31PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some questions and points:<br/><br/>1. You talk about "1,000 sales" and "1,000 sales a year", and switch between the two. The goal is 1k games a year, and most games don't seem to even reach 1k period, at least within 3 or so years from publication. It's even more "dire".<br/><br/>2. The points in the second post. If the problem is "Accessible" people in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, then perhaps it just feeds back to point #1: What you need is more marketing, or marketing aimed at a different group, to turn these people into "Accessible buyers". Thus, I'm not sure I'm seeing how <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> is different, unless it means that unlike <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, these people would buy the game if they'd even <i>hear</i> of it and due to not enough marketing, they don't, and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> means a different approach, qualitatively, not just quantative?<br/><br/>3. I am not sold on why from <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> point you'd need "Different games for a different crowd", as I pointed out above, you may need "Different marketing for different crowds, of the same game." You may be alluding to the "Need to teach how to frame scenes, what a GM does, etc." but I guess I belong to the "Critical crowd" which thinks all these things should be in games released at "our crowd" as it is. So it's not really a difference in how things should progress, but where here it might be work-able, it won't be for a brand new crowd.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Darcy%20Burgess" title="Darcy Burgess"><img alt="Darcy Burgess" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://home.ca.inter.net/~krunch/PBP/gc07/pics/icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Darcy%20Burgess">Darcy Burgess</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236822/#Comment_236822" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-10T17:55:13+00:00" title="October 10, 2009  5:55PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 10, 2009 5:57PM by Darcy Burgess.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Snyder</cite><b>Creative solutions</b><br/><b>Working for the man</b><br/>I have a similar notion of setting up a non-co-operative set up.

I'm not sure what big community norms you're challenging here, really, because some of this has been tried or is being tried right now.<br><br>For example, what would your new group do that Evil Hat doesn't already do for the folks who co-publish games through them? Right now I think that's Fred, Rob, Leonard, Chad, Paul, and, eventually, Daniel and maybe Ryan.  Evil Hat, for the most part, markets to a mainstream roleplaying crowd, not one that self-identifies as part of the indie scene, which is an interesting thing considering their close ties to IPR.  And they've been pretty successful at that, I think, partially because Fred/Rob and Chad had extensive non-Forge-ish followings before they began partnering with folks more firmly a part of that community, so you regularly see SOTC and S7S more commonly mentioned in mainstream circles than a lot of independent games.  And a previous attempt at something like this was done with Wicked Dead Brewing Company, yeah? Though that was on a somewhat smaller scale than it sounds like you're talking about here.  And, also, not to forget what Collective Endeavor in the UK was up to before Malcolm went off to grad school in New Zealand.  That was a pretty similar set up with at least a half-dozen British designers co-publishing under the same brand.<br><br>If this kind of arrangement would get you excited about designing and publishing games again, I totally think you should do it.  Honestly, I'd love to be part of some collective like that too, but I'm not sure our publishing goals are compatible enough to make a partnership between us feasible.  But I keep hoping on bumping into enough people who share similar design/publishing goals that a collective like that could work.  John's right that these kinds of groupings may eventually arise naturally out of convention booths, though some booths seem very loosely tied together by things other than marketing/publishing goals, so there would probably have to be some more in-depth discussions that would have to happen before deeper arrangements were undertaken.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko" title="Seth Drebitko"><img alt="Seth Drebitko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w135/sethbashwinger/fetusgoplayavatar-2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko">Seth Drebitko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236837/#Comment_236837" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-10T20:48:03+00:00" title="October 10, 2009  8:48PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 10, 2009 8:50PM by Seth Drebitko.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have to agree with all points provided. I think a major issue is in part two things:<br>\n<br>\n1. Low barrier of entry. Any one can make an "indie" game blow good money on a cover and sell it. This is why I don't buy things from lulu, or rpgnow you can't tell any more what will or wont be good.<br>\n2. We have a very flavor of the week style style "industry". From personal observation trends are very short lived due to the nature of the one shot product model.<br>\n<br>\nThat said I would see a co-op style of publishing as a worthwhile experiment though it would be important to have some common bond between the games. As an example it could be decided that the designers could all publish what ever type games they chose so long as they were based on the same setting. Another valid option would be the group creation of a unified core system say a bit thicker than fudge, with a little less locked in rules like the d20 system. My personal thoughts would be:<br>\n<br>\n1.

I have no experience publishing games, but I have published indie software before.<br><br><i>"Last year, I ceased publishing my indie RPGs. The primary reason was that my games' sales levels did not meet my own self-defined levels of success. I faced a choice. Either I devoted a huge amount of time and resources to significantly boost sales of my games (approximately double over a couple years), or I would stop. I found the current level of sales and effort unacceptable for my goals as a publisher."</i><br><br>Aren't there other options between Get Bigger and Stop Publishing? Like, Stay At The Same Level? Why is 1,000 copies a year success and 300 a year failure? Having a few hundred people a year validate your creation by paying money for it, and bringing them some enjoyment and appreciation of your talents, sounds like a good deal. (Since, as you say, you're not depending on this for your livelihood.)<br><br>I'm guessing that the answer is that it takes a nontrivial amount of work to continue selling bundles of dead-tree, such as getting them printed and taking orders and putting them in the mail. But there are places that will do that for you nowadays; in the extreme you can either go all-PDF and let IPR or DriveThruRPG do all the work, or use a print-on-demand service like Lulu. That pretty much reduces your workload to zero while still allowing your creations to reach an audience.<br><br>The alternative you propose, of a publishing cooperative, seems pretty mainstream. It's already being used, a lot, in related areas like music (heard of indie record labels?) I mean, it's a fine idea, but I don't see what about it is new or controversial.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_236847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236847/#Comment_236847" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-10T23:00:37+00:00" title="October 10, 2009 11:00PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 10, 2009 11:02PM by TomasHVM.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find this interesting. Thanks for sharing, Matt.<br><br>I do understand your frustration; to make things for the public is hard when said public don't get it (like in; don't understand the qualities and/or don't ever get the chance to buy it). To have people play our games is second nature to designing them. To have <b>thousands</b> play our games is positive in regard to our creative future, to our self-esteem, and to our economy. So we need to sell our games to more gamers, whether by reaching more of them, or by creating new gamers out there ...<br><br>Your model for doing this seems to be a brave shot at solving the conundrum you are facing. To make the model work, you need a group of dedicated game-designers, 3-5 designers, who are willing to commit to this model and it's goals for, lets say, at least 5 years. They must commit to being part of each-others creative work (playtesting and sifting), and have to climb the "marketing barricades" for whatever game are brought to the forefront of your bussiness, possibly one, two or three games in a single year.<br><br>It should be feasible.

We have a pretty clear division of labor, with one person doing the marketing, a collaborative web presence, throwing out game ideas we don't see as being marketable (or reduce them in scope to a cheap PDF), and put one person in charge of marketing, one person in charge of numbers, etc. We're also pretty clear about trading our skills with each other (editing, layout, design, illustration) when necessary. We each have our own sub-branding (Summerbird, Dissolute Games) that exists under the umbrella publishing entity. Each of those sub-brands actually has their own goals for what their games are like: summerbird is hyper-aesthetic, fantastical escapism, and Dissolute Games is harder-hitting psychological sim. Stuff that doesn't fit in either tends to be published just under the 2SP logo alone. (And I say "our own sub-brands," but I'm actually going to be publishing a quick little PDF under the summerbird brand fairly soon, because that's where it fits in the library.)<br><br>Of course, we're just two people. We've thought for a while that it'd be cool to invite people in, or to subsume 2SP into something bigger, but we haven't been sure about how to approach people. Our game partnership pre-dates our romantic relationship by quite some time, but I'm sure we look pretty insular from the outside.

A test worth a damn might cost a hundred bucks a month, maybe. Even this would be very modest, and would have to be monitored.<br/><br/>One purchase might be software services to send email newsletters (this might be doable for free, which would be great).<br/><br/>A budget for advertising placements and sponsorships. These would be limited and targeted -- RPG.net placements, for example. Or, maybe fan sites of relevant genres, possibly. It would also be in sponsoring/getting placement in regional conventions booklets.<br/><br/>A budget for promotions, including contests to attract new people to become aware of the site/products.<br/><br/>An allocation for GenCon. This one's damned expensive. In fact, it's so expensive, I'd entertain not attending and instead relying on presence via vendors.<br/><br/>An expectation that a chunk of product will be given freely (and mailed) to reviewers, key motivators, Ennies judges, etc. This isn't as expensive, but it ain't free either.<br/><br/>A modest level of research, likely an online survey for key findings, product design, and target market activity. This would probabaly be fairly inexpensive (around $25, likely).<br/><br/>____________________<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/John">@John</a><br/><br/>I agree the structure would definitely require an "exit clause."

I'm saying that's not really true, and that I don't accept it anymore. <br/><br/><br/>2) That, at least for my purposes, I don't recognize more than possibly a very small handful of games that would "qualify." There are dozens of fine games, just not for what I have in mind is all. <br/><br/>3) The basic overall premise -- that number of sales is paramount for success. As opposed to other values, like innovation, actual play, aesthetic, etc.<br/><br/>Taken together, these things seem even to me like a condemnation of what's gone on to date, though that's not my intention.<br/><br/>______________________<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Seth">@Seth</a> D.<br/><br/>Interesting post!

Matt is talking about a model that works really well, just no-one in this "industry" actually does it (with the exception, I think of Evil Hat). I don't think it's very productive talking about how "controversial" it all is. I think it is productive to explore/critique implementation and related models.<br/><br/>Like, what actually would need to happen to do this?<br/><br/>*Someone (or someone's, but I doubt more than two peeps) need to be in charge. <br/>**He/she/they need to formulate a mission statement and establish what criteria they will use to vet products and/or recruit publishers. <br/>**Also, a business model needs to be created and nailed down that gives goals and methods for gaining back whatever initial investment there is in the venture (say, over 3 years, thats pretty reasonable right?), as well as making it worth each individual publishers involvement - and, something that does preserve IP and creator ownership (cuz that's kinda the point).<br/><br/>*Once this is set, they need to either recruit publishers whose work fits in with their mission statement, or maybe open for submissions of new work. Either way, some kind of client base needs to be established.<br/><br/>*A killer website needs to be paid for, created, and maintained.<br/><br/>*Advertising venues need to be identified and someone needs to start creating advertising.<br/><br/>*A social media/word-of-mouth/viral strategy needs to be identified, and someone needs to spearhead that.<br/><br/>*What's the sales model? Does this label handle stock? Does it coordinate fulfillment (Vincent Baker has a utility for coordinating fulfillment to one or two shipping people over at Independently Fulfilling, tho I can't find the link, and the the <a href="http://games.indie-rpgs.com/" rel="nofollow">Un-Store</a> is a collective shopping thing).<br/><br/>*A convention attendance strategy needs to be created and budgeted for.<br/><br/>So that's, like, minimum to get off the ground. Pretty daunting when most of us already (a) spend most of our free time, y'know, writing and publishing games and (b) don't have the time/money to invest in that activity to our satisfaction. I remember talking to Brennan in the first couple years I was with IPR, and he was constantly saying "Man, I don't have time to write games any more". <br/><br/>So I think the BIGGEST hurdle is that the folks in charge need to make a conscious decision to focus on this thing INSTEAD of their other hobby activities for at least the first year, if not more. Which, in this community, is a pretty big deal.<br/><br/>(edit: x-posted w/Matt, I think it still stands tho)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236867/#Comment_236867" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-11T09:22:50+00:00" title="October 11, 2009  9:22AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, Matt.  It sounds like you're basically describing an indie collective similar to what's gone on before, but one that operates much more like a small, professional game company (Green Ronin, say, aside from focusing on work-for-hire) rather than a gaggle of independent designers with some shared interests.  That seems totally reasonable as a next step for some designers to take, as long as someone can play point and get that started.  <br/><br/>Interestingly, I would personally be much more likely to get involved in such a group in a non-designer role, for example as a layout artist or editor or customer relations or marketer or web designer, because those are the skills I'm more comfortable using in a commercial fashion (and I like game design to stay closer to a hobby, just for me personally).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236869/#Comment_236869" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-11T09:32:55+00:00" title="October 11, 2009  9:32AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nathan, your post absolutely stands.

The equation results in increased resources across the board for each member.

We'd bring search traffic and eyeballs to one place instead of 6 places (or whatever number of members).</blockquote>\nYou should think about other aspects of marketing, such as how strong you want your co-op's brand identity to be. Would the products all have a unified look and feel? Similar art? Layout? Writing? Similar theme, mechanics, setting?

Seems like you'd want to have an overall creative vision to make this work.  Right now, there's no reason that I'd like all of Evil Hat's products just because I like one of them, which is their big weakness, I think, as far as marketing goes, though their range of games could also be seen as a strength.  In comparison, the Burning Wheel HQ is a super-focused group of folks working on a single game line and a few closely related branches (aside from, say, FreeMarket).  Ideally, I think, you'd want something in the middle, with a unified feel but not necessarily closely related mechanics.  The closest example I can think of is maybe Hogshead's New Style imprint, which was all short, experimental games printed in the same format.<br/><br/>Also, a good way to start a label like this might be to rebrand or even redevelop existing games to form the basis of the new line.  For example, if Matt re-released Nine Worlds and/or Dust Devils Revenged under his new (fictional) "Hard Hitting Entertainment" label, complete with new trade dress and maybe new layout or even format/rules changes, it would create a initial set of products and also create a "feel" for the label as a whole, so potentially interested designers could determine whether this was a label they were interested in publishing under or working with.<br/><br/>I also think having really concrete marketing / sales goals would be important.  Like "get in Barnes &amp; Nobles" or "get into the board game section, next to Eurogames" or "get featured in Anime magazines" or "get reviewed in McSweeney's".  Even if you ended up not quickly achieving such a goal, it would give you a strong sense of who your audience was and what you would have to do to reach that audience.  A concerted push in a specific direction is much more likely to achieve the kinds of sales that Matt is talking about here, rather than the general outward push that indie companies generally do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236885/#Comment_236885" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-11T11:07:46+00:00" title="October 11, 2009 11:07AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt, from what I have understood from my readings, the market for "forge games" increased rather dramatically between 2002-2006, only on the strength of actual play and word-of-mouth<br/><br/>This is NOT happening now. Why? Why having these games played is not reaching new players?<br/><br/>I think I have at least some answers, but I have no idea about how much they counts, between the many possible answers to that question. One of these answers is a very common phenomenon that I have observed in people who buy some "forge games" without any contact with the forums or the blogs... and they play the game horribly wrong, often using rule zero or treating most of the manual as "advices", and they have a very bad, boring experience, and then they go telling everybody in theyr social circles that "these games suck" (it's very common experience, for me, meeting people at convention demos telling me that they already played that game but in a very different manner, in the way I explained before).  What I am saying is that the game texts did not evolve, at least for many, with the velocity game design evolved, and having these games played by "traditional gamers" without better explaining text mean creating a crust of bitter and resentful "new customers" around and a very bad reputation following them. <br/><br/>Wouldn't be better to be sure to have game texts that could be understood by traditional gamers, before trying to reach them? <br/><br/>This does NOT mean giving them traditional games, if they don't represent a change, why play them? There was a good article by Ben Lehman in his old blog, now deleted, about which games sold better and what they had in common, and one of the things common in these successful games what that they represented dramatic changes in gameplay...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236888/#Comment_236888" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-11T11:14:34+00:00" title="October 11, 2009 11:14AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So basically, you want to start a game company?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236890/#Comment_236890" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-11T11:18:54+00:00" title="October 11, 2009 11:18AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 11, 2009 11:20AM by Levi Kornelsen.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt:<br/><br/>I wouldn't want to be a <i>participant</i> in the kind of thing you're describing.

It can only be healthy for the system. I see it both from the publisher and retailer perspective how screwy the 3 tier system can be and how dangerous an over reliance on it (from either side) can be. I am not advocating its destruction or revamping. It is what is it and it serves a useful purpose for many manufacturers and retailers. But it is not the end all be all of the games market. Indie, these days most small press and indie publishers hardly use the 3 tier system.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that does sort of bring us back to your issue with moving a 1000 games a year. In retail, to move quantities of anything, you have to have access to the market. That is achieved in 2 ways (though there can be infinite approaches to get to either) and that is, a whole lot of retail points of distribution (ala, on the shelf available for purchase in many locations) or available online with an aggressive and well established marketing system to bring folks to the site to purchase.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 3 tier system does not have the funding or capacity to intelligently distribute the vastness of games that are available. So they've engineered systems to allow them a fair chance at good service for top tier products, a modest chance at ok service at mid tier stuff and a small chance at catching some of the dollors from the more popular small press and indie stuff. Any company so designated in that lowest tier might partake in the use of the 3 tier system, but it is by design going to be too eradic and unstable to be forged into a reliable distribution system that you could hope to build a company upon. A tool perhaps for use, but not at the core of the business.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut lacking effective distribution through the 3 tier system, most independent companies fail to achieve getting broad access of their product to the public. This is the principle reason for failure to achieve strong and steady sales.<br/>\n<br/>\nWide access to the public can also be achieved online, but its not easy that way either. Through a whole lot of work, someone aggressively marketing and promoting a game can get it a fair bit of attention and achieve some modest sales and occasionally hit the right chord and get some strong sales. But all too often, these sales only stay strong for the duration the designer/publisher are agressively promoting the item. That is because that sales approach is push marketing. Sales only happen when the product is being pushed. In general it is less about brand power, networking and distribution points and more about salesmenship and word of mouth. It fails when attention slips from pushing that particular item to pushing some other particular item, or if insufficient time is available to keep the push going strong. Most small companies don't have large budgets to drive brand power and awareness and most often slip into a push marketing strategy for their online presence. Hence why an indie publisher can come out strong, sell a few hundred and/or upwards to a thousand books in their first year or two, but eventually those sales die off to a great degree once that designer moves onto start push marketing towards their next project (which eventually they get an inkling to tackle) and they may or may not be success in pushing that next product, but they achieve not much of an accumulative affect of having more items in total to sell.<br/>\n<br/>\nBe it offline or online, to build up a strong sales base and to get steady sales beyond what can be achieved from pushing on item, distribution points must be established (offline for the physical goods, online for the distribution of marketing materials and entry points into your store) and a pull marketing infrastructure put into place. By infrastructure, I mean, a system of articles, links, advertising placements, brand building efforts, licensing, resellers, search engine and directory placements, etc, that are existent and always working for you and do not require ongoing active "pushes" to remain in effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo that end, there are lots and lots of ways to achieve that. Yes, a cooperative could be one of them. Lots of indie publishers working together to dual brand their goods. Branding the cooperative as a whole and their games in specific. Much the same way a company might brand itself and its individual brands. You would merely be using the collective power of the cooperative's members individual promotions to brand the cooperative, rather than the traditional more capital intensive approaches that larger companies might use. It can work. If done right. Frankly, if you think about it, its much the same how IPR built up its presence, even if it weren't quite so deliberately conceptualized to work out that way, it is effectively how it did.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat all said, there is no magic in selling 1000 units in a year, much less year after year. I think since 1996 and after a couple hundred publications, we've had maybe 5 of them peak over 1000 sales in their first year. All of those back when we were using the 3 tier system almost exclusively and frankly, it simply worked a whole lot better back then (for smaller publishers anyways).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, 1000 sales sold that way is not necessarily more profitable or better for brand building either. The numbers game goes a lot deeper than raw units sold.<br/>\n<br/>\nExample:<br/>\nLets us our recently released Empires of History: WWII board game as an example. It has a MSRP of $47.95. At a 60% discount selling thrugh distributors it would net $19.18 per unit. If we sold 1000 in a year, with 900 through distribution and 100 through our website and conventions our total gross sales for the item would be $22,057, less cost of goods sold (including free shipping the distributors) of approximately $5500, leaving us a gross profit of $16,557. Now, on the other hand, if we sell just 400 units but all direct, our gross sales would be a bit less at $19,180, but our cost of goods sold would only be about $1800 and mail order sales have the customer pay shipping, so our total gross profit would be $17,380. You see how those 400 games sold turned out more profitable than those 1000 of the same game sold?<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there is the arguement that more games sold is still better because it puts more games into the hands of actual players. Well....1000 games sold into distribution is NOT YET 1000 games into hands of players. You might have up to 50 or more on distribtion shelves and a couple hundred on retailer shelfs. So its more a case of 400 vs 750 in players' hands. Then you have to look at the communication levels you get with the end consumer. They trend much higher with direct sales, where you can get direct contact capabilities and you can market your website, other products, your support forums, etc, etc. I would argue 400 sold direct vs 750 sold 2 channels down river will get you more stable communication with your customer base with the direct sales. Keeping that base informed and excited about the game, add ons, variants and simply other products you might eventually offer can make those 400 a much louder voice than the 750 disconnected buyers.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is not to say I am arguing in favor of direct, web only sales, as the ideal course of action. I think it depends on the game and the company. Just trying to illustrate how raw sales figures are just a surface look at the viability of a product and its prospects for continued profits and success in the future. <br/>\n<br/>\nTotal unit sales does NOT equal profits. TSR sold what, 1.5 million Forgotten Realms campaign box sets back in the day, each at a loss of $1 for a total loss of $1.5 Mil? Extra profitability on a product can be achieved both by expanding distribution and sales, changing distribution methods so they favorably impact your gross margin, or even by changing manufacturering processes to drop the cost of goods sold. GOB Publishing's top selling game in 2008 sold a bit over 700 units. That was about tied for its sales in 2007, which was its strongest unit sales in a year since its first edition printing and initial release back in 1998. The key difference there was in 1998 it was a $20 product almost all sold via wholesale ($8.00 ea) and a higher cost of goods sold vs recently the new edition being a $34.95 product mostly sold direct with a slightly lower cost of goods sold. That makes the game, as currently sold, vastly more profitable and more ably to contribute to supporting our company and its staff. We sell less of it now than in 1998, but its a MUCH more successful product for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan S.

It's called The Night It Died, and it's about the breakdown of a community.<br/><br/>Inspired by some other artistic scenes I'm involved in (zines, poetry chapbooks), I want to make a physical book that sells for $4-5 (with a cost of around $1-2 to me).<br/><br/>Let's say that selling 1000 copies of a 5 dollar book with no weird genre isolationism (like sci-fi and fantasy have)... is quite do-able. My aunts, uncles, grandparents and cousins might all buy copies - after all, it's only $5. Etc.<br/><br/>1000 might net me $3,000-$4,000.<br/>I don't think that's the kind of profit margin you're thinking of.<br/><br/>So, I'm wondering what your/Ryan's/Nathan's/everyone's opinion is... what metrics would a co-op use to measure success, and what levels would those metrics need to achieve? Units sold (as illustrated by Ryan's and my examples) is great for goal-setting but doesn't actually reflect how much profit is being made, how many games are being played, etc.<br/><br/>I'm seeing the following metrics:<br/>units sold (1000 seems like a great number)<br/>net profit ($10,000 seems like a great number)<br/>con presence (having at least one external person running your game at every mid-sized and large con seems like a great number)<br/>Actual Play reporting (seeing AP once a month consistent over two years seems like a great number)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236931">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236931/#Comment_236931" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-11T15:43:56+00:00" title="October 11, 2009  3:43PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 11, 2009 6:59PM by johnzo.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Snyder</cite>First, the cooperative would need to identify and target the market.

Lots of geeks I know love Munchkin not because it's an awesome game (it is not) but because it makes many very funny little jokes in their language.  Both SJG and JC have street teams of fans who evangelize their stuff for free.  They convert their hardcore fans into their sales and support organization so the casual fans always have someone to play with, someone can write their FAQs and websites, etc, etc.<br/><br/>A couple years ago, JC was stuck in Seattle unexpectedly overnight and wanted to play a show but didn't have a stage.  He reached out to his fans, and the network had him hooked up with a nightclub in about thirty minutes.  That's pretty amazing, I think.<br/><br/>Come to think of it, *lots* of D&amp;D books have been sold into the Wednesday night 4E game that I run.  My newbie game on Friday sold at least three PHBs and five Chessex dice sets.   I am effectively a volunteer Wizards sale associate.  Hey Wizards, you should do some kind of affiliate plan for people like me!<br/><br/>b) I do pirate and zombie comics, but only for business reasons--I am not a pirate or zombie fan. I don't hate 'em, but neither spins my crank in a special way.  Not only are those items top sellers for me, but I've had several businesspeople  in 'pirate culture' and 'zombie culture' approach me about bulk purchases of my stuff as promo items for their own businesses.  "Hello, I'd like to pay to be your sales agent please" has a nice ring to it.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Cynically pandering to subcultures like this really runs counter to (what I perceive as) the indie value of Doing Your Own Fucking Thing That You Are Genuinely Passionate About, but I thought I'd mention it, because having a proven moneymaker in your stable can really free you up to experiment with stuff.  My astronaut comic, done in anticipation that astronauts would become Hot, has not panned out saleswise yet, but that didn't hurt too much because of the continued strong zombie and pirate sales.  And on a larger scale, I don't know if GURPS (or even SJG) would exist without Munchkin money.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236958/#Comment_236958" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-11T20:10:28+00:00" title="October 11, 2009  8:10PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 11, 2009 8:11PM by snej.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            joepub mentioned <i>"weird genre isolationism (like sci-fi and fantasy have)"</i>, which relates to something I'd been thinking: that in RPGs it seems to be the other way around. The mainstream products are almost all heavily genre-based, primarily fantasy of course but also SF / superhero / horror / western / pulp-adventure. In that kind of market, a <i>lack</i> of overt genre, as seen in a number of indies, sets a game apart.<br/><br/>It does of course increase the chance that a non-gamer might buy the game; but it basically increases it from zero to a vanishingly small positive number. The non-gamer who doesn't even have a sense of D&amp;D is, won't know what to make of an even more abstracted indie game. It'd be like trying to describe doom metal or drum-n-bass to someone whose musical exposure is limited to boy-bands and the Eagles.<br/><br/>So the real task might be to increase the market beyond gamers, because I certainly don't think that playing D&amp;D or Warhammer or even Final Fantasy needs to be a prerequisite. Maybe people who are into acting and theater would be a natural market? And what about those "host a murder mystery" games -- those get pretty close to RPGs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez" title="Daniel_M_Perez"><img alt="Daniel_M_Perez" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dmperez.com/offline/avatars/danny_avatar_03_32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez">Daniel_M_Perez</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236985/#Comment_236985" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-12T08:46:24+00:00" title="October 12, 2009  8:46AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt, I don't really have anything to add to your post at the moment, but I like very much the direction in which it's heading.

The chief advantage D&amp;D has for new people, and the reason it has historically been able to drag thousands on thousands into the hobby - and whatever else it may lack, Fourth Edition is extremely strong in this area - is concrete choices. There is never a moment where someone is smoking a giant d12-shaped bong and says "do whatever you want, maaaaaan". It's "Here, pick from a list of cool, evocative classes, races, and abilities. Get a name and think about who they are while we start playing." Coming up with a name is the hardest part because it has the fewest boundaries! Writing a trait is far more difficult than distributing some stat points. <br/><br/>That's not to say that many indie games have excellent "concrete choices" that make them easy to grasp. DitV's bidding structure is one. IAWA's Oracle pulls are another.   The best trait in Dogs for new players is your coat because it's cool, evocative and <i>it's a coat</i>. It's not "a piece of clothing" or "a symbolic thing you carry your family made for you" or "a special item important to the Faith". You don't have to decide what it is, it's a coat, you just decide what your coat is like, and "tattered" is enough if that's what you want.<br/><br/>Other things are harder for new people - Beliefs in With Great Power are so wide-open as to be hard to think about. Traits in games with freeform traits are like this. And if I "get narration"? Yikes! Can I give it to someone else?!? Not newb-friendly at all. That's not to say they're not good ideas or good design or that they don't reward the new people who get enthused about it and work at learning it, which are all things that keep someone with a game session after session.

The only thing I see is a shift from success defined as "I managed to reach a few people like me" to actual monetary/publisher/product success.  If that's your success, that's hard to argue.<br/><br/>I have long believed that your <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> has been the case.  I also believe that <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> is true because the bulk of that market has either never been exposed to our hobby or has long since been chased out of the hobby and only die hards like me still exist.  Growing <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> is *my* personal focus and definition of success.  If it's not yours, awesome.  I'm somewhat saddened by that as I consider you one of the more respectable "soldiers" in that fight but if your time and energy is best spent elsewhere then, more power to you.<br/><br/>To be more clear, instead of saying "Well, since only 300 people want Grey Ranks, I shouldn't make Grey Ranks."  I want to say Grey Ranks has value so let's go find the other 600 people who aren't here in the games community.<br/><br/>Jesse<br/><br/>Edited Note: That is to say, I don't want to make something 1000 people will like.  I want to find the 1000 people who like what I like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_237325">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237325/#Comment_237325" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-13T21:59:23+00:00" title="October 13, 2009  9:59PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>The best trait in Dogs for new players is your coat because it's cool, evocative and<i>it's a coat</i>.

I know, especially living in such close proximity to so many great GMs and since I haven't ran a GM-style game in seven years, I find the idea of being GM pretty daunting-- the paralysis of choice. Also, one thing that D&amp;D does well is giving the DM <i>their own game to play.</i> Mapping encounters, choosing and balancing monsters, figuring out what treasure they'd give-- I know a lot of people who love that part of D&amp;D much more than they enjoy being a player. So sitting down to work on the GM section for Blowback, I keep asking myself: how can I make this easier? How can I make it more fun?
