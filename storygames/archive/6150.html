I told Jason about this project of mine about one and a half years ago, and chatted about it with Chris from Endgame when I was there to visit him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am in a tough position regarding this, because I lack artistic talent and lots of experience with board games. Right now the boardgame features a reputation tracker, six large fields depicting the main events, and a place to draw the roach cards from (this is after about an hour building the board).<br/>\n<br/>\nI plan on a second and third stack of cards giving you the recurring and additional cast (a possible deviation from the original game; you draw your peers randomly, possibly being limited by reputation as to how many people you are able to involve in your plots); and there will be nice playing pieces showing if someone is roached or clean.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you think could be on the board/part of the design to facilitate playing the games?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136958/#Comment_136958" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-30T06:20:00+00:00" title="March 30, 2008  6:20AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It'd be neat if the board also served as a sort of play aid, laying out locations on and around campus and likely NPCs that could be called on.

Perhaps there could be one or two NPCs who are linked to each particular scene, and then you could randomly draw the rest.<br><br>It would be nice to have some space on the board for:<br/>-Players to put the tokens that they are betting for conflicts.<br/>-A quick rules summary and perhaps a list of the dice used in the game.<br/>-Roaches!!!<br/><br/>For playing pieces, you could use different colored plastic figurines of professors.  And when they get roached, just replace the professor with the same colored roach.<br/><br/>But for a prototype, don't worry about the art and all that.  Just get some cardboard or even paper and markers and do a super-rough prototype.  You only need it to be playable...not pretty.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frederik%20J.%20Jensen" title="Frederik J.

The board is a means to have all the bits in sight that make up The Roach experience. Also, I hope the goal is to inform players about their choices, so role-playing is enhanced by picking up the elements on the board. Another old idea of mine is to have 'inspiration' cards that add some sort of context that players can base their scenes on (these days, people would call it a Roach Oracle or something I guess). <br/><br/>Having counters that represent the prominent Pembertonians lying on the map is a great idea. Connecting them with certain locations makes sense with a board in mind, too.<br/><br/>I will do a first playtest in two weeks with people who know the game as-is, so I will have something other than my musings to reflect on soon.
