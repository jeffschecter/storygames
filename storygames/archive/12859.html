And that person Y can make better games than me, even if I do my very very best. <br/><br/>[EDIT] Retracting the following statement on second thought, leaving it here only so people can understand the thread:<br/><br/>And, indeed, it's possible that person Z just... shouldn't really try to design a game, because it would be crap.<br/><br/>[/EDIT]<br/><br/> Or that, even if they tried, they actually <i>wouldn't be able to finish it</i>.<br/><br/><b>Does this mean I think people should not try to make games?

It's this kind of crap that discourages people from trying their hand at game design. "Oh, SOME people shouldn't try because they won't finish, but that doesn't mean YOU, or in general. Just people I won't name." <br/><br/>Not every game is going to be fantastic. Not every song is going to be a hit. But every act of creation, half-assed or badass or whatever else, is in and of itself a small miracle, because boom! Something where once was nothing. That's amazing.

We didn't think too hard about it -- it's what we were always doing. It was part of why we were there. Every game was an invitation to fix, expand, extend, revise, and reskin. Often it was an inspiration to build something new from scratch (because a lot of early games sucked in a lot of awesome ways).<br/><br/>We played boardgames and wondered if we could use them as a basis for role-playing games. We found a cool set of miniatures and tried to make an existing game bend to incorporate them (goddam, that guy has armour and a light saber wtf? I want to play HIM). We built thin frameworks that let us make huge strategic campaigns out of wargames, stringing together many battles with a continuous political theme.<br/><br/>Every person at every table at every session had something to say about game design. It was the secret part of why we were all there. We had great times.<br/><br/>From about 1975 to 1995 every single person I encountered who was into role-playing games was doing this. I'm not saying everyone can or wants to, but this was the demographic that was playing everywhere I looked.<br/><br/>So I'll flip the OP around a little: if you're designing a game that doesn't invite this, what the fuck?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289574/#Comment_289574" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-29T09:54:05+00:00" title="August 29, 2010  9:54AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 29, 2010 9:54AM by Matthijs.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't see what's so inflammatory about my post.

I didn't think anyone was actually advocating what he was railing against.<br/><br/>I'm all for high-fiving game designers for making cool games. I love it when people create things. I like meeting the people who have made the comics I read, and have inspired me to try my hand at it. I like meeting the people who have made the games I play because it's inspired me to play more and to try designing my own.<br/><br/>I am not so excited about the idea that game designers are magical people, a cut above, a breed greater than lesser humans who have "extraordinary talents that deserve to be lauded." I do not think there are some people who shouldn't make games because they won't be that great or because they won't be finished. Not-great games can be improved with help and feedback. Unfinished games are just steps towards finished games.<br/><br/>For me where this whole thing has gone wrong is that playing games with the people who designed them has actually worked against the whole Cult of the Designer that Judd talked about in the sister-thread. It's showed me that they're normal people, gamer geeks like me, who have put a lot of work in designing something cool. I am really excited that they are making things that I can use and things that I love. But I've also realized that they are normal humans just like me and that I can design games too. Or I can not design games and that's okay too. I don't need to strive to be a capital letter Game Designer because there is no such thing.<br/><br/>I have found nothing special or brilliant in any of the game designers I've met. I've found people, some really cool and a couple total twats, who are willing to work really hard at this thing and see it through. The people who aren't game designers? They have things in their own lives that they are willing to work really hard at. The fruits of that just aren't going to be at my gaming table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray" title="Tim_Gray"><img alt="Tim_Gray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray">Tim_Gray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289576/#Comment_289576" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-29T10:09:17+00:00" title="August 29, 2010 10:09AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting reactions!<br/><br/>If you take it to the implementation stage and say that not everyone can design and publish a book (inc pdf books) and have it come out well, I'll agree.

Indie RPGs, for the most part, came out of a feeling that no one else was making what people wanted to play, so people made those games themselves. There's a strong DIY mentality, and a strong collaborative and creative energy in this community because it's predicated on the idea that this is what anyone can do. <br/><br/>The stuff you're saying about indie dilettantes is stuff I have heard VPs and higher-ups in traditional game companies say about our best and brightest. It sounds like what people say to discourage others from creation, and I'm not down with that. When anyone starts acting like design is this rareified thing, like any of us are doing anything more than helping each other play pretend, it injures the hobby. It discourages outside voices, outside perspectives, and fresh ideas. <br/><br/><i>Everyone</i> can design games, and when you discourage people from trying their hand at it, the less bad games there will be\u2014 but there will less games that truly surprise you, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289579">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289579/#Comment_289579" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-29T10:15:28+00:00" title="August 29, 2010 10:15AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think everybody probably agrees with everybody or the differences in opinion are miniscule, we are just all being On The Internet so miniscule differences in opinion become big deals that need to be turned into their own threads.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289583">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray" title="Tim_Gray"><img alt="Tim_Gray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray">Tim_Gray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289583/#Comment_289583" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-29T10:25:03+00:00" title="August 29, 2010 10:25AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Elizabeth, the original post doesn't say anything about stopping people from making games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289587/#Comment_289587" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-29T10:30:45+00:00" title="August 29, 2010 10:30AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tim, of course it doesn't.

Getting back in again - thanks, Elizabeth and Bret, for helping me understand where you're coming from!<br/><br/>First of all: I was sloppy in my first post. This bit:\n<blockquote>it's possible that person Z just... shouldn't really try to design a game, because it would be crap</blockquote>\n...I don't agree with, in hindsight. I think that everyone who wants to design a game, should do it. There is <i>absolutely no way</i> of telling if person Z can make a good game before they try. Also, there's simply no standard these things can be measured objectively by - and in 100 years, I might be more famous than Luke Crane. (It's all that keeps me going, to be honest.)<br/><br/>Second, though: I don't think every act of creation is a miracle. This is just a matter of opinion, of course. I think there are more than enough games. Again, I want people to do whatever they like, create etcetera; but sometimes I wish we could all just take a three-year break and play the games that are actually out there, getting no recognition.<br/><br/>Third: I do think design can be a marvellous and magical thing. I don't expect everyone to agree; but I see good (of course, "good" in my opinion, right) game design as a high art form, and I think the best designers are wonderful artists. Sure they're just people! Picasso was just a fuckhead, and LeGuin is just this old woman, etc. I'm sure even Saint Vincent the Baker sometimes farts. That doesn't mean we can't think they're brilliant artists. And be their fans. (And yes, we're all helping each other play pretend - I mean, reading a Nobel-prize-winning nobel is just playing pretend in your head. I think.)<br/><br/>In the end, being a fan is a weird thing, though. I'm in two minds about it, even though I can't seem to avoid being a rabid fanboy myself at times.

Hard work can take a person a long, long way. There's nothing wrong with respecting someone for their ability to see the world in a unique way, so long as that respect is in the context of their humanness and not something that makes you set them apart as Other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289594/#Comment_289594" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-29T10:51:31+00:00" title="August 29, 2010 10:51AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>In the end, being a fan is a weird thing, though.

I've spent a lot of time over the last few years thinking about this, and I'm met a lot of people that I'm a fan of. That's made me realize that I'm a fan of my friends as well -- I know improv folks and awesome players -- and that being a fan isn't in and of itself weird.<br/><br/>Letting that fandom define your relationship, well, maybe. But that happens when your only relationship there is between you and the work a dude did rather than the dude himself. It's only natural that that leads to being curious about the person behind the work, and that you feel admiration for this person upon first meeting.<br/><br/>Anyway, sorry for the derail.

Everyone can design a game. It's like how everyone can draw a picture of a flower.  You just do it, period.  And there it is: a game.<br/><br/>2. Whether a game is "good" or not is completely subjective, depending on what you want from it. Maybe it isn't particularly successful as a game, but tells you a great deal about the author (insight) or, 20 years down the road, becomes a record of what they were thinking about at the time (nostalgia).  Everything is potentially valuable and useful and "good" to someone.  And the rest doesn't matter.  Why would anyone want to judge all games by the same set of criteria?  Why should every game aspire to be D&amp;D or Dogs in the Vineyard?  That's bullshit.  You have to know your (subjective) criteria before you decide how to judge a game.<br/><br/>3. Everyone can learn to make games that work better as games (i.e. creating a consistently enjoyable experience for their players, based on whatever subjective criteria you have for play), given practice and a desire to learn from others.  Actually, you can learn to make games that are better at whatever subjective criteria you have, if it's selling more copies, or causing more controversy, or making you more famous amongst your peers or whatever.  People are good at learning to do things.  All it takes is time and dedication.  Of course, people have different capacities for getting better and different learning speeds, especially as we get older, but I believe that everyone can make incremental progress if they put in the time and energy.  That's one of the simple joys and rewards of being alive.<br/><br/>4. Does that mean that everyone can make a game that will be hugely successful at their own subjective criteria?  No.  You can definitely get closer to your criteria or more successful, but nothing guarantees that you will be successful at anything you want to do.  The challenge and uncertainty is also part of life simple pleasures and vexing frustrations.<br/><br/>5. Sometimes this means, in order to be hugely successful by your own (subjective) standards, you have to change the criteria by which you measure yourself and your games.  Maybe you just want to write the best 2-player game about zombies ever written.  That's probably possible.  Will it sell a billion copies and make you world famous?  Probably not.  Who cares though?  You did it.  You met your criteria.  Maybe you want to hack an existing game and run a really memorable campaign that your home playgroup will never forget.  Badass.  Do that.<br/><br/>A lot of this comes out of my own frustrations and personal journey over the past 10 years or so, coming to terms with my own design and publishing goals and ability to execute on them (at least at this stage in my life).  So, changing your personal criteria for success is something near and dear to my heart.  I do it all the time and feel like it's probably critical for human beings to stay sane and satisfied.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.

Take language as an example. After the age of about 12 you have almost 0% chance to learn a new language with the fluency of a native speaker. I imagine that similar benchmarks and early development strongly shape peoples ability to do anything: design games, play music, draw pictures. This means that some decisions we make as adults will have limits that we cannot control. Normally these limits are surmountable, but it becomes a question of effort v. payoff. If I have to spend the next decade to make a game I will be satisfied with, is that worth it? What about 20, what about 50. How many other things will I have to not do in order to make my game? Etc... so, most anyone can attempt to design a game (barring extreme birth defects or other disabilities) and nearly everyone can make the game that they're satisfied with in the course of their life time, but is it worth it, to them to do so? As far as excellence by some sort of societal or cultural standard, well, that functions within the same boundaries: is it worth it. Given an infinite span of time I imagine anyone could be a Jackson Pollack, but we don't have infinity, we have mortality, so, people just have to choose what to do with it and they should (if they want to be effective in their life times) be realistic about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289818/#Comment_289818" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T09:24:10+00:00" title="August 30, 2010  9:24AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ken Sentowski!</cite>The democratization of design is nonsense.</blockquote>\nThis is nonsense.

To a point. Designing a dungeon for your friends to enjoy is a kind of level design. The dialogue you conjure on the spot is improvisational script writing, in a way. When you stray from a typical combat encounter into some kind of extreme environmental challenge or riff on the combat system, you may be tinkering with the underlying mechanical systems. <br/><br/>That, to an extent, democratizes the design, what, experience?<br/><br/>Designing for the home game isn't the same as designing a game for publication, as I think another thread is discussing right now, though. But I think people in this thread may be arguing with slightly different definitions of design. What is design?

As an ever-changing group of people, we've changed a lot about how people perceive games and game design. This has been a positive thing on the whole, and we're all very pleased with having done it. Yay us.<br/><br/>For example, we "democratized" design, which is to say we made design something that any schmo could do, and that also chipped away at the notion that companies and their employees should be giving us fun designs. And, that we should also elevate the status of those people for having done so. <br/><br/>However, there is ALWAYS a tradeoff. <br/><br/>Other things happened in doing so, too.<br/><br/>For one, we created an environment that cherished particular values, and either criticized or felt threated by others. I believe this results in a blinding effect, and probably also an environment where challenging certain things is a no-no.<br/><br/>For example, we cherish innovation. We also cherish the craftsmanship in individuals creating interesting looking publications. <br/><br/>We do not cherish, say, design that does not innovate in the interest of appealing to a wider audience of gamers ("trad" gamers, or whatever you wish to call it -- you get the point). We don't do this, despite the probability that doing so would mean individual publishers would have more sales.<br/><br/><br/>When Keith says democratization is nonsense, I understand what he means. I don't think Jonathan has the same perspective. It's no crime; they're just coming at it from different angles. <br/><br/>I share Keith's perspective on a bunch of these topics above. It's something he and I share and talk about -- things like how limited in business scope we approach things in this community. We haven't talked about it with Jonathan ever, as far as I can recall. <br/><br/>I'm pretty sure I also understand what Jonathan means, and why it's good, not nonsense, that we've democratized design.<br/><br/>But, I think we have a situation here in which the community I have been a part of for 10 years is at a point where it's quite happy with the viability, direction, and commercial success of its endeavors. And, I'm wildly disatisfied with that same situation.<br/><br/>So, I read "nonsense" from that perspective. Democratization has been a fantastic thing. It's achieved good. <br/><br/>But, when that good is sort of abstractly compared to the good other things have done in gaming, the scope is painfully small. <br/><br/>This is not to say we accomplished zero. It is to say that our reach and resources have limited things far more than I ever would have guessed back in, say, 2006.<br/><br/>One can pretty easily argue that, say, Organized Play, did good for the hobby in terms of commercial viability, at least. In comparison to the indie scene, that amount of good is "bigger." So are several other things, games, companies, people, etc. And, thus, I wish we could have done more.<br/><br/>I'm beginning to believe, based on my experiences and observations, that our community is apathetic to this in general. That its values and mine diverged about 1-2(?) years ago. I'd love to find out I'm wrong about that, and our values and priorities overlap far more than I suspect currently.<br/><br/>This isn't a "fight" -- hippie games and I simply go in parallel directions or something. That's ok. <br/><br/>And, so, I think these kinds of things are hard to talk about without a pissing match because of the difference in those values and priorities. I'm VERY interested in talking about these priorities and how they differ from what I see in this community (i.e. hippe indie games, not just SG!). Another thread, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289859/#Comment_289859" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T10:30:59+00:00" title="August 30, 2010 10:30AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jared A.

How well you do something shows how much inherent ability you have.  Things that come easy to you define your talents; if you stick with those things, you'll do well.  Things that don't come easy to you show your inherent flaws and weaknesses.  You can't do anything well if you don't have a natural talent for it.  Failing is scary because it can prove that the talents you thought you had aren't real after all.<br/><br/>GROWTH:<br/><br/>People's inherent abilities are only starting points; you can't know from your starting point how far you can possibly go.  A given person may or may not be able to reach a given level of ability, but there is no way of knowing that until you try -- and in fact, there's no way of knowing even if you do try and fail, whether you could get there by trying more.  There is always the possibility of success with greater effort -- the only question is whether you want to expend that effort in the hope of success or put your efforts elsewhere.  There is always room to improve, in one direction or another -- there isn't "competent" and "incompetent" but many levels of relative competence.  Most people who perform with excellence once performed badly, but kept working at it.  Saying "so-and-so isn't good at X" doesn't say anything one way or the other about whether they will ever be good at it -- and saying "so-and-so is good at X" doesn't imply that they were always good at it.<br/><br/>=====<br/><br/><br/>It sounds like some parts of this thread are a clash between the fixed and growth mindsets.<br/><br/>Other parts are about a lot of other things.<br/><br/>But coming at the issue of "can everyone design games" from the fixed mindset, the answer is -- of course not, only the talented ones can.  And from the growth mindset, the answer is -- probably yes, eventually, if they are willing to work at it and learn; there's no way of knowing you *can* except by trying and succeeding; there's no way of knowing that you can't, definitively; you can only know "I couldn't do so successfully given the amount of effort I have put forth so far, and I've invested as much effort as I'm willing to do on this."<br/><br/>I find Dweck's work convincing, though I think there are other things to consider along with her two mindsets.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289964/#Comment_289964" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T13:03:20+00:00" title="August 30, 2010  1:03PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jared A. Sorensen</cite>(art) Design for yourself \u2014&gt; Design for friends \u2014&gt; Design for strangers \u2014&gt; Design for customers \u2014&gt; Design for retailers (commerce)<br/><br/>There's more responsibility for/expectation of quality as you move down the chain, until the very last step, when quality of packaging trumps quality of design</blockquote>\nI can't speak for quality here, but I think the same chain works to describe the transition from highly personalized design to highly generalized design.<br/><br/>When people design things for themselves or their friends, they know what their audience likes and they can zero in on it.  When they start designing for people they don't know, that level of highly personalized specificity becomes impossible, because...well, they don't know those people, and don't know what those people will like.  And there's nothing wrong with that, as long as both the designer and the strangers involved are aware that this is going to happen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
