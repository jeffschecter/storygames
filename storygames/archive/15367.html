It was a climax for the techniques and tools I've been collecting for years and it was glorious. A few players said, "give me what you got." So this is me with the giving.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Warning: </b><br/>\n<br/>\nIf you haven't run Dogs, ignore this thread. Read the game, do what the text says, it's great. Don't let me corrupt you! Especially don't skip the Town Creation rules. That book is gold. Ignore me, read it instead.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Where I try not to sound too much like a fanboy: </b><br/>\n<br/>\nDogs is my favorite game, it got me back into roleplaying. I've run it well over 100 times for easily 200-300 people (I've lost count, and no, I'm not exaggerating) and it's gold 9 out of 10 times. When I run (mostly 1 shots), I don't want it to feel like the first session of an ongoing campaign. I want it to feel like a movie, squeezing every moment of drama I can out of those 4 hours. To that end, I've playtested and refined techniques to make that happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>1. Custom Character Sheets.</b><br/>\n<br/>\n<img alt="Character-Sheet.jpg" class="bbcode_img" src="http://nerdnyc.com/tmp/dogs/Character-Sheet.jpg"/><br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://nerdnyc.com/tmp/dogs/Character-Sheet.pdf" rel="nofollow">Download here [PDF].</a><br/>\n<br/>\nCharacter Sheets are redesigned, Apocalypse World style. Every Background gets its own Character Sheet, its own unique list of names, example traits, and example belongings.<br/>\n<br/>\nEverything you need to make a character is on the sheet. All the words have been chosen carefully to communicate very specific ideas that will later feed back into play.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause these techniques are optimized for 1 shots, I want character creation to go fast. Pre-gens can rob you of investment, so I've compromised. Each Background has their unique dice pre-assigned on the sheet but you still assign your own stats, and make up your own custom Traits and Belongings.<br/>\n<br/>\nBiggest change: You don't make up your own Relationships.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore next post...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_348944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348944/#Comment_348944" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-15T09:56:45+00:00" title="November 15, 2011  9:56AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>2. Relationships</b><br/>\n<br/>\n<img alt="Little-Valley-NPCs.jpg" class="bbcode_img" src="http://nerdnyc.com/tmp/dogs/Little-Valley-NPCs.jpg"/><br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://nerdnyc.com/tmp/dogs/Little-Valley-NPCs.pdf" rel="nofollow">Download Here [PDF].</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI give you a list of NPCs to choose from. 2 of your Relationships have to be shared with other players. And you decide how you know these NPCs. Maybe I thought this NPC was a good person but you decide she killed your Uncle. All cool. I give examples to inspire people to go crazy. Who almost killed you? Who did you almost kill? Who saved you from sin? Whose sin did you forgive? Who's your daughter? Who's your dad? Who do you love? Who hates you? Whose secret do you know? Who knows your secret?<br/>\n<br/>\nGo nuts! I find it works best if I put the list of NPCs in the middle of the table and walk away. I'll leave the room for 5+ minutes to communicate "this isn't about me, you own this."<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect you can imagine the tangled web of drama that ensues.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>3. Rules</b><br/>\n<br/>\n<img alt="Conflict-Sheet.jpg" class="bbcode_img" src="http://nerdnyc.com/tmp/dogs/Conflict-Sheet.jpg"/><br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://nerdnyc.com/tmp/dogs/Conflict-Sheet.pdf" rel="nofollow">Download Here [PDF]</a><br/>\n<br/>\nMost people I play with have never played Dogs before. Many have never played an RPG. Enter the Conflict Sheet above. I give everyone their own copy when the first conflict starts and use it to teach the rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may notice, something's not right! Alert the game design police!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy do I get to keep 2 dice if I give? What's this "alone and in trouble" and "make a promise you don't want to keep" under Short Term Fallout? What is this madness?<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the first 50 times running Dogs, I started tweaking to take what I already love about the game and squeeze as much as I can out of it (in very much a, "what would Vincent do kind of way"). I made one tweak at a time that I then tested 10+ times. Most of the tweaks aren't even mine. Their Vincent's! Specifically from Vincent's <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=201" rel="nofollow">unpublished horror version of Dogs in the Vineyard called Afraid</a>. So what's changed?<br/>\n<br/>\n- I've renamed a few terms to make the game easier for new players.<br/>\n- I use a modified version Afraid's "make NPCs on the fly" rules.<br/>\n- I use Afraid's Escalation. If you Escalate when someone attacks you, you ignore that attack and attack back!<br/>\n- I use Afraid's rules for Giving. You keep your 2 highest dice. People Give In a lot more!<br/>\n- I've changed some of the Fallout options to optimize play for 4 hours.<br/>\n- I've changed the Helping rules so you can offer limited help without being involved in a conflict.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's it! Nothing too crazy but these are hammered, refined, and tested to exhaustion.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore next post...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_348945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348945/#Comment_348945" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-15T09:57:26+00:00" title="November 15, 2011  9:57AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>4. Presenting / Teaching</b><br/>\n<br/>\nI have a script for presenting and teaching the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://nerdnyc.com/tmp/dogs/GM-Sheet.pdf" rel="nofollow">Download Here [PDF].</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThings like saying,<br/>\n<br/>\n"You play Teenage virgin gunslinger priest with ultimate power and zero life experience. You're a kid who gets 2 months of training, a bible, and a gun\u2026 now go proclaim judgment!"<br/>\n<br/>\nTo time management stuff for the GM,<br/>\n<br/>\n"Set three alarms. Assuming your game is 4 hours, set alarms for '3 hours left' (character creation &amp; initiations should be done), '2 hours left' (major conflicts should be obvious), and '45 minutes left' (play to a climax)."<br/>\n<br/>\nTo warnings like,<br/>\n<br/>\n"Dogs is a mature game that sometimes deals with racism and sexism. If at any point you don't feel comfortable with anything in the game, lift up this 'X' card and we will edit that content."<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd setting expectations,<br/>\n<br/>\n"I've run these towns dozens of times and they never end the same way. Sometimes not one bullet is fired. Other times the Dogs kill each other in the first scene. I'm not in control. Don't blame me! You are responsible for what happens!"<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>5. GM Techniques</b><br/>\n<br/>\nThe <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://nerdnyc.com/tmp/dogs/GM-Sheet.pdf" rel="nofollow">PDF above (presenting / teaching)</a> also includes Dogs specific GM advice. Things like\u2026<br/>\n<br/>\n- Make judgment hard! Good people do bad things for good reasons. Bad people do good things for terrible reasons! The bad people think they are the good people. The victims justifiably become the bullies. The bad people want to repent but the good people want revenge. The bad people are surrounded by people who love them and have good reasons for loving them. There are no bad people.<br/>\n<br/>\n- For each Dog, pick 1 Trait that best represents what they are about. For each Trait, write down its opposite ("peaceful" becomes "violence is always the answer") and write down its extreme ("peaceful" becomes "never commit violence"). Give these new Traits to the NPCs.<br/>\n<br/>\n- When creating NPCs, I like a 50/50 split between females and males. Create the NPC first without a gender and then roll randomly.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Write down the name of someone you know personally or a character you enjoy from film/tv/books next to each NPC as a guideline for how to roleplay them. Sometimes write down 2 names and merge them.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Great NPCs to include: an outsider not of the faith, a recent convert, a failed Dog, a retired Dog, a mad Dog, a mountain person, people who deeply and genuinely love the "bad guys", females with male roles, males with female roles, someone who thinks they can go a better job than the Dogs, outside authority, a former sinner the Dogs saved, someone who was possessed by a demon, people who love you.<br/>\n<br/>\n- The player who has done the least goes next! Pass the spotlight!<br/>\n<br/>\n- Cut away between players not when a conflict ends\u2026 but when it starts! It's like a cliffhanger every scene! More tension that way.<br/>\n<br/>\n- 90% of the time, the first things the Dogs will do is talk / blame the Steward or demand the entire town gather for a group meeting. Plan accordingly. NPCs do stupid things when they are afraid.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Split the Dogs up! Have their loved ones ask to speak to them privately. Have two emergencies happen at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Sit closest to the quietest player, farthest from the loudest.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd much more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_348946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348946/#Comment_348946" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-15T09:58:01+00:00" title="November 15, 2011  9:58AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>6.

(You know I've been encouraging you for a long time to get your ideas down on paper, and, boy, am I glad you've done it!) I really like some of the new changes from last time, like how you've streamlined Fallout options for stuff that impacts play directly.<br><br>I have a few thoughts:<br><br>1. I remember you leaving out the "Well-Rounded" background in the past, based on the fact that it doesn't communicate anything about the character. Why did you decide to put it back in? Is it because you wanted to have a fifth "playsheet"?<br><br>2. You got rid of healing conflicts entirely? I'm guessing this is because it's for a one-shot situation, am I right? That makes sense to me: since risking one's life is already at the player's choice, might as well make it meaningful. If you put down your life for something, and it's a one-shot, it's more dramatic (not to mention faster) if you DO lay down your life for that thing.<br><br>3. The first character sheet has: "belongings - a Dog" ... surely you meant to write, "belongings - a dog". Yes? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br><br>4. I agree with Dave, that the conflict sheet looks very daunting. Do you encourage people to have it in front of them and read through it as they play? Or may only when you're dealing with someone else, so they can be ready when you get back to them? I feel like having all that text in front of you might take you away from that great dramatic effect you get with Dogs.<br><br>5. The relationship stuff is HOT. I don't know if you got the idea from me or vice-versa, but I always do this with Dogs towns, too: I like to make a relationship map of the Town (by the regular rules), and THEN allow the players to surprise me with their interpretation of the characters. It's always surprising and amazing. Like maybe the murderer, it turns out, was someone mentor or younger brother (something you'd feel very heavy-handed inventing yourself), or the proud Steward was a criminal from the Dog's childhood.<br><br>6. You say you roll NPC genders randomly. How does that interact with the very traditional way gender roles work in the "Dogsverse"? Vincent's concept of the life of these people is so heavily wrapped up in gender issues (patriarchal roles, polygamy, etc), that I could see randomizing gender working against the thematic concepts in the scenario.<br><br>Thanks!<br><br>I can proudly say I learned to play Dogs from John: we played just one game, I observed what John was doing, and I've always had success running Dogs since then!

I found it drains energy and time in 1 shots. Also, I often put a Dog's life on the line as part of what is at Stake, so we can still have healing conflicts without added rules.

There was a lot of  serendipity in our last few games that was partially encouraged by patterns I embedded up front. Humans are great at pattern recognition, we just need to tip the process in specific directions. <br><br>I also just realized... the way we choose Relationships above is a form of Lore Sheets from Weapon of the Gods! <br><br>You are investing dice resources into the elements of the setting you are most interested in, giving buy in, and then customizing those elements to your interests. Which makes GMing so much easier, because I'm just giving you what you want. Kind of like Beliefs in Burning Wheel. The whole setup becomes a subtle communication tool that helps focus the game increasing the chance for success. <br><br>Which is why I LOVE Burning Wheel / Mouse Guard!<br><br>Beliefs aren't a way to force characters to roleplay a specific way. Fate/Persona points aren't bribes to roleplay awesome. The whole system is a communication tool meant to encourage players to make their interests and motivations external to everyone else at the table. Beliefs don't take control away from you. You get rewarded for playing your Beliefs AND playing against them. And you can change them at any time (with a few limits)! So Beliefs can be anything. But if you don't interact with them, you don't get Fate/Persona which the system is weighted so that you fail more often than not without them. So at the end of the session, you really want Fate/Persona, but if you don't get them, it means your Beliefs aren't being interacted with, which is a signal that they need updating. Once you update them, everyone at the table now knows what you are currently interested in, and playing becomes so much easier!                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349042/#Comment_349042" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-16T09:23:50+00:00" title="November 16, 2011  9:23AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: kobutsu</cite>The town creation rules have never worked for me.

Whenever you have time. Here or in another thread, whatever is most convenient for you.<br/><br/>What doesn't work for you?<br/><br/>Why does it not push you to make bad things happen to good people?<br/><br/>Why do I ask? I think by seeing where things don't work, we can build new tools which could help people running Dogs or even people designing new games.<br/>This wasn't addressed to me, but I had some problems with the town creation rules when I played. I think I eventually figured out some rules of thumb that helped me get it right, but I'm not sure they're universal. <br/><br/>First, the rules are a little vague on how much tension to create:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dogs in the Vineyard p. 113-114</cite>1C: If the situation seems grabby enough to you, which it probably won't but if it does, you can stop. Skip ahead to step 6.<br/>2D: If you've got enough NPCs to keep the PCs busy and you're happy with the situation, you can stop. Skip ahead to step 6.<br/>3D: If you've taken the situation as far as you want to, you can stop. Skip ahead to step 6.<br/>4D: If you're happy with the situation, you can stop. Skip ahead to step 6.<br/>5B: Stop now, or repeat 5a until the situation is grabby enough for you. Unresolved, murder leads to more murder.</blockquote>\nThose rules are easy to follow if you already know how much tension should make you happy, but if you don't it can be hard to puzzle out. I adopted the rule of thumb that I needed enough people tied up with each other that removing one wouldn't completely unravel the tension in the town (because it's pretty easy to kill an NPC in a conflict, and a town that is resolved in a single conflict isn't meaty enough for a full session). It's tempting to follow the progression by making the initial sinner do worse and worse stuff, but this tends to produce towns that have a single obvious villain, which tends to violate my "no single key NPC" rule of thumb. The "trick", which I picked up from reading forum threads, is to have the victims of sin, injustice, etc., be the ones that escalate to the next level. This leads to towns that are more nuanced, since it's easy to sympathize with the motives of those who have been wronged. Also, when I've tried to escalate to Hate and Murder I would usually find the tension leaking out of my situation instead of increasing it as the rules imply, since I was having one NPC murder the person they were in tension with. I'm now thinking that the murder should always be some third party, since that increases the number of victims and hard feelings in the town without decreasing the tension from the earlier steps.<br/><br/>I also adopted a rule of thumb to never make the tension in the situation contingent on demonic attacks. I find the rules frustratingly vague about how to handle the supernatural in the game. If the demonic attacks seem discrete enough that it could be valid conflict stakes to make them stop then they can't be a linchpin for the tension. (For example, I tried to make a town where the demonic attacks were manifesting as equipment failures at the sawmill, putting a lot of people out of work, which led to other problems. The PCs immediately wanted to perform a ritual on the mill to get rid of the demons. I was flummoxed, since that seemed like it ought to be within the supernatural capabilities of the Dogs but it would also let all the people go back to work and eliminate all the economic tensions that were causing problems between the people in the town, which meant there was little reason to interact with any of the NPCs).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu" title="kobutsu"><img alt="kobutsu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c22b7a0141698356c899c4f7f1200ed7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu">kobutsu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349054/#Comment_349054" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-16T12:47:27+00:00" title="November 16, 2011 12:47PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dan Maruschak</cite>It's tempting to follow the progression by making the initial sinner do worse and worse stuff, but this tends to produce towns that have a single obvious villain</blockquote><p>Right.

When I run through the list, it feel like a funnel toward murder but it also has a few branches like:\n<blockquote>So far everything has been individual. One person is resentful of injustices, then commits sins, then adopts weird beliefs. False Priesthood is when the heretic develops a following. The followers may themselves be anywhere on the continuum\u2014 they might be heretics in their own right, they might just be sinners or proud, they might even be humble and decent but misled. The point is that now the heresy has the force of a (sub-)community behind it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>You can also repeat steps if you want. A town might have one situation going all the way up to murder, and a second, unrelated situation still at the sin level, and then four more budding prides. If I wanted a town to take more than a session or two to sort out, that\u2019s how I\u2019d do it.</blockquote>\nIn my experience with usability testing, I've found how you say something is more important than what you say. Which can be frustrating for the creator and reader!<br/><br/>Funny enough, I just found this as if Vincent was writing directly to Kit!\n<blockquote>If you like, try starting with the step corresponding with the level of wrongness you\u2019d like the town to have, and working backward. If it works, or if it spectacularly doesn\u2019t, write me!

It was for 4 people completely new to Dogs (1 had heard about it) but they all bought into my pitch about the setting, who you play, and me emphasising that it's a game for people who enjoy moral dilemmas. <br/><br/>(<i>I'm finding that when I'm pitching games at Games on Demand sessions that describing what you do and then describing what sort of creative rewards you'd get out of playing the game really works to let people know if they'd enjoy playing it. So, for instances, when I'm pitching Monsterhearts I say it's for people who like supernatural romance, and the horror of being a teenager.</i>)<br/><br/>It was a three-hour session, which was a bit tough. I decided to run only 2 initiations: one to teach the basic back and forth techniques, and then one to demonstrate traits and belongings and escalation.<br/><br/>I ran Point Hollow, which is a town the Dogs have been summoned to by a former cultist they saved from demonic possession. This former cultist (Sister Penance) has re-located to Point Hollow and using Jenskot's material I described how she'd written to them to say "It's happening again!"<br/><br/>As per the advice, I left the players alone for about 5 minutes so they could create relationships. When I came back I found that they had (oddly?) focused everything on about three NPCs, especially Sister Penance, and Br Onus (the Steward), and had left some relationship slots blank. I feel it might have been better if I'd suggested / told them to fill up all their relationship slots.<br/><br/>(John's characters sheets are great, BTW. I missed having the 'elements of ceremony' on them but that's a tiny thing.)<br/><br/>Arriving in town, the party split on the first scene. Three Dogs decided to stay and deal with Sister Penance savagely beating up a teenage boy: one of the Dogs was suspicious of Sr Penance from their previous dealings, the other believed in her - for a time I thought the two of them might come to blows but the scene didn't flow that way.<br/><br/>The fourth Dog left to confront a noted mercenary, Colt Bromley, who carrying a satchel of dynamite and heading up towards a crowd of protesting Mountain People. This fourth Dog initiated a conflict to get Bromley to drop the dynamite. Colt rolled super well, so I demonstrated why it's awesome to give to use Jenskot's alternate rules by giving, then taking my two 9s and launching a follow-up conflict with the stakes 'Shoot this upstart dog'. After some dynamite explosions and displays of athletic prowess (via reversing the blow), Colt stole the dog's horse and gun, and left him bleeding in the dust.<br/><br/>It was frickin' awesome and very tense. And it lead to a subsequent conflict in which two Dogs tried to take down Colt as he resupplied himself with dynamite. The fight was LONG. Normally I'd give, just for pacing - but Colt really came to life for me as a tenacious bastard who wouldn't let these striplings take him down. In the end, he bit the dust but both dogs rolled 19s on their fallout, so (in the fiction) they were pretty messed up.<br/><br/>We had to wrap the session up with only a few other conflicts playing out (including Sister Penance trying to kill herself out of guilt), so we moved into judgement mode. Upshot: Brother Onus is obvious weak (physically and morally (for allowing a second steward to be installed in the town). Onus'll be the temporary steward until the town elects a new one. In the meantime, Brother Rite will be returned to the Elders of the Faith for judgement, and the second 'silver' temple will be burned to the ground.<br/><br/>That's how we finished the game, with the credits rolling as the Dogs left town with Rite tied up and the smoke from the burning temple lifting into the sky.<br/><br/>It was lots of fun. Thanks again for helping with all your material, John!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment"
