Reading a few things about Scandinavian larps. Watching the film "Monster Camp" about NERO, which is a tap-them-with-your-stick-and-say-numbers action larp. Hearing accounts from a few people around my town of their experiences with a game that Ross Cowman used to run here, called Fantasy Capture The Flag.<br/><b><br/>My background with Shelter In Place:</b> heard about while it was being kickstarted, really like the cover, believe that it came out of the "story games community" &amp; so therefore would prioritize stuff that i care about even though a lot of disparate games come out of this community. I saw some shaky dark video in which jason morningstar was ducking out of a tent but i couldn't really see what was going on so i didn't watch much. Harry (who moderated for us) had it on the convention registry thing &amp; so i signed up excitedly with a lot of other people. I respect Harry a lot and love playing tabletop games with him. I knew shelter in place was about zombies &amp; hadn't read anything about it.<br/><br/><b>My expectations:</b> That i would run around trying to avoid zombies, that there would be some elegant abstracted way for the zombies and humans to physically interact, that the humans would have fun goals that would be doomed, that i would get to fluidly become a zombie in a way that was satisfying and then obey a different set of rules. I didn't think there'd be much story creation - there isn't really room to create new material in a zombie story. I expected to portray a generic human who was very similar to myself.<br/><br/><br/><b>How it went down.</b><br/><br/>Harry had assembled a lot of props, taped rules to them and scattered them about a room which was one-third of a ballroom. It was pretty sparse, terrain-wise, but it was still interesting. Reminded me of DOOM style games, where there's just hallways and bonus stuff. In the middle of the room was a craft-fair-style tent, dilapidated and set up with cubical dividers as walls. There was a Door and a Window clearly marked with signs on the ground. It looked super promising, and myself and around 20 other players divided ourselves into two groups and, as Mathalus would say, vibrated with excitement. <br/><br/>We were handed rules sheets to read, which were two-page spread blocks of text. I was a zombie, and told that i'd be a human in game two. The mechanics for combat, which seemed to be the thing that the zombies were trying to make happen in the game, seemed simple.<br/><br/>We started play, with the humans outside the room. I wandered around as a zombie, dragging a foot, flopping back and forth, letting my spine be fluid. That part was fun. The humans suddenly ran into the room! I shambled towards them, and they all ran into the shelter. My fellow zombies and i prowled around outside the tent.<br/><br/>In fact, the game was fun up until the time when I interacted with the mechanics. <br/><br/>Most combats called for a "time out, moderator come untangle this for us." The zombies were universal, but the human team each had an exception-based rule of some kind, which led to immediate communication breakdown. In short, our first problem was a pedagogy one: we zombies didn't know to expect that the humans could all do different stuff and the humans didn't know one another's powers. Since things had to be paused but the game instructed us zombies to moan and the humans were excitedly yelling at one another, AND the setup had the "shelter" blocking sightlines, there were no universal timeouts. While the moderator was untangling something, other zombies would shamble up and try to interact with it. For example, one of the humans "counts" as being involved in a combat if he's not touching the other people in the combat [where most combats count only the participants who are touching one another] and zombies wouldn't realize that he's part of that combat b/c he's jumping around and yelling encouragement.<br/><br/>There was a lot of counting in the game. When a zombie attacked a human, they counted to three to start combat, then counted to ten to eat the human. The 3-count was so that other people could join in by touching, and the 10-count was so that more humans could show up and start a new three-count combat. After each three count, the number of players involved on each side count up their individual numbers (in act one, humans get 2 adds and zombies get 1... but individual humans can gain additional adds for completing mini goals. More on those in a sec.) and numbers from any weapons that they're carrying. This is not negligible time. More people gather, another combat starts on the tail of that last one, more counting happens. When a zombie is destroyed, they watch a clock for a minute to come back as another zombie. <br/><br/>The counting felt like work, or like punishment. Why are we being made to count so much? When do i get to run around again? The problem of combat worsened when the zombies laid siege to the shelter - now the humans also had a basic Door or Window add, plus barricade adds from pieces of furniture strewn about for that purpose... and the combatants weren't within one another's sightlines, because some were in the shelter and some outside. Won or lose, the zombies destroyed the barricades - but if they lost, they couldn't attack again for 10 seconds, and one of the humans could fix furniture if they counted for a minute. Lots of counting.<br/><br/>The mini goals, which the humans could do to give themselves more adds for combat, were each unique to one human. At least one of them (get everyone to stay in the shelter for the whole first act) rewarded a terrible strategy. So whoever got that character has a secretly sucky character, who will fuck the humans over if people listen to them. Quick note - the wall of text was super hard when i became a human, trying to tease information out of the "flavor text" that i skimmed to find out the bonuses my character gave me. (I was supposed to be a businessman. I was so filled with adrenaline, though, that i just wanted to portray a scared human.) The mini goals in general i guess were in the game to have the humans have something to do... i feel like they were a bad way to do that. One good thing about them: at least three of the goals had a human trying to address the group and convince people to do something. The desperate yelling that took place resulted in confusion, which was very fruitful. <br/><br/>So, yeah, this act structure. Both times we played, the humans built a machine partway through the first act and that meant that they got to skip the second act and all but five minutes of the third act. Weird. I guess the five machine parts (brilliantly portrayed in our game by an N64, controller, rumble pak, etc.) are the plot device to end the game, but it was really disconcerting to have the moderator pause the game, advance us to almost the end, then all the numbers for our personal adds change we spend the last few minutes having to double-check our math and making bad calls because we think we're stronger than we are (as humans). <br/><br/>Also, spoiler alert: It seems that there's one near bulletproof strategy for the humans in act one: get the kid (who can't be bitten by zombies, though he can be engaged in combat) to roam around and pick up all the items and bring them to the shelter. Zombies can't attack the shelter in the first act. All the other humans, do nothing. Zombies, to counter-attack, spam-combat the kid. You can't kill her, but you can maybe slow her down long enough for the first act to end (half an hour) and then you can attack the shelter.<br/><br/>I think, as come to in conversation about this, that the designers were more interested in being faithful to movie tropes than focusing on the experience of the players.<br/><br/><b><br/>What was fun: </b>Being excited about the game before playing. Standing around as attendance was being called (to let in overflow sign-up if people were missing) and being stoked that i was gonna run around and do a physical thing with some of my friends who i see at conventions and don't really get to do physical things with (Johnzo, Jonathan Walton, etc, etc.) Zombie-ing around at the beginning. Hitting the cubical dividers and raoaring. Running (as a human) into the room and into the shelter. Stepping out of the shelter momentarily was exciting and nerve-wracking, which was fun in this context. Most important: Doing a new, weird thing with people i love a lot was really fun.<br/><br/><b>What was not fun:</b> Counting down for any reason. Counting how many people were frozen in a combat. Watching other players try to play effectively and having that be undercut by special rules that they didn't know, whether they were on items that other people were holding or other people's character sheets. Having numbers and rules that i was learning how to compare suddenly change on me with the changing acts. Having stereotyped human characters. Having the most effective strategy be for the humans to stay in the shelter. Most important: Stopping running around for any reason (in this case, constant rules clarification &amp; counting.) <br/><br/><br/>This game is hard to teach without playing it, or seeing it played. It seems more like a sport than a game - if you already knew what the different positions (aka characters) could do, and knew the numbers really well, i bet it could be fun. As it stands, we had fun despite it.<br/><br/>I'm very happy i played. Harry was a responsive moderator and a great host. I loved the work that he put into the props and shelter. The game could've obviously used a little more space and terrain, but i think we all made do quite well. Most important: now several of my cohorts and i are talking about LARPs again, excited about the possibilities of using our bodies in play. <br/><br/><br/>I wonder what situation this game is meant to be played in?<br/><br/>Any and all thoughts about Shelter in Place are welcomed, be they by people who've played, heard about, read it, whatever.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman" title="Ross_Cowman"><img alt="Ross_Cowman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2VVx8Kc--zY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACZ8/3Pco6NeJ4Ng/photo.jpg?sz=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman">Ross_Cowman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369317/#Comment_369317" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-26T20:05:28+00:00" title="March 26, 2012  8:05PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was tempted to contribute to the Kickstarter, but shied away when I could find no reference to the rules.

I had a good time when we played the other night, but it was definitely a learning experience and there's A LOT that I would do differently if I could do it over or ever decide to run it again. I don't necessarily want to speak to the mechanical details of the game quite yet, because I think a lot of the trouble folks experienced with rules confusion was my responsibility. I'd never run a LARP before, and there were a couple of key factors that I hadn't considered when we started playing, both of which had a bit to do with having much more experience with tabletop games.<br/><br/>The first was time management. I scheduled a two-hour slot, because my understanding was that the game took a couple of hours, and I really wanted to play later on Saturday, so when it was slotted between another LARP and the midnight game of Werewolf, I figured that would work out perfectly. I'd heard that it was really important to go through the full range of resolution rules before play, so as to make sure everything's clear for everyone, but I'd imagined that would take maybe ten minutes, and then we could get started without a whole lot of delay. What I'd failed into take into account was waiting for stragglers, taking attendance (!), bathroom breaks, etc. By the time we got started with rules stuff, it was close to twenty minutes into our slot already. If this had been a tabletop game, I wouldn't have sweated it; we could always work together to speed the game up or end on a cliffhanger or whatever, and there would be a break after our game, so it would be no big deal if we went a little over. But SIP games run on a timer, and there were folks waiting to use the room right after we finished, so I felt like we should start as quickly as possible, and I really breezed through the rules. <br/><br/>Handily enough, that leads into my second issue. When I play tabletop games, and especially when I teach them, I almost always like to get started as quickly as possible, bringing in the rules a little at a time as needed, rather than frontloading everything at the very beginning. That wasn't even something I was consciously thinking of when we were starting SIP, but it became clear pretty quickly that an approach like that doesn't work for a twenty-person LARP - there was too much going on to keep everyone on the same page as rules questions came up, and everything ground to a halt whenever we had to sort something out. In addition to that, one of the things I wasn't sure about was how much the players should know about the different items and everyone's powers beforehand, and I decided to err on the side of secrecy (or surprise), since that's what characters like The Evolved Zombie from our second round seemed to encourage. As we played, though, that seemed to cause much more confusion than it was worth.<br/><br/>In the end, Ross, I agree with you about elegance and transparency. Just out of curiosity, do you think there's a way to present SIP (as written) that might have preserved that? For example, if everyone wore a 9"x12" card with their resolution number and any special powers on it (preferably boiled down to a short phrase), would that have mitigated things at all?<br/><br/>Anyway, thanks again to Jackson for starting this thread. It was really interesting to see how everything shook out the other night, and I'd love to hear from other folks that have played or run the game about what worked well for them and what they ended up stumbling over.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369321/#Comment_369321" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-26T22:09:23+00:00" title="March 26, 2012 10:09PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jackson and Harry's experiences sound pretty much exactly like mine.  As I said in discussions later on, I think there's some technology that's typically used by larps in these kinds of situations (holding up fingers to represent your current value, or writing numbers on nametags or something), but none of us were experienced with any of that and the more experienced larpers who showed up to play seemed to be following our chaotic lead. Stopping to do math seemed to bring the drama of the game to a complete halt, as the frantic screaming gave way to a bunch of folks all trying to verify who had won, but -- as Jackson says -- typically this was happing irregularly all over the playing space, and the loads of varying rules meant that it happened uniquely every time, making it hard to feel like you had any real sense of what you were supposed to do in human-zombie combat (the core of the game).<br/><br/>Like Harry, I feel like it's hard to draw really solid conclusions about the mechanics from our first attempt at this, since a bunch of things happened that seemed to not be what the rules intended (like the machine being really easy to assemble in Act I, combat being totally baffling). I can imagine that -- if the larp took place in a much bigger space and the locations of the item weren't very clear -- the game could feel a lot more like running around playing capture the flag in a forest, and the 30-minute time limit on the first act would make a lot more sense, with the humans and zombies roaming around a large area, not often coming into close contact. Maybe that's what's intended?  I haven't read the rules, so I don't know.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369323/#Comment_369323" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-26T22:19:15+00:00" title="March 26, 2012 10:19PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 26, 2012 10:20PM by Hans_c-o.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My experiences echo. I had a lot of fun shambling around as a zombie, but because I wanted to have fun and knew how to entertain myself by just being crazy. The first few combats were fun until I realized that despite how simple it sounded I didn't really understand how it worked due to exceptions. The machine being easy to assemble in both cases was a letdown--we never saw Act II--and I imagine we lost some of the flow of the game there.<br/><br/>Being a human was confusing and not too fun. My character was bad at combat but had a goal to be involved in fights, but I didn't have much of a reason to go outside other than that, because we just had the kid get all the machine parts pretty quickly, then skipped to five minutes of Act III. I didn't do much as a human, really, and some of that may have been my fault. The second game went super fast, and I never got a handle on things from the human side.<br/><br/>It was a unique experience, and I'm very thankful to Harry for running and dealing with all the headaches!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369326/#Comment_369326" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-26T22:37:02+00:00" title="March 26, 2012 10:37PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds like a game that screams for laminated lanyards, or maybe even just cards people could slot into their badge holders.<br/><br/>For game states that can change, just flip the lanyard over or slot in a different card/badge.<br/><br/>That mechanic that allows you to skip a bunch of time kind of baffles me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_369330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369330/#Comment_369330" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-26T23:28:59+00:00" title="March 26, 2012 11:28PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seems to me this larp is an example that mechanics in a larp should be kept at an absolute minimum. Too much of them weakens the "live action" part of <i>live action role-playing</i>. Having to stop interaction due to "counting" (or other strange mechanics), in conflicts, is really the antithesis to the form of live action role-playing. <br/><br/>Giving rules that makes interaction flow on through conflicts, is a key to making larps that takes the players into the realm of intuitive physical interaction. Try to shed yourself of the competitive stance, and the mechanical debris of rpgs, and you may have a chance at designing and playing larps that blows your mind away.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369333/#Comment_369333" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-26T23:51:24+00:00" title="March 26, 2012 11:51PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jackson tegu</cite><br/>Any and all thoughts about Shelter in Place are welcomed, be they by people who've played, heard about, read it, whatever.</blockquote>\nHas anyone had awesome experiences with Shelter in Place?

I was on the opposite team from Jackson, Ross, Hans and JWalt. I had a blast! But I wasn't immune to the grinding halt of rules confusion or the limitations of the play space.<br/><br/>I was the businessman, and I had tons of fun with my goals and powers: I got a permanent bonus if I managed to lead everyone out of the shelter at once in Act 1, and I gave a bonus to a fight by yelling encouragement. The great thing about those two rules was that it put everyone into frantic conflict: fruitless argument with "stay in the shelter" guy, and blind terror and refusal when people begged me to help them in a fight. it didn't seem to me that the Goals were there to be completed (though bully for you if you do! I almost had mine, but one person decided to "stay behind ad guard the supplies."), but to create incompatible demands on each other and make tension and (fictional) tempers soar.<br/><br/>I had a great dynamic with Zach ("stay in shelter guy") and Johnzo ("Let us all pray for deliverance,") and when I got bit Zach had a great "He's infected, don't let him in!" moment with the Doctor who was dragging me to safety. The Doctor miming slapping me to my senses as he treated me was a great bit that possibly nobody else noticed.<br/><br/>That, in fact, it was extremely striking to me how much in LARP, moreso than any other roleplaying form, everyone's experiences differ. You may have a moment with one or two other people that most of the group simply doesn't witness, and that's just the way it works. I was really proud of my initial snooty corporate stooge interactions "Don't you know who I AM?!" "My company MAKES the weapons you take over to Afghanistan, who are you to bark orders at ME?") but it's possible none of y'all even heard them. similarly, other folks on my team told me about hilarious shit you zombies were doing--like Ross commenting on the quality of the furniture as he chewed on it, that i never noticed. Even in this small, very constrained game (spacewise, timewise, premisewise) most of us weren't aware of most of what was happening outside our bubble. I don't know if that's a feature, a bug, or just a thing.<br/><br/>(I just realized I was telling everyone this was my first LARP, but of course I played in The Upgrade! two years ago, hosted by Morningstar and Macklin. Which was hilarious and rad. Of course, that was a Jeepform, thus a divergent tradition, and didn't have the above quality near as much even with a similarly large cast, partly because you're all focused on what's "on screen" for the reality show.)<br/><br/>Since I was high on my really rad experience at the start of the game, the rules things didn't bug me so much--the confusion and issues were there, but they slid off my back a bit. By the time I got to be a Zombie for the second game, they were starting to stand out more.<br/><br/>A lot could be solved by, as people said above, having clear markers of who's got what. Even just fictionally, knowing who's the kid, especially when he's a dude taller than me, would really help with roleplaying interactions. I still don't know what character Zach had. And for the sake of points, yeah, delineate that shit. Any handling time you can shave off of ANY game is a boon, and LARP moreso times a billion.<br/><br/>The other thing that could help is a clear audible signal for timeouts. We tried handclaps for the second game, but it didn't seem to help much. Some kind of whistle or something, piercing but not painfully/annoyingly slow, could work wonders. 1 blast, everyone IN THE GAME freeze, 2 blastes everyone resume. (If you play in a larger space, this wouldn't work, but playing in a larger space would alleviate a lot of the difficulties anyway.)<br/><br/>Neither of these solutions will take away the "Counting ain't fun, it jarringly halts the tension and excitement") felt experience that a lot of us had. But they could make the game as designed run a lot smoother.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel<br/><br/>PS for those confused by the "skip to the end of the game" rule, it made a lot of sense in context: the game timer represents the time the humans have to hold out to get airlifted to safety. the device you assemble is a transmitter; once constructed you can call early for an airlift. when we got ours assembled in the first game, there was palpable sense of achievement and relief, followed by panic as the zombies renewed their assault. I found this mechanic a feature rather than a bug, but I understand what people are saying about its unpleasant side effects, particularly catapulting you into a new game phase when you were barely getting the procedure right in the first phase.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369524/#Comment_369524" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-27T17:54:03+00:00" title="March 27, 2012  5:54PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joel</cite>That, in fact, it was extremely striking to me how much in LARP, moreso than any other roleplaying form, everyone's experiences differ.

You may have a moment with one or two other people that most of the group simply doesn't witness, and that's just the way it works.</blockquote>\nSo much so that I wrote an entire article about it called <a href="http://www.mortalisrpg.com/?download=4" rel="nofollow">LARP is Simultaneous Action</a> (link goes to a page with a download button - I haven't figured out the direct link since Amber rearranged things) - simultaneous action meaning "multiple things happening at the same time, wherein a given participant only experiences a subset of them".<br/><br/>I think it's the most significant defining feature of larp - the thing that separates it as a medium of expression distinct from improvisational acting, tabletop roleplaying, and other related media.<br/><br/>Yes, some small larp-format games, such as jeepform games, consciously eschew that feature. But that doesn't remove it as a defining feature, just as when a Ken Burns documentary puts a still photo on the screen with music and voice behind it doesn't that movement on the screen isn't a defining feature that separates film from photography.<br/><br/>That being said, calling Shelter in Place a larp is kind of a disservice to larp as a form. I think it bears stronger resemblence to a playground game like Red Rover or Duck Duck Goose. It's basically Tag with a bunch of (apparently confusing) rules added on top.<br/><br/>That isn't to mean that I'm disparaging of action-oriented larp. I'm a big fan of the form. In fact, I used to run a game called ApocaLARP that was, primarily, a zombie larp (Though the zombie lethality was toned down significantly to allow for campaign play. And there were several other apocalypses happening at the same time.)<br/><br/>Foam sport games like Belegarth and Dagorhir don't typically self-identify as being larps. Nor to live combat larp players include them when they're talking about their hobby, most of the time.<br/><br/>I think that, similarly, Shelter in Place shouldn't really be grouped in with larp. It's much closer to something like <a href="http://humansvszombies.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://humansvszombies.org/</a>. Now that there's at least a couple of distinct and well known versions of such games, I think we could coin the term Zombie Tag Games to give them their own name (and keep them separate from larp, which is already muddled enough as it is, with a large distinction and player base splitting between live combat and non live combat styles).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369678/#Comment_369678" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-28T10:09:01+00:00" title="March 28, 2012 10:09AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: mease19</cite>Has anyone had a chance to play multiple games with the same group?

Doesn't seem like it played out that way in these stories though. Playing at night seems like it would help break up the obvious strategies of staying together since the humans would have a harder time connecting and coordinating with one another in the dark. I'm looking forward to getting to play SIP, and when I do, I will be sure to set time aside for a full run-down of the rules for both humans &amp; zombies, before play. <br/><br/>Zombie Tag Games, I can see that. I'd like to hear more about the Fantasy Capture the Flag as well. It also seems a lot like a Horde Larp, though with very minimal Horde characters. <br/><br/>Horde larps seem like a source of inspiration that might address some of the issues here. There are many run at InterCon in Massachusetts.  They require more set up: there is a set cast of continuing characters and a larger set of players who get rotating roles that have built in conflict with one another as well as the continuous cast.  I prefer to play horde, since it means playing a string of crazy characters with ever changing dynamics and roles that are played off against other people who are primed with characters to connect with yours. Timing can be off, since you are "released" back into the mix with your new character in hand, and you can miss your plot connections. But if you get bored, you can just jettison that character and get a new one.<br/><br/>There are generally very simple mechanics (if any)--comparing values on a single playing card, having an obvious power that you invoke by showing a card that describes it to the other player. Mostly play consists of playing the roles and making havoc for one another. Lots of running around. Lots of adrenaline. Here is the website for Collision Imminent, a sci-fi version of the Titannic sinking:<br/><br/><a href="http://home.comcast.net/~diewald/collision/CollisionImminent.html" rel="nofollow">http://home.comcast.net/~diewald/collision/CollisionImminent.html</a><br/><br/>The continuing characters in this game are the crew:<br/><a href="http://home.comcast.net/~diewald/collision/CICrew.html" rel="nofollow">http://home.comcast.net/~diewald/collision/CICrew.html</a><br/><br/>I can understand why counting was used in Shelter. It's an easy activity that anyone can do, with no special equipment. Joel, did the counting get you down as well? Zombies are meant to put pressure on the humans, so have less to play off and do. Counting might end up taking up much more of your time when you're undead since, your main agenda is just to eat the humans. Humans have more things to think about, and are worrying about the undead. If you can access the character. Bullet pointing the block of text might have made your second half more fun, jackson.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369749/#Comment_369749" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-28T13:03:28+00:00" title="March 28, 2012  1:03PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, the counting got me down a BIT, but by that point I was already on a "get in character high" from the initial shelter interaction, so I was more resilient to it.<br/><br/>The thing with the counting that consistently tripped me and others up was keeping the different counting phases straight. The "1-2-3-combat", then the 1 to 10 eating phase, plus an ADDITIONAL 1-2-3-Combat if humans come to the eatee's rescue, got everyone's brains (haha) all mixed up. And the three-count is SUPPOSED to be a signal for anyone who wants in to join, and the victim is supposed to freeze (and presumably yell for help) for the duration.

I have this idea that there are many people in the "kick it (the half-baked product) out the door" school, trusting facilitators to do the rest of the design &amp; pedagogy work on their game. I mean, they've <i>published</i> their game. This should mean that they're done with it for now, right?<br/><br/>b) I'm more interested in what will come of these specific people (in the thread) having played this game, what new designs will spiral out of their dissatisfaction. Ergo, we dissect the dissatisfaction &amp; then after make new things. My new things are looking cool, btw.<br/><br/>c) I assume that Shelter in Place has an audience out there, somewhere, which it's already engaged with - maybe i'm incorrect in that. I'm not part of its ideal audience, so i didn't "get it". I'm too fussy, i'm too demanding, whatever.<br/><br/>d) I think it's good for us to learn how to critique things as a community. An apology to those who were shocked by this approach; we'll smooth it out as we get better at talking about troublesome things. <br/><br/>e) man, if i'd've gotten an opportunity to read about where other people had expectations that weren't met with other gaming products before i bought them... that would've cut down on the disappointment over the years, for sure. Managing expectations can be challenging. Transparency can be challenging - sometimes we wish our "thing" could be everything to everyone.

This has the drawback that if someone has a special talent that causes some kind of quirky effect capable of twisting the storyline, the suspense of this character's storyline is muted. Everyone knows what this character will end up doing, so it becomes less a case of "What will happen?" and more a case of "When will it happen?".<br/><br/>The second is using multiple GMs/Moderators. These are not quasi-players who run around playing NPCS to push the storyline, these are purely moderators at the beck and call of the players for mechanic resolution. The recommended ratio is one moderator per five players, plus a lead moderator; a twenty player game ends up with five moderators. Personally, for this sort of game I use 1990's technology; two way radio headsets. I've got about eight of them on the same frequency for really big games. They allow the moderators to keep in regular contact, explaining changes to the setting across the team very quickly (without the need to physically move together and lock up the players access to moderation staff).<br/><br/>A lot of lead GMs don't like having team of assistant GMs or a moderation staff, because it takes some of the control out of their hands. But in this sort of game, I consider it mandatory.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_370302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370302/#Comment_370302" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-31T15:09:11+00:00" title="March 31, 2012  3:09PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This place needs more thoughtful critique, don't you think?  <br/>Story Games is about games, not solely about game design or game advocacy, right?<br/>We write about larger marketed games critically, why not smaller marketed games too?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>an instance of playing [Shelter in Place] was dissapointing. - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16200/an-instance-of-playing-shelter-in-place-was-dissapointing/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="an instance of playing [Shelter in Place] was dissapointing. - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16200/an-instance-of-playing-shelter-in-place-was-dissapointing/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content='I like the word "critique".

Why a public conversation, rather than a private note to the designer or publisher? What was the conversation that led to the decision (implicit or explicit) to criticize?

Criticism is part of how i take things apart to understand them better. I am most often critical. I sometimes start conversations to critique things, or even to criticize things. Maybe it's not roundly a good thing to do, but i do it. <br/><br/>question two: because i wanted to unpack my experiences in a way that would provoke my thought and the thought of my contemporaries. I don't know the designer. why would she / they want to get a note from me? Who am i to them? But more importantly: i am not, de facto, invested in this designer's trajectory with this project. I want a conversation w/ <i>these</i> people.<br/><br/>Paraphrase: "That was ok, but it didn't do <i>this</i>." "Yeah, or <i>this</i>." "I wanted to have had <i>this</i> experience" "I expected <i>this</i> other experience." "Let's make games that make us do what we want to do." also, from me: "I have emotions about the experience i just had." hint: rhymes with 'mission ointment.'<br/><br/>I don't see the last question as being important.<br/><br/><br/>Jason, it's ok for these people to be riffing off of stuff. the OP includes people who've heard about SIP. <br/>It's possible that my sense of scale is out of whack, but i don't think this is a very important thread. By that i mean, i don't think it will have an effect on the game's, you know, prospective profits or whatever metric we're going by here. <br/>Also: what did you mean about "prompting situation"? Why i instigated this critique thread on SG?<br/><br/>re: including SIP's author in the conversation, <br/>i mean, i'm just talking about my experience here. My goal is to make new designs which riff of our shared experience. There are lots of games which i don't connect with.

(The question is, "Who said what to whom?") Let's dig into that a little! <br/><br/>What I wonder is: why would you not answer that question? Well, one reason is: it's easier to criticise anonymously. <br/><br/>My main problem with this thread is that you're trying to set yourself up as neutral, dispassionate, independent observers. And you're not. You're a bunch of people who talked about a game, decided you disliked it and tacitly decided to criticize it publicly.<br/><br/>Would you have decided to attack this game if JR published here regularly? Would you have decided to do so if Brennen had self-published it? Or if JR had self-published it? I think it's much less likely.<br/><br/>All in all, I'd like a little more transparency and a little less pretended neutrality. If you had a conversation and decided to criticise, then let's hear about that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_370394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370394/#Comment_370394" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-01T05:55:48+00:00" title="April  1, 2012  5:55AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>Stop setting yourself up as neutral observers, benevolently criticising the game for the sake of Game Design.</blockquote>\nI like striving for ideals like this. Self-restraint is what keeps barbarism at bay. Even if we realize that the internal truth of human motivations is not ever pure, we can still treat other people's contributions in the spirit of purity, and we can do our best to be objective and benevolent ourselves. You or I do not need to know why a person chooses to share his experiences and analysis of a game; we are, in fact, obligated by courtesy to assume that they're being essentially honest when they tell us that their motivation is academic curiousity.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, I enjoyed the initial description of the game. I haven't heard of this game before, and that description gave me a good idea of what it's like, warts and all. I wouldn't even have thought the level of criticism remarkable were it not for Graham raising the question of whether it's appropriate to have these types of discussions in public. Graham has a good point in that the players participating in a session are not independent observers of a game text per se, even as they are reliable witnesses on that particular session of play. I don't think that this was particularly obscured by anybody, though - I understood from the initial discourse that the people telling about the game were mostly participants of that one game session, so of course their stories would resemble each other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_370404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F" title="Alex F"><img alt="Alex F" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/746/n1IV3AA06DPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F">Alex F</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370404/#Comment_370404" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-01T07:47:39+00:00" title="April  1, 2012  7:47AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, it's tricky. On the one hand, I think it's useful not to lose total sight of the social/motivation stuff that fuels what comes out of people's mouths (keyboards). On the other, once you start demanding we pay attention to social/vested interests, where does it stop? <br/><br/>Or to put it another way, where we decide that it stops has power consequences. So for instance, in this thread, we could now be asking Graham why he decided to critique the critique. Do those reasons include non-neutral ones that are not purely benevolent, and if so why weren't they flagged? And for that matter, why did Alex just post this inquiry into the critique of the critique? What were his motivations? All said, when you hold the torch revealing the motivations behind other people's words and deeds, you tend to keep your own out of that spotlight.<br/><br/>I personally feel uncomfortable with pulling out that torch at all, unless I think there are reasons to think there is clear bad faith going on (like deliberate deceit, or a recurrent vendetta). Absent that, I'm with Eero - I'd prefer to take people at face value as much as possible, although we could ask them good faith questions- "you guys are clearly friends, did you find that these things bugged you more when you shared them together? When you look back now, were there moments of fun you had?". But I would do that from a shared perspective - I'm looking to find out the truth <i>as well as them</i>, not in spite of them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_370446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370446/#Comment_370446" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-01T11:37:51+00:00" title="April  1, 2012 11:37AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite> <br/>Would you have decided to attack this game if JR published here regularly?

The critique in this thread pertains just as much to Harry, the event's facilitator, as it does to the author of the game.  Ross specifically states "I feel like my negative experience came from the implementation of the ruleset in the Gamestorm environment."<br/><br/>Harry is a regular here at story-games, a regular at Pacific Northwest gaming events, and a real sweetheart of a guy.  He put a ton of work into the Gamestorm SIP event, getting us a ballroom during a hot timeslot, setting up a big tent, labeling props with game rules, etc.  He had a lot invested in this game!<br/><br/>If the accusation you are making is true -- that community people are treated with kid gloves while outsiders are kicked around freely -- then this thread wouldn't exist at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_370457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370457/#Comment_370457" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-01T12:37:56+00:00" title="April  1, 2012 12:37PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The initial post and thread title aren't criticizing Harry. <br/><br/>Harry (to his credit) is the person mainly criticizing himself. Till Harry posted the previous posts seem (stress seem, this may have not been their intent) to try to move criticism away from Harry and towards the game itself. <br/><br/>Which is understandable, most people don't want to hurt their friend's feelings. But it shows how people we know get the benefit of the doubt while the game itself was being game design criticized in the middle of play (which to be fair, my friends who do this do this to everyone, regardless of who they are and I suspect that's the case here as well). <br/><br/>That said, I'm not trying to take sides. I just don't agree that Harry is being criticized the way or the amount that Shelter In Place is being criticized. <br/><br/><br/>I also want to underline that while I don't know Ross, he seems like a smart and very nice person to me from reading his posts. I look forward to gaming with him one day!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_370462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370462/#Comment_370462" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-01T12:57:52+00:00" title="April  1, 2012 12:57PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a data point I suppose, to anyone (okay, maybe just me) that knows nothing about Shelter in Place, the designer, the facilitator, and has never met any of the people posting about their play, well, there was zero angst or aggression in this thread. That stuff didn't appear until other people started posting about how this thread offends them. Until then it read like just some people sharing their experience of play and how that might be improved upon or what lessons could be taken from it.<br/><br/>Suggestions that read like everyone should bear ultimate responsibility for how other people interpret their words are disturbing, at best.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_370475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370475/#Comment_370475" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-01T14:43:55+00:00" title="April  1, 2012  2:43PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So there's even more weird fallout from this thread on G+ (and I totally agree with Jackson, the fallout has been totally out of proportion with how important this thread is [not very] or how significant a single mediocre session of play under non-ideal conditions is [not very]). I posted this there and I think maybe it can help the conversation here as well.  Here's hoping:\n<blockquote>So it's weird, right. I played in that game session and it really didn't work. Saying that it really didn't work -- in that instance -- isn't some assault on JR at all, or really an assault on her game. We didn't decide, in some hotel bar, to criticize the game on the internet. Jackson just posted his experiences and everybody else who felt the same way responded as such, with Johnzo noting that his experience was pretty different. If it looks like a pile-on, that's an emergent property of the way the thread came together, not anything coordinated.<br/><br/>If JR was a regular on SG, it might have happened slightly differently. Like "Hey JR: we tried to play your game and it really didn't work. Here's our experience. Was there anything we should have done differently?" But my sense is that nobody really expected a direct response from the creators, so we just went about dissecting the game on our own, trying to figure out why our experience was mediocre.<br/><br/>Personally, I'm still super glad JR wrote Shelter In Place AND that we tried to play it at Gamestorm, however successful that was. I really wish there were more "box larps" out there that made it easy for folks with little experience to easily try out live action play. And I'm not any less likely to try a box larp or support JR's future games because of one mediocre experience. I probably wouldn't play SIP again with a random group of mostly inexperienced non-larpers, but I'd happily play it with folks who'd run it successfully before. So, really, positive experience all around.<br/><br/>The only negative part, for me, has been all the painful self-reflection and speculation about ulterior motives. It was a mediocre game session! Maybe we didn't play it under ideal conditions or aren't really the target audience. There's no reason to pass blame around. But there's also no reason to feel guilty about talking about the mediocre experience and trying to understand it, as long as people keep some perspective. The negative comments in that thread from people who didn't participate in the game at all definitely didn't help either.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_370479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370479/#Comment_370479" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-01T14:50:05+00:00" title="April  1, 2012  2:50PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Totally spot-on, Jonathan.

If U B trollin'... cut that shit out.<br/><br/>Alex: word.<br/>Eero: word.<br/>Jonathan's x-post from G+: word.<br/>Chris: that's good to know. It certainly has gotten meta, as Alex said.<br/><br/>John (jenskot): You're right. My initial post is much more concerned with how Harry would take this, emotionally, than JR. It was through the conversation of this thread (which, as stated, was a continuation of post-game in person conversations) that i was shown how each of The Game, The Presentation, The Location, The Players, and My Own Prejudices shaped the play experience. Funny, right? That i would forget that all of these things factor so heavily in. But that's what the conversation is for!<br/><br/>Also, three points for clarity: <br/><br/>I will not name names so that others can antagonize them, period, ever. <br/><br/>The instance of play did not stop for some of us to begin our critique - more like a sideways "this seems weird" as we shamble by one another. This was all a while ago now, but i don't think i really started processing the experience until after play. (which is, y'know, good.) Maybe others had convos in the middle, i dunno.<br/><br/>Since the convo in person wasn't enough, we decided to have a convo here, in the main internet place where several of us converse about story games. (we: i started it, others joined autonomously.) Sorry that the overhearing of it got weird. I've certainly got nothing against JR - I don't even know her.<br/><br/><br/>I've changed the title of this thread slightly to make it less melodramatic &amp; angle it towards the footnote status it's destined for.<br/><br/>Yay box larps! I'm totally stoked on reading the Solmukohta book now, and figuring out what i want from this crazy medium. Though i've enjoyed a touch of Jeepform, SIP holds the spot as my "Heroes Unlimited": it has let me glimpse what is possible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_371043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371043/#Comment_371043" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-03T18:44:14+00:00" title="April  3, 2012  6:44PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you want to check out some of what is possible with predesigned larp games, an excellent starting point is Mike Young's site.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.interactivitiesink.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.interactivitiesink.com/</a><br/><br/>He has several games up there for free download. Lots of good stuff to read.<br/><br/>For a sort of transitional experience, check out Trapped, which is about 4 people stuck in an elevator. It's a little like playing out a Fiasco playset as a larp.<br/><br/>For an AMAZING example of a medium-sized (20 players, if I recall correctly) solid pregen (2 page character writeup, plus more handouts) game, check out The Final Voyage Of The Mary Celeste. **Spoiler Alert** Don't read it if you wan't to play it, though. Lots of awesome stuff in there that it's better if you don't know going in as a player.<br/><br/>And if you want to check out how the medium can be pushed, check out The Road Not Taken, which has been used in college classrooms for serious study stuff (which isn't to say it isn't a fun game, it totally is).<br/><br/>Oh, and if you want lowbrow satirical humor, check out Slash.<br/><br/>And there's other awesome stuff there too. Like a larp game designed to be run in a swimming pool. The players are fish in an aquarium.
