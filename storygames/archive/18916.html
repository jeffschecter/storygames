I'm Ben Costa. I make a comic called <a href="http://shilongpang.com" rel="nofollow">Pang, The Wandering Shaolin Monk</a>. And now I'm making a game based on it. I'm hoping to get some feedback.<br/><br/>It's a D6 dice pool system with skills and classes, and the game is set in 17th century China during a real time period. There's no magic kung fu powers, just abilities based on historical kung fu styles. Aside from combat stuff, the player is afforded a bit of narrative authority through their abilities as well. <br/><br/>I would love for people to actually play the game, but even if you just checked out the PDF and gave your thoughts, that would be fantastic.

Re: the character sheet, I guess I figured people would write those type of things on a separate piece of paper. There's a bit about coming up with a goal at character creation on page 62, under Fleshing Out Your Character. I personally don't like it when a character sheet is more than one piece of paper, but I suppose I could make another sheet for the Five Elements on page 62. Aside from that, I guess I never really examined what the goal of the game is beyond existing and making stories with your friends in this setting.<br/><br/>Could you explain a little more about what you mean by a progress tracker for the Masteries? Do you mean as an abstract goal-oriented type of thing, or something with actual game mechanics? The way to literally progress your Masteries is actually by increasing your skills, because each Mastery is generally tied to a skill.<br/><br/>If you're able to muster any type of playtest that would be great--audio, written feedback, whatever is easiest for you.

This is just my opinion.<br/><br/>The first thing I evaluate game systems by is the character sheet.  My motto is "if it's not on the sheet, the players don't have time for it."<br/><br/>Also, I agree with your "keep it to a page" push as well.  I'm with you.<br/><br/>You've got some really good stuff in here, with players being able to author content, and some strategy to character advancement, and a game system that looks like it will flow off the page.  I love the encounter and travel tables, and this document has a lot of really cool art and good layout.<br/><br/>But.<br/><br/>If you put it in my hands, and asked me to play it, I would be stuck at character creation.  Without context, without a goal in mind, it would be hard for me to make a meaningful choice as to which character type to play.  They all seem more reactive than proactive.  From this reading, I can't get a good feel of what impact my character would have on the fiction.<br/><br/>If I don't have a goal in mind, if I don't have a thing I feel like I need to do, then how is the game master going to offer me meaningful choices or targeted compromise opportunities?  If my character sheet tells me (and everyone else at the table) that I'm currently "searching for the man with the green lotus on his wrist" then we have some ground to work from.  The GM can plan to incorporate some shred of evidence, or some gossip about his whereabouts to keep things juicy.<br/><br/>And they must be Player Authored, in case I didn't make that clear.  This must be created by an interested player, not handed to them by fate.<br/><br/>What happens if the building is burning down, and there are valuable scrolls threatened by the flames, except now I finally see him, running from the fire!  What do I do?  Which will I choose?<br/><br/>Yes, this kind of thing can happen organically, at the table.  And people who know each other really well can do this to each other with almost no thought or effort.  But it's much easier with things written down.  It's easier to remember and reincorporate, easier to keep focus.<br/><br/>The thing about Mastery tracking, I'm borrowing from another system.  There, you had to purchase things with points, and you were given different awards each night.  A typical example would be a 4,3 2, and a 1.  So you would have to put 4 points towards some advancement, three towards a different advancement, and so on.  There was a tracking system.  "Oh man, just one more session until I get Tremendous Horse-Cut Technique."<br/><br/>And, more importantly, it let us incorporate that in to the fiction.  "You almost have enough points to learn that technique, so next session I'll make sure you encounter a master or a school where you can learn it.  And I'll make sure to incorporate that school into the current villain's schemes, to keep things interesting.  He'll learn more about you, let's see if you learn more about him too."<br/><br/>.. ..<br/><br/>We didn't get to a playtest this weekend, which is not unexpected.  I'll keep trying, and I've got some opportunities in the next few weeks.  If I get an online playtest going, would you be interested in observing (during or after)?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bencosta" title="bencosta"><img alt="bencosta" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bencosta">bencosta</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423274/#Comment_423274" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-22T01:38:34+00:00" title="October 22, 2013  1:38AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Harlequin. I think what you're saying rings true. I guess I'm coming from a position where I know the story of my comic so well, its characters and the conflict of the time period is clear in my mind, but maybe not so much on the page if you don't have the context or background. It's easy to fall into the trap that people will just immediately pick up on things.<br/><br/>I'll definitely look at making this a more prominent and essential part of character creation. And maybe further hone the class descriptions to elucidate how these characters might impact the fiction. From my own playtests, an interesting thing was that literally every player I've played with wanted to be a Folk Fighter after I described each class to them. I described the Folk Fighter as the token hero of a kung fu movie, just a normal dude with kung fu skills like Jackie Chan. Ironically, it's the class that I was having the most trouble designing because there's really no one like that in my comic. <br/><br/>While I like and appreciate the organic roleplay opportunities that Mastery tracking might encourage, I guess I'm going for something else with Masteries. The fiction kind of assumes that your character probably already knows how to use all of these styles etc., but when you opt to take a Mastery, that signifies that you've reached a point where it actually impacts gameplay in a new way.<br/><br/>If I'm available at the time you might get a game going, that'd be great to observe, otherwise, yeah, after would be cool too however that would work.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423280/#Comment_423280" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-22T06:22:08+00:00" title="October 22, 2013  6:22AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see what you mean with the Masteries, now that you say that.  But it wasn't something I got from reading it.  I'll try to make that clear when I get to a playtest table.  I see how character advancement is spelled out in the document as well, and it makes sense in retrospect.  The one thing I would (personally) change (and it's just me, again) is to emphasize time passing somehow.  Remind the GM and the players that these new Masteries take training (daily) or encourage the GM and players to have a break of a week or two (in the fiction) between sessions to allow the characters to have these breakthroughs in their training.<br/><br/>Plus I'm a fan of time passing, so birthdays, and seasons, and weddings, and forced marches, and political schemes can happen.  Your character can't stay 17 forever.<br/><br/>(This issue could already be addressed in there, I'll admit.  I've only had two light readings so far, and I'll compare notes with other players to see what they got out of the document as well.)<br/><br/>I'd be interested to see how people pick characters after adding in some suggested "starting" goals for them to choose from.  Maybe with some ideas, they would gravitate towards the other classes (or maybe everyone just wants to play Jackie after all?).<br/><br/>It looks like I have some people for this Thursday night (the 24th). I can record and post to youtube, no trouble at all (assuming I get consent on the night of).  I've pointed them towards the playtest document, the webcomic, and nothing else.

I guess I'm not that interested in quantifying time all that much as a player or GM, really, so forcing it into the rules isn't so important to me. To be honest, I wanted the Masteries to be pretty abstract on all levels. It's explained on a couple pages before all the Classes. Because you're right, it doesn't "make sense" that characters would be learning new stuff out of nowhere, but I also don't want to get bogged down in all of that either. I would hope, though, that if roleplaying your progression meant a lot to you, you could include that without a hitch.\n<blockquote><br/>It looks like I have some people for this Thursday night (the 24th). I can record and post to youtube, no trouble at all (assuming I get consent on the night of).  I've pointed them towards the playtest document, the webcomic, and nothing else.  Hopefully we'll uncover some holes for you.  I may have enough interest to get a second group next week sometime as well.  One never knows.</blockquote>\nThat would be really awesome.

I realized very quickly there are some things I should clarify or change.<br/><br/>\u2022  You have to put at least 1 point in each Virtue, and no more than 5. You can have 0D in a Skill but not a Virtue.<br/>\u2022  I'm thinking you shouldn't put any Gongfu Points into Skills at character creation anymore. The plus and minus 1D thing already seems to take enough time, and I've noticed people seem to actually get annoyed at the prospect of further modifying their skills.<br/>\u2022  I need to consolidate a better list of everything you need to do to make a character on page 4.<br/><br/>\u2022  The Karma Die is not an extra die. It's just one of your dice that you designate in a dice pool. If you have 1D, for instance, that's your Karma Die as well. <br/>\u2022  Aside from critical hits, the Karma Die doesn't do anything else in combat. My thinking was that I didn't want to bog down the pace since there's a 1 in 6 chance that something good or bad will happen, and you roll a lot in combat. But if you want critical misses to be a thing, maybe when you roll a 1, if you roll the die again and get another 1, some complication occurs. <br/> <br/>\u2022  Obviously, there's gray area and perhaps some overlap between some of the social skills. But I'm not sure if I think that's a problem. The difference between Bureaucracy and Enlightenment seems pretty clear to me (not sure if that was the comparison you guys meant). Normally you might get Bluff vs. Diplomacy in a game, but a pure "lying" skill didn't really fit with the Virtues, so I went with Charm/Diplomacy. The way you explained it at the beginning of the session is how I envisioned it. I can see where litigious players might get frustrated, but I don't know that I care too much :P <br/>\u2022  Making an opposed check is explained on page 3. Is it unclear? In that situation where the priest was trying to discreetly talks to the PCs, you could have had them roll off against you. Count the Successes, and if it's a tie, count the numerals on the Successes, and if that's a tie count the whole thing. Heart is usually the skill you use when someone is trying to use a social skill against you, but it could make more sense to use Perception in that case, or even Inspect.<br/><br/>\u2022  Regarding the Ax Mastery thing, it's probably not clear anywhere in the rules, but in general you are supposed to declare your intention to use something before you roll, unless the rules state that you can use it after you roll. So for the Ax, you'd have to say I'm going to use my Ax Mastery, and then if you got two successive 4's on your Karma Die, you'd critically hit. That might seem harsh in terms of usage, as its once per session, but you can use a Qi Die to do it again. <br/><br/>\u2022  As a note, I would suggest for you guys to use more Qi Dice! That way you don't have to be stingy with your abilities, or you can more likely hit an important roll. <br/><br/>\u2022  In combat, I totally get that it would have been difficult to play as described in the book, since there wasn't any visual tracking of the goons' wu shu dice, and you were rolling dice for one of the players. But I personally think it adds a bunch to the combat if you track things for each individual enemy, rather than one giant pool. It makes everyone's choices more consequential.<br/><br/>Also, I enjoyed how you described the scenes in terms of a comic book, and panel layout, etc. That was a nice touch. It was really fun to watch you guys play!<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423370/#Comment_423370" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-25T11:42:16+00:00" title="October 25, 2013 11:42AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 25, 2013 11:47AM by Harlequin.">edited October 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm sure most of our issues would be resolved on a second read through, but I figured it would be informative to see us stumble through it as we did.  I don't think the way you just described "AX Mastery" is underpowered, per se.  I'd have to see more combat to say for certain.<br/><br/>I did feel like we didn't use Qi nearly enough.<br/><br/>I'll track goons individually tonight, as we should be at the same table and it will be easier to do so.<br/><br/>Glad you got something out of it.<br/><br/>Re: Gongfu at Start, maybe let players keep the points, but start the session off without spending them.  If they think they need the extra die, let them spend them mid session to increase it, just for session one, to better align their expectations of their character with the reality of the scenario.  It may be too complicated to keep track if, but it's just what came to my mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lula" title="Lula"><img alt="Lula" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/409/n3KBYVIFT76IM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lula">Lula</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423412/#Comment_423412" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-27T17:54:12+00:00" title="October 27, 2013  5:54PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ben, I'm gonna be a little busy with the game I'm presenting at Metatopia until Metatopia's over next weekend, but I should be able to playtest the following week <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/> Can't wait!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bencosta" title="bencosta"><img alt="bencosta" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bencosta">bencosta</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423420/#Comment_423420" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-27T21:16:05+00:00" title="October 27, 2013  9:16PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent--Can't wait to get your feedback!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423472">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SteveDave" title="SteveDave"><img alt="SteveDave" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/267/nLSFO0MJD2Z0T.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SteveDave">SteveDave</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423472/#Comment_423472" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-28T19:49:40+00:00" title="October 28, 2013  7:49PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It was a pretty fun system, the art work and typography is better for your play test packet than a lot of final RPG manuals I have, and it has a nice sense of humor to it at places that really made reading the rules a bit fun.
