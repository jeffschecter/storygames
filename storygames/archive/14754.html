I've been interested lately in supers game engines and also more simple game systems that could be used to inspire or teach younger players.  Kids!  <br/><br/>Though, I am of full belief that in playing games with kids, you don't need to be overly simple to have fun,  to teach (a little),  to tell neat even complex stories,  or in any way "talk down to"  kids.  Thus... a game system focused on this type of more simple system CAN (even should!) be  ELEGANT  above all.  Enough for older players (parents and siblings)  to have fun with younger players as young as 3-4 years old and above.<br/><br/>One thought here I'm exploring is building a game that could be similar to the idea of  "reading/telling a story"  to kids as they go to bed - in place of the classic children's book before bedtime.  Or even around the campfire - in place of ghost stories.<br/>Additionally...<br/>I'd love to have the game be built with a  "campaign"  level style that older game players could pick up and have fun with,  perhaps building a campaign to mimic anything from  campaigns based on Grimm Fairy Tales  to  campaigns based on movies such as Toy Story or Small Soldiers, etc...   <br/>Or even just a fun elegant system for one-shot  "soda-n-pretzel"  gaming!  hehe<br/><br/><br/>Any thoughts on game systems or mechanics to start on?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335439/#Comment_335439" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-20T21:07:15+00:00" title="July 20, 2011  9:07PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, our most recent release, <a href="http://www.vsca.ca/Hollowpoint" rel="nofollow">Hollowpoint</a>, went through substantial playtesting with kids. Toph should be working up some notes for parents interested in following his footsteps soon. Worth noting that the game is about being extremely good at being bad and there is plenty of swearing in it. Naturally the kids adored it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335451/#Comment_335451" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-20T23:37:47+00:00" title="July 20, 2011 11:37PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Arg, there was this really cool, simple little system that was posted on Story Games (or linked to?) some years back. I think Josh Roby did it? I can't for the life of me find it. I played it with a coupla young kids and it was a blast. You overcome challenges by rolling dice, and then your dice go into a Boss Pool, and at the end of the scenario you face the boss. Something like that, anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335452/#Comment_335452" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-20T23:38:49+00:00" title="July 20, 2011 11:38PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 20, 2011 11:39PM by James_Mullen.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Try <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=12333&amp;page=1#Item_12" rel="nofollow">Doodlerama</a>: I play it often with kids where I work and it inspires some great story-telling, plus the drawing aspect means it stimulates more areas of the brain.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://danielsolisblog.blogspot.com/2009/08/happy-birthday-robot.html" rel="nofollow">Happy Birthday, Robot</a> is awesome and though I've not tried <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://danielsolisblog.blogspot.com/2007/08/do-pilgrims-of-flying-temple.html" rel="nofollow">Do: Pilgrims of the Flying Temple</a> yet, I imagine that it's awesome too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335463/#Comment_335463" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-21T02:42:21+00:00" title="July 21, 2011  2:42AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is something I've been thinking about with some work on a hack of my own FUBAR system...<br><br>I wanted a simple system that teaches kids that sometimes you can't get what you want and that makes things interesting....with the bonus that if you don;t get what you want up front, it becomes even more valuable when you do end up successful later on.<br/><br/>The tentative title for this kids version of FUBAR is "Oh No!".
