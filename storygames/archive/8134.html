Keep in mind that I'm pretty much a traditional GM with a hitherto mission-based approach to running sessions, so this is a deliberate attempt to change that.<br/><br/>I've found it enlightening so far, and I know several designers have modeled their games around it. However, I've been wondering what the limitations might be. Obviously, classic dramas aren't built with group collaboration and improvisation in mind; narrative structure assumes the story is the product of one strong voice. I also have doubts about any attempt to delineate play into distinct acts; I can't see anything but friction resulting if the GM is trying to keep things in the exposition stage when the players want to go stomp some foes <i>right now</i>.<br/><br/>So, has this worked for you, or is it an impractical approach? Also, what are some good texts or online resources I should refer to?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178993">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178993/#Comment_178993" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-17T10:38:41+00:00" title="November 17, 2008 10:38AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I try to do this using my own technique and table influence alone, it feels like I'm carrying a backpack full of lead.

For example: we've had an action scene, now let's rein the action in. That felt like the end of the first act: let's make the next bit like the start of the second act.<br/><br/>I think the danger comes if you're too strict. You identify this danger yourself, actually, when you talk about delineating play into three acts. There's a danger of railroading: it's time for the end of the First Act! Let's impose it on the players! No, guys, you have to do what I say, because it's time for the end of the First Act!<br/><br/>Um, I must politely mention that my book, <a href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/xcart/product.php?productid=16743&amp;cat=0&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">Play Unsafe</a>, talks a lot about narrative structure. It talks about creating stories on the fly: rather than fitting your play into a predetermined structure, there's things you can do to your play to make it feel like a story. Things like reincorporating elements from earlier in the story. Anyway, it's quite a good book, but then I would say that, wouldn't I?<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179000/#Comment_179000" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-17T11:47:24+00:00" title="November 17, 2008 11:47AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Contrary to Graham, who is a shameless tout for his own substandard merchandise, building in waypoints can work out pretty well.

It's like asking "Salt, how useful is it to cooking? How about water?" But I guess I shouldn't be surprised. It's extremely rare for a game, even a very story-oriented game, to give much attention to the structure of the story, let alone to recognize, even in highly formulaic genres and situations that formulae have been worked out over the many centuries for us to follow, that we want to follow, that we will, as story-readers and -hearers, naturally follow.  White Wolf started this off with discussions of Themes and Tones, two elements that are easy to incorporate because they are continuous across the life of a story.  It wasn't until the Requiem Chronicler's Guide that they started addressing character roles within the structure of a story as fitting into particular literary positions.  (The Opera version of Vampire: The Requiem is probably the clearest picture of this.)  Of course there's brain damage so nobody remembers that. <br/><br/>With Great Power did a smashing job of using the story arc of a comic book (or the pulp adventures and fantasies that underly comic books) in structuring the gameplay, but nobody has done much more in that direction.  Primetime Adventures mentions some aspects of TV show construction, but there's no mention of act-outs, laying pipe, turns, or anything in the story structure to know when you want to do something.  Baron Munchausen, while being thoroughly awesome, still manages to avoid virtually every structural tool that improvisational oral storytellers have developed over the years. Adamant did a great series of "adventure generators" that used a simple plot structure to generate random adventure hooks, but they were just hooks.<br/><br/>All this is complicated by the fact that literary structures of all sorts are routinely subverted, reversed, or suborned by creators who want the strength of the form under their feet but want to go in an unexpected direction.<br/><br/>Structure is crucial - hell, maybe structure is everything, I don't know, I'm not an expert.  And when I game I pretty much have to muddle along on my own with very little help when I think about the structure of the story in my game.<br/><br/>And that's my story-structure rant.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179009/#Comment_179009" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-17T12:36:21+00:00" title="November 17, 2008 12:36PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 17, 2008 12:37PM by Graham.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Morningstar does have a point.<br/><br/>It's also possible to talk to each other to coordinate story structure.

It's kind of like Premise/Theme: it comes out naturally when things are going well, because human beings are story-telling creatures.<br/><br/>In my experience, good story structure happens when there are bits in play that allow it to congeal, as opposed to mechanics that try to force it into being, much like Premise/Theme: better to let it emerge than to try to write it beforehand.<br/><br/>Strongly motivated characters, interesting situations, etc, all that stuff tends to do the trick more effectively and with less trouble. Players/people naturally create story structure when given the right tools!<br/><br/>That's been my experience. But I'm very open to other possibilities, so I hasten to add that it's only my experience so far.<br/><br/>Being aware of literary structure, though, is definitely helpful in design and in getting out of tough spots. Like, if the story you're creating doesn't "feel" right, or it's gotten into a dead end, sometimes looking at literary theory can help you figure out what the next step might be or where you've gone awry. Maybe it's kind of like RPG theory in that sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith" title="E.T.Smith"><img alt="E.T.Smith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1090/buddyicons/8542318@N07.jpg?1180909196"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith">E.T.Smith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179308/#Comment_179308" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-19T09:34:40+00:00" title="November 19, 2008  9:34AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 19, 2008 9:37AM by E.T.Smith.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JDCorley mentioned a lot of things that piqued my interest.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><i>Primetime Adventures</i> mentions some aspects of TV show construction, but there's no mention of <b>act-outs, laying pipe, turns</b>, or anything in the story structure to know when you want to do something.</blockquote>\nThe highlighted terms are new to me.

They often introduce, complicate, or resolve some issue.<br/><br/>Laying pipe is when characters do and say things that they have to do and say to set up a future scene or situation. It can be very clunky or very skillful.  "Boy, we sure are going to make a lot of money on this bake sale!" is not something anyone would ever say in real life.  It is the flipside of the normal TV/film writing adage that if it doesn't connect to an onscreen character, nobody will ever care about it - sometimes the onscreen character has to subordinate themselves to the structure of the show/film in order to set up a cool scene or situation later.<br/><br/>A "turn" is a very general term that can refer to a lot of things - when a situation has all the complications that it's going to have and it's all resolution from here, then it has "turned". A big new complication is also a "turn".   A character "turn" is a scene or action in which they display a hitherto un-emphasized or perhaps even previously un-revealed trait.  (It has connotations in wrestling that are much more specific than this and probably are a better place to start.)<br/><br/>For Baron Munchausen, the main omission that leaps out at me is re-incorporation - here's a game that is all about improvising and incorporating things people throw at you, but there's no reason to RE-incorporate something you or someone else has already said into the story, and that's probably the fundamental action of improvisational storytelling: keeping track of what's been incorporated and bringing it back and bringing it back and bringing it back.<br/><br/>Adamant's adventure generators were based on a very simple writing tool in which you basically use mad libs to create a one-sentence description of a short story plot.  SOMEONE goes SOMEWHERE to do SOMETHING but there's an OBSTACLE and VILLAIN is behind it all.  Randomly filling in the gaps gives you a basic outline, which is brilliant - but there's no attention in the adventure generator to how to introduce each of these elements to the game, in what order, and so forth.  I adapted some of this to an adventure generator for a MU* that I'm helping work on, <a href="http://www.random-generator.com/index.php?title=AoA_Adventure_Generator" rel="nofollow">which I then put on Abulafia</a>.

That is, by the end of the story everything that's been mentioned in it (be it a character, event or even just a background detail) has to have a clear relevance to something else in the story. No loose threads, no redundancies. The gun from act one has to be fired, the old man the Scooby gang hasn't seen since his brief introductory appearance will be the one under the mask.<br/><br/>The problem with this (and "laying pipe" as you describe it) is that it requires a self-referential awareness of the narrative, a conscious choice from all the participants of when to stop adding elements and start linking up and resolving them. I know that a lot of successful story-gaming happens in such a mode, but most of the players I interact with sneer at this as "metagaming".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179329/#Comment_179329" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-19T11:48:48+00:00" title="November 19, 2008 11:48AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right - I myself don't even know what "metagaming" is, everyone seems to have their own definition and any time it is brought up I tend to sneer and say nasty things about the person.<br/><br/>Awareness of story elements is perfectly okay in huge amounts of gaming - Aspects in FATE, for example, or a character's skills and capabilities, or their connections with other characters, those have been on character sheets for a long time and they are story elements. If a player (and here I include all players, including GMs) is interested in story as their goal in RPing, they are going to be aware of some story elements. Now it is true that not everyone likes every possible story element to be part of their story gaming. This stuff I'm ranting on about is no universal panacea. <br/><br/>There are people who consider the With Great Power story arc to be artificial and constricting. I consider it to be liberating and it makes my heart melt with love for the genre. It just annoys me that there's so few tools in my story-toolbox, there's so few clubs in my story-golf bag that relate to these sorts of things. "Laying pipe" may be a terrible element to incorporate into a TV-oriented game, but c'mon, let me decide that when I'm cooking up my campaign.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179330/#Comment_179330" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-19T11:51:02+00:00" title="November 19, 2008 11:51AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To add in: \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>That is, by the end of the story everything that's been mentioned in it (be it a character, event or even just a background detail) has to have a clear relevance to something else in the story.

That's the nature of the medium.  But re-incorporation is what ties the narrative together. I don't have to resolve (say) three different situations I introduce into my story IF the only purpose for them is to show off a character's generosity/badassness/loneliness/whatever. I've re-incorporated the element I need to re-incorporate, I can dump the rest of it without hurting the tale.<br/><br/>Maybe a story that tight is aspirational?
