Relevant background can be found at <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9995" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9995</a> in comments <a href="/forums/search?Search=%239&amp;Mode=like">#9</a>, 14, 20, 24, and 25.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>So, Michael, you ended your last comment with this:\n<blockquote>Something about the way skill challenges are described eats away at the very soul of role-playing and seems to turn what used to be role-played scenarios into a half hour of die rolling.</blockquote>\nCouple of things: <br/><br/>1.) So, as much as you don't like how skill challenges work out, can you imagine how much more they would suck if you were just sitting there for a half hour watching it? <br/><br/>2.) You're bringing that pesky roleplaying thing into it again. <br/><br/>I think your original criticism is out of scope for 4E, but I absolutely agree that it's a poor assumption to use in other games without designing for it. In something like Primetime Adventures, I actively would not want my character to contribute to every scene and every conflict, because I have certain expectations for the fiction - there's a lot of character development that you can't do when everyone's present, and the mechanics reinforce a shifting "screen time" emphasis among the protagonists.<br/><br/>But in PTA, the content that's produced in other people's scenes is interesting enough that I can be engaged as an audience member. It's fun to see how other people's characters are going to deal with their Issues, and I can still participate by giving Fan Mail and contributing dice to a conflict.<br/><br/>4E is precisely the opposite of that. All of the mechanical action of the game is geared toward a group of people working together to overcome an obstacle. You can either overcome an obstacle by playing a minis battle game or participating in a simple, round-robin dice game where you try and roll high a certain amount of times before you roll low a certain amount of times. <br/><br/>In either case, there's nothing really going on outside of the application of those mechanics to keep me interested - it's like watching two people play checkers or Yahtzee. You can't even really sync the fiction to the mechanics in a meaningful way - I mean, you're talking about a game where as a cleric, hitting someone in the head with a mace magically makes one of your buddies feel better... except it's not really you doing it, because it usually just means that they have permission to use a healing surge, which they spend. <br/><br/>There's *certainly* no human drama involved unless the group heavily drifts it into place; it's simply not a system where "free-play" roleplaying is encouraged or even necessarily desired, at least according to the structure that the rules put forward. So in that case, I absolutely <i>do</i> want to be able to participate in and contribute meaningfully to every encounter. If I can't, I'm going to sit there being bored to tears.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222514/#Comment_222514" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-04T16:21:27+00:00" title="August  4, 2009  4:21PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When people start talking about the soul heart or other magical things of roleplaying that cannot be seen heard or felt only described by someone who knows better than me, its gets my hackles raised. <br/><br/>That said, I've had skill challenges really fall flat and kill the buzz/roleplay. I would chalk this up to using a new tool and like using any new tool your bound to make some mistakes with it (what I learned, is that you shouldn't push skill challenges unless its like so important that the sun will consume the earth otherwise , this is something that If I had to guess something for the killing and maiming and gnashing of teeth, i would point to as its something that seems to go against the hackles of some(a lot, many?) of the assumed indie role playing guide that people are playing/designing from. but that's kinda of a really long aside at this point and can I just say chimichanga!)<br/><br/>Personally I think its really lame, when some douche with a fast mouth and no sense of taking their turn can literally overwealm a game with their gratitous ego, but what can i say, you win some you lose some...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/aeonite" title="aeonite"><img alt="aeonite" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.aeforge.com/~aeon/images/sg/myicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/aeonite">aeonite</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222527/#Comment_222527" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-04T16:57:25+00:00" title="August  4, 2009  4:57PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do I win a prize for getting my name in a topic?<br/><br/>Ultimately my issues with 4E are personal ones. And I accept that. Whatever the purpose of the mechanics, whatever the angle of the game itself (historically or otherwise), all I can go on, when discussing things like Skill Challenges and At Will Powers, is my experience with using them. <br/><br/>Prior to 4th Edition, I was never in a D&amp;D game - Basic, AD&amp;D, 2nd Ed, 3rd Ed, or 3.5e - where I felt that the mechanics were actively working to stifle role-playing. Whereas every one of 3 personal experiences with 4th Edition (and 2 anecdotal ones) has been quite the opposite. Rather than role-play, talk to NPCs, or strategize in combat, players now seem to simply play the same Powers in the same order (turning combat into a board game) and use the same skills in the same order in Skill Challenges, turning what used to be an opportunity for RP into a game of Yahtzee.<br/><br/>With 3.5, I've seen players sit by for a half hour or an hour waiting for their turn. I've been that player. And I was never once bored, because what was happening was interesting and moved the story along. With 4e I always have somethng to do, and that something is generally picking from a list and rolling a die. Sure, there's more I could do, and I do try to do those things. But the base mechanics, while solving one problem, cause another. And I prefer the previous problem.<br/><br/>Now, all that said...<br/><br/>I think an important piece of this is what the game itself is meant to replicate (as you suggest with the mention of PTA). 4th Edition is apparently not meant to replicate the Swords &amp; Sorcery Conan the Barbarian Fafhrd and Grey Mouser Lord of the Rings Thieves World Gord the Rogue style gameplay any more. It's meant to replicate some sort of Wushu Exalted-style heroism where everyone has awesome Powers right out of the gate. There's no character arc. The creators have said as much; to paraphrase, "a character is as interesting to play at 1st level as he is at 30th level; there's no more sweet spot." Well frankly I liked the sweet spots. I liked the imbalance. That's the sort of thing that drives narrative. Having weaknesses and overcoming them. Having a part in some situations but not others. Being the rogue who has to pick locks and dare poision needles instead of becoming a DPS monster. Being the cleric who has to carefully dole out healing spells instead of everyone having 87 Healing Surges to work with. <br/><br/>Imbalance breeds story. I don't want a game where going from level 1 to 10 to 30 changes absolutely nothing except all the numbers get bigger. I want a game where the wizard has to struggle to stay alive until he can cast fireball, and then he becomes something ELSE.<br/><br/>If LOTR had been based on 4th Edition Frodo would be smoking Ringwraiths all by himself at first level instead of suffering from a grievous wound through most of the story before barely succeeding only through the actions of someone else and then never recovering. Because the Ringwraiths would be scaled down to an appropriate level of difficulty. And afterward Frodo's player would get to pick the +1 item he wanted to receive from a wish list.<br/><br/>I like what was. I do not like what is. I loved Decks of Many Things and Girdles that changed your gender and wandering monster charts and save or die checks because it was the great unknown that made things interesting. I used to be HIGHLY engaged. In every 4E campaign I've been in, the players are on autopilot.<br/><br/>Previously, it was "You're in a maze. You can go any direction you want. Which way do you go?" and now it's more like "You're in a maze. Here's a map to the exit."<br/><br/>As to "heart and soul" and suchlikes, I'm not a drama queen romanticist and I tend to hyperbolize to make a point. RPGs aren't going to save the world from itself. I simply think that role-playing games have tended on an arc towards encouraging more role-playing - yes, I even include 3.5e in there - and I think that 4th Edition is a huge step back towards D&amp;D's wargaming roots, with more gaming and less open freeform "make stuff up" role-playing. And in that regard, it is less of a role-playing game than its predecessors.<br/><br/>You used the right word. Mechanical. Every version of D&amp;D has had mechanics, of course. Only in 4E do they feel mechanical to me. It's an artificial heart where there used to be something organic.<br/><br/>Insofar as D&amp;D is still the flagship for RPGs I think that's a travesty. It would be like selecting The Fast and The Furious to represent Hollywood in its entirety.<br/><br/>Insofar as it's D&amp;D and we all (mostly) know better than to expect more of it... c'est la vie.<br/><br/>These are just my opinions and I enjoy sharing them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222539/#Comment_222539" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-04T17:54:06+00:00" title="August  4, 2009  5:54PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: aeonite</cite>Previously, it was "You're in a maze.

That is like being told, "cleave, power attack and fireball are what you use, go to it".  It is disempowering for players.<br/><br/>I adapted the system to a "freeform the skill you're using to fit what narrative action you take to advance in situation".  We still only let 3 skills be Primary as a rule and have rules for freeforming it others as Opened etc.  I track what skills are used and people are not allowed to keep "going to the same ones as last time".<br/><br/>This has lead to more creative play and empowering PC's.  We've had the entire "dungeon crawl" free formed as skill challenge and gone straight to the "big fights".<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222546/#Comment_222546" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-04T18:26:15+00:00" title="August  4, 2009  6:26PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 4, 2009 6:30PM by Leonard Balsera.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            See, this is kind of interesting, because I've always found the attempt to add story stuff into D&amp;D vaguely annoying as a whole - like, I recognized that most groups I was in drifted their games that way because D&amp;D was what we had, not because D&amp;D was actually a proper tool for that job. I mean, in the beginning, the only reason why you had alignment at all was so you knew what was a valid target in the dungeon, right? It wasn't until a bit later that there was even any discussion about "inhabiting your character" in the sense that most folks tend to define roleplaying now, and it always seemed to me to detract from what I felt was a pretty tightly designed game about killing monsters and getting cool stuff. <br/><br/>Really, every version of D&amp;D has relied on heavy drift to do story - mechanically speaking, it's never been good at emulating any kind of fiction; D&amp;D is basically its own subgenre of fantasy. The main difference is that the previous editions can handle that kind of drift okay, and 4E really can't, from what I've experienced of it. For me, that's a good thing, precisely because I have tools like <i>In a Wicked Age</i> and PTA and PDQ and Fate when I'm interested in prioritizing the narrative in certain ways. And I have 4E when I want to kill monsters and get cool stuff. <br/><br/>I mean, honestly, I don't equate my experiences of either edition all that much - I find 3E and 4E to be wholly different activities, and I wouldn't try to interchange a campaign I'd run with one with the other. There are things I like and dislike about each. I'm happy to play both of them at different times. <br/><br/>And I get a vibe like I'm not the only one, given the success of Pathfinder's pre-order sales.<br/><br/>(Also, man, I'd have loved to see what your groups had going on with 3E fights that are interesting enough to wait an hour for your turn. Largely speaking, it bores the living hell out of me, and it's even worse when I finally get my turn and realize I have nothing significant to contribute.

Mike Mearls has a series of interesting articles up on DDI (in various issues of the online Dungeon IIRC, and I do wish it was all compiled somewhere) that really complete the Skill challenge rules from the DMG. At one point he brings up the idea of throwing the players free successes for really great ideas. Personally, being an old-school DM from the "tell me how you do it" school, I find it very hard not to just resort to this every time. And that's actually kind of disappointing, because there's all these rules that we all came to the table expecting would be important.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222573/#Comment_222573" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-04T20:04:28+00:00" title="August  4, 2009  8:04PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite><br/>If you like 3.5 more, can't you continue to play it?</blockquote>\nOn Mike's behalf (since he's not in, and since I personally talked to him about 4e vs other editions at Origins), he totally is doing the above: Playing the hell out of 3.5 and the like, with a mixed group of pirates, ruffians and competitive eaters.<br/><br/>I think the above conversation between Lenny and Mike stemmed on an interaction that was seeped in, "Hey what do you think about 4e"?

A pretty powerful one. We're not prepared for it, and neither is he, but we go with it. Now we're in completely unexpected and dramatic territory. This encounter was not totally balanced beforehand. We might very well die here. Unless we think through this and play our cards right. We've got a healer, a rogue/fighter, a scout and a mage. We talk through our plans and decide that the fighter is going to rush one and try to draw it onto him so the others can get to better positions because they can't handle a full on assault. The scout tries to stay mobile to get his damage bonus while the healer backs towards the river and the mage tries to plot a way to use an AOE spell that won't also incinerate me. It's my turn as the fighter but everyone else is chatting and involved in the strategy that's unfolding. Every round counts because a bad die roll could end one of us. Turns out that the encounter generated TWO creatures and one comes out of the river and tears the healer in half. Now we're in for it. But we manage to strategize and maneuver and take out two of the three baddies while the third takes off. Then we collect the remains of the dead cleric and return to town. We're in a shambles now, and our plans to go to the dungeon for treasure are for the moment dashed. We're humbled. We have to negotiate with the head cleric to raise our friend, and the expedition is now costing us money. Now we HAVE to go get that treasure because we're in debt. During that negotiation, I (the fighter) have little to contribute, but I don't feel bored that there's an RP narrative happening for a few minutes that doesn't involve me because the story still involves me.<br/><br/>Most of the above involves things that aren't hard-coded. The base d20 mechanic carries us through, but while we've got miniatures on the table there's no grid, just rough positions and estimates. The GM is winging a few things, and we're chattering and talking through the entire half hour fight. There is no need for mechanics to cover the cleric negotiations because the Role Playing handles that part. A few skill checks when appropriate come up, briefly resolved and then gone. Because of how things went down, we've got a story arc going now, an unexpected one that forces us to rethink the story and plan ahead. There's drama. That's how my 3.5 experiences have gone.<br/><br/>4e COULD do all that too, but you'd have to more explicitly be ignoring a whole bunch of the rules to do it the way we just did it. The way Powers work would have completely changed the way that encounter went. Instead of making up maneuvers and discussing strategy, I would have used a power and moved 5 squares, and then the scout would have used twin strike every single round, and the mage would have cast his daily and then an encounter and then fallen back on the same at will over and over, while the cleric healed us from afar. After the encounter, which we probably would have all survived, we would magically find exactly the +2 longbow that the ranger had been waiting for. We would each earn an action point and continue on our journey. The entire combat would take about as long, but there would be no creative decision making in there. Just power usage. Assuming the cleric still died somehow, the negotiation with the high priest would have been a skill challenge. My fighter would have repeatedly tried to intimidate him because that was his mathematically best skill. Because everything comes down to die results, the whole role-played discussion becomes meaningless. The game is pushing us to get it done and move on to the next dungeon room. That's how my 4e experiences have gone.<br/><br/>At this point in the argument, Page 42 usually comes up (see Simon's link, above). And that's all well and good that there's a page that tells you how to handle "everything else." But I haven't seen it used. Why? Because the players don't try to stunt in 4e. They have Power Cards and those are the most mathematically appropriate things to do for any given encounter. You COULD do anything you wanted, but why would you when you have a list of suggestions in front of you?<br/><br/>It could also be argued that 3.5e also required miniatures and a grid but that's patently untrue. Spells have ranges and AOEs given in feet. With that you can always freeform it and guesstimate things. 4e essentially requires that everyone in the world move in squares.<br/><br/>Heck, even in my 1st edition game we had more creative combat scenarios going on. The rogue climbed walls and dropped things on people's heads. The cleric took cover behind the mule. The mage ran out of spells and started throwing darts. We had to think on our feet using limited resources and there was an inherent power imbalance and an element of risk that just is not there (in my experience) in 4e.<br/><br/>I have been and remain constantly engaged in D&amp;D, in a manner I never was in 4e. YMMV, but that's the way I've seen it.<br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>If you like 3.5 more, can't you continue to play it?</blockquote>\nAs is clear from the above (and from Andy's note) I am in a 3.5 group and I'm in a 1e group that just swapped to C&amp;C. My preferences have driven my choice of game. I wanted to give 4e a few chances to make sure it wasn't just one GM or one group. It wasn't. However, I still reserve the right to critique a game system that I choose not to play any more. I don't see it as edition wars so much as it is arguing a point and discussing game design choices. I'd be more disappointed in myself if I just said "it sucks" and never bothered to explain myself. I completely understand the reasoning behind the 4e mechanics and as a game designer who hopes to put out ever-better games it's important that I do. I sat in a round table discussion with Rob Heinsoo where he discussed those very decisions. I get him. I get why things were done. I just don't agree with the choices.<br/><br/>So to loop this back around to the topic at hand: I feel that 4e's mechanics make me less engaged as a player precisely because they are more present and intrusive and obvious. Given specific options, I choose from those options, and because there are so few optimum choices, I can choose them on autopilot. I am anything but engaged. Maybe that wasn't how it was supposed to happen, but it's how I've experienced it.<br/><br/>I appreciate that others have had a different experience and I hope I get the chance to game with you guys some day so I can see it in action. Truly. It sounds like your 4e experiences are a lot like my 3.5 experiences and that sounds like a good deal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Levine" title="Daniel Levine"><img alt="Daniel Levine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Levine">Daniel Levine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222582/#Comment_222582" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-04T20:36:47+00:00" title="August  4, 2009  8:36PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing that's come up in this thread that I've seen in a number of criticisms of 4E are things in the neighborhood of "there's not as much challenge in 4E because encounters are all perfectly balanced."<br/><br/>As someone who's both played and GMed 4E (and, to come clean, likes it better than previous D&amp;D editions, but not as much as other games), I find this criticism confusing.

I keep hearing about these amazing 4E games and I keep looking for them. Someone will tell me their 4E game is fiction rich (meaning the fiction matters) and then the other players in the same group will tell me something different. And many of these people are very much fiction first players. At least in non 4E games. <br/><br/>3 weeks ago I walked around where 5 different 4E games were being played and if it wasn't someone turn, they weren't talking. And when it was their turn, they spent most of the time looking over options and ignoring the fiction. The only groups that seemed to put fiction first were completely ignoring many of 4Es rules and just winging it. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I like 4E's mechanics as a tactical game. I think it's excellent except for the game slowing down more and more as you go up in level. But from a fiction rich perspective, I feel like I'm missing something. And I've played and ran the hell out of it. And people who have played with me know I can bring it. I just don't get it. And I want to.

Every hard encounter just feels like it's meant to get me down to about 66% to 75% of my capabilities before we win, and because everyone has At Wills you never really get to a point where you're out of options and have to even consider fleeing. I've never been in a 4e group that thought to run away or parley with the enemy. As before, others have had different experiences. I have not. It feels like math, and it feels like I know the answers before I even begin the encounter.<br/><br/>I guess my argument would be that from my perspective it's too balanced now. Every roll essentially comes down to a 50/50 hit/miss chance (10-11 on a d20). Add bonuses? Well the monster AC went up by the same amount. Are you level 10? Well they're leveled up now too. The numbers get bigger Bigger BIGGER but at the end of the day it's still nothing but a d2 every time. It's balanced like Tic Tac Toe is balanced. If you're paying ANY SORT of attention and following the rules, you always draw.<br/><br/>I would rather run Tomb of Horrors a hundred times than run a perfectly balanced 4e module a single time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222592/#Comment_222592" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-04T21:15:24+00:00" title="August  4, 2009  9:15PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite><br/><br/>It's all about the boxes and clouds, John.</blockquote>\nThat's what I argue<a href="http://simoncarryer.blogspot.com/2009/06/4e-and-fictional-causes.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/>Great blog post!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222594/#Comment_222594" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-04T21:24:51+00:00" title="August  4, 2009  9:24PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 5, 2009 9:51AM by Valamir.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            4E is an amazing amazing amazing game.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts only marginally a role playing game.  Its more like Hero Quest (the board game) or Descent or Rune Bound...or hell Diablo for that matter.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut here's the thing.  For most of the world, "RPG" means "game where your character gains levels and gets new powerz".  All the stuff we think of as roleplaying...TOTALLY alien to the vast majority of people who play RPGs.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause by FAR more people are playing RPGs on a console or PC than around the table top.  And the only thing required to make a game an RPG is gaining new powerz from leveling up, and maybe some color text to read that tells you why you're killing these particular guys.  THAT'S what roleplaying means to most people.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's what 4E delivers in Spades.  4E is a PC / Console RPG brought to the table top.  It has all the design sensibilities of Diablo, or the old Lightning Force series from Sega.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that's a GOOD thing.  Because immersive roleplaying experiences with rich fiction...?

Here's an overall goal, and here are the success/failure conditions.  OK, now, here's an obstacle, and here's one possible way to overcome it.  But if you want to overcome it some other way, that's cool, but you have to make it make sense in the fiction.  Designate who is the primary roller and who is helping, and with what skills.  Helpers have to contribute to the fiction as well.  OK, now, here is the next part of the challenge.  Etc.<br><br>It's resulted in what I wanted, which is the characters doing things together as a team, in the fiction, that isn't killing stuff.  One of the players, who is himself a DM and provides me with all my minis and such, commented on how much he hates skill challenges, except that the way I run them is pretty cool.  Which made me feel good, but also kind of pissed that I basically *had* to dip into my "into games techniques" pool in order to make a central part of 4E cool.  (Although I don't feel I'm actually drifting the rules, per se, just clarifying some stuff that isn't there in the DMG.)<br><br>Because there are a lot of people who only play 4E, and that includes people who run 4E.  I'm really glad we've gotten away from the bullshit hierarchical GMs-as-nobility social model for play.  And the text of 4E is very egalitarian in a lot of important ways.  But my experience running 4E (as well as playing with DMs who are less skilled than I am, or have a less broad base of exposure to a variety of techniques) is making me think that to GM 4E really well, especially if you want to do more than set up cool fights and run them, you *do* have to have some special skills.<br><br>Now, I acquired those skills by playing and reading and running lots of other games.  But if you're like most gamers and only play 4E (and maybe you played its predecessors, ok, fine, whatever, nothing helpful there), you may indeed find that you need to be uniquely gifted to make the game run smoothly between combat encounters.  And that's kind of a shame, but it is a fixable problem.<br><br>Matt                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/aeonite" title="aeonite"><img alt="aeonite" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.aeforge.com/~aeon/images/sg/myicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/aeonite">aeonite</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222607/#Comment_222607" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-04T22:45:21+00:00" title="August  4, 2009 10:45PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>For most of the world, "RPG" means "game where you character gains levels and gets new powerz".</blockquote>\nYes, and this is what makes me a sad panda.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bryant" title="Bryant"><img alt="Bryant" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bryant">Bryant</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222642/#Comment_222642" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-05T05:01:31+00:00" title="August  5, 2009  5:01AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 5, 2009 5:02AM by Bryant.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heck, you have to have certain skills (I wouldn't call 'em special) to <i>play</i> 4e with story in mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me ask a question. Let's say you're playing PTA, and the fiction is about trying to escape a mysterious island. Do you feel compelled to always make choices which most directly get your PCs off the island, or do you make the choices which serve the narrative and which highlight the flaws, strengths, and personality of your PCs?<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's the money quote from this thread for me: "Given specific options, I choose from those options, and because there are so few optimum choices, I can choose them on autopilot." That's a valid way to play 4e and it's certainly a strategy that some people will enjoy while others won't. But you absolutely don't have to always make optimal decisions. I find, both as GM and player, that making dumb decisions improves the fiction during both combat and skill challenges.<br/>\n<br/>\nConcrete example time!<br/>\n<br/>\nI was running H2, and my party ran into this big lumbering automaton monster that was hard to hit, didn't hit too hard, and had a zillion hit points. I played the monster with all my tactical wiles. It was an intensely boring fight. The PCs took down the rest of the monsters in the encounter, then spent like six rounds hammering on the automaton. Yawn.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next time they ran into one of those, I remembered to avoid perfection, and the automaton acted without cunning. It provoked a lot of opportunity attacks, lurched towards whoever had last threatened its master, and so on. And wham: now it wasn't a token on the board, it was a part of the fiction. Through its actions, it reinforced the picture the PCs had formed of the master's plot. It wasn't an isolated thing, it was a dumb servant, and that made a ton of difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll note that this is not in any way an obvious skill, and I don't know of any D&amp;D; texts which teach it to you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222704/#Comment_222704" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-05T09:34:02+00:00" title="August  5, 2009  9:34AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike,<br><br>It sounds like you're bored with 4E because you feel you don't have to think very hard to find the optimal choice in any given situation. If I had to guess, you want to be challenged and you think the rules take the challenge away from you -- by making encounters predictably "easy" or by codifying powers in such a way that there's no thought required to pick the one you should be using. Am I reading you correctly?<br><br>In games where players really want to sweat and earn that next level, the DM needs to step up and make it hard. If you've never felt like your character was going to die, something isn't right. The DM should up the encounter level, set up encounters so that monsters can take advantage of terrain, and make things harder on you guys. Using more monsters instead of bigger monsters helps. There are clever ways to make you not want to use your most optimal power, too. When the best choice seems to be to use area attacks on minions, have the minions hold a weak (1 hit point) friendly NPC hostage. Put interesting skill challenges into the middle of combat encounters. For example, while the skeletons attack you, the room is filling up with water and you'll drown unless you can deactivate the trap.<br><br>Yes, page 42 and all that. Are you saying that all the most interesting options (as well as the most effective ones) are already printed on your sheet, so there's no reason to get creative? I don't buy that. At the very least, you could get a +2 on top of your optimal choice because you added a creative touch. <br><br>Maybe none of these things will fix 4E for you. Maybe you're not going to bother trying.

Am I reading you correctly?</blockquote>\nThe larger issue for me is that I feel the presence of MORE rules resulting in MORE balance is the wrong direction to go in general. I don't appreciate the hand-holding the system does, particularly when it won't let me run across the street dodging cars. It wants me to play it safe, wait for the light to change, and then walk between the two white lines to the other side. I can ignore that if I want, but that also means everyone else has to ignore it, and the DM has to ignore it, and at that point why play 4e if you're all ignoring the ways the system wants to play?<br><br>I completely understand the argument that D&amp;D4e is an RPG like Diablo or WOW is an RPG wherein you choose a class and race and run around bashing in skulls and using powers over and over whilst gaining experience and leveling up so you can bash in larger skulls and use different powers. I completely understand the case being made for making all classes more or less equal in some regard such that they all have some cool power to use at every mouse click cum round of combat. And to some degree I also understand creating a system wherein the powers are more balanced and mathematically optimized to the point where a novice can more or less figure out which powers to use during which phase of the combat.<br><br>And I likewise understand the argument being made that there are ways to circumvent that, but I don't think circumventing the system to get a desired outcome is saying great things about that system.<br><br>The fact remains (for me at least) that prior editions played notably differently. It felt like there was more choice, and that it was more encouraged. There was a notable imbalance to the classes which meant that you could pick the one that matched the play style you wanted to emulate. Are you a newbie? Play a fighter and learn the ropes, then maybe swap to wizard when you want the bookkeeping to handle too. There was no obvious framework to everything that happened outside of combat - you used a few quick skill checks here and there, but for the most part it was a big open world where the GM would have to come up with things on the fly, where narrative flowed and I feel creativity was more called for. There were fewer rules, and less obvious mathematical choice, and while (in 3.5 especially) there was plenty of room to min-max and play Diplomancers and whatnot, there was also a lot more room for story and creativity. Not only because it was encouraged, but because it was necessary.<br/><br/>Some say I'm crazy and that D&amp;D has never been like that, but it was for me, and has been since I got that Red Box set for Christmas in 1984. From the very start, I would tell people who asked that Dungeons &amp; Dragons was like a game in your head where you could do anything you wanted and there was really no winner at the end of the game session. "Why would you play a game you can't win?" they would ask. And I would just shake my head. They just wouldn't understand.<br/><br/>But I can't really say any of that about 4e without wincing. The game is necessarily played on a table now, not in your head. You can theoretically do anything you wanted, but the game encourages you (sometimes subtly, oft overtly) to use specific powers at specific times because they make the most mathematical sense. And frankly, you can win at D&amp;D now. Every little combat feels like a little "Ding" and a pat on the back. You get WIN POINTS for it. Powers reset. You can almost see the little POWER UP icons floating over the miniatures. The edges around encounters used to be hazier, and a dungeon (for me) never felt like a sequence of blocked-in encounters handled one at a time all in a row. The edges are sharper now, the goals clearer, the win states more obvious, and the paths to victory are brilliantly clear. And all of that SHOULD make for a better game, and I think as a GAME 4e is far superior. But none of those things, in my mind, improves upon what always made D&amp;D (and role-playing in general) so interesting to me. I never played it because it was a game; we had Monopoly and Sorry and Dark Tower if we wanted to play games. I never played it for the mechanics. I played it because it was D&amp;D. And now, for me, it's not any more. I used to be engaged, as a player and as a DM. Now I'm not.<br/><br/>Of course, D&amp;D has evolved. Basic D&amp;D was a crippled thing missing a leg. AD&amp;D added three arms and two polearms and cut off the other leg. 2nd Edition gave it legs but put them on backwards, and then added a few more arms which promptly fell off. 3rd Edition got the legs and arms figured out, but it added rocket launchers to the shoulders. But through all that, it was still the same core game. With 4e, it feels like D&amp;D was dragged out back and shot, and now there's an imposter wearing its skin.<br/><br/>Like you said, there are plenty of other gaming options, and I've chosen them. But I still think talking about 4e -- though I've probably given up on it for good -- is appropriate when it relates to specific issues (such as player engagement). Like I said, I didn't used to play D&amp;D for the mechanics, but for D&amp;D, and now I'm in the reverse position where I'm not playing D&amp;D because of the mechanics. And I think that's worth discussion, as a game design issue. I don't play Exalted any more either, but I'll be happy to discuss that game's ridiculous dice pools with you. And I'll never watch "Austin Powers in Goldmember" ever ever ever again, but if you bring it up in conversation I'll be sure to tell you why.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222749/#Comment_222749" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-05T11:31:39+00:00" title="August  5, 2009 11:31AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hrm. I don't think any of my suggestions circumvent the rules. I think they're stuff a DM is supposed to do, within the rules as given.<br/><br/>3E doesn't have fewer rules than 4E. It has more rules, because every class essentially has its own subsystem. It is worse in 2E and 1E. Play a fighter, learn the combat rules plus a few special fighter rules for your feats. Play a wizard or cleric, now you learn the spell rules. Play a rogue, and now you learn the sneaky-stealing rules. 4E rips the subsystems off the game and puts them back uniformly, and I think that's a huge issue some players have with the game. It doesn't feel like 3E because the classes all feel the same. But make no mistake: 4E has fewer rules than 3E. It just has more powers (3E called them feats, but they were powers, too).<br/><br/>I also debate that 3E play isn't as tactically diverse and interesting as 4E play. For one, skilled players have such optimal builds that there are killer combinations and stuff. There's generally only one thing to do in combat (roll to hit). At least 4E gives you different ways to attack and makes movement interesting (and more likely). The 4E DMG talks about how encounters aren't one-small-room things anymore, but crazy, organic sprawls over large areas of the dungeon. 3E was, for me, the kind of "enter a room, fight monsters, search for treasure, move to the next room" blocked-in encounter thing you say you dislike in 4E.<br/><br/>I totally believe you that 4E doesn't engage you like 3E does.

While the DMG might have some keen DM encounter-building advice, that's not nearly enough.  The sample DMG scenario and the modules should really, really <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">emphasize</span> demonstrate  fresh encounter design.  That kind of thing needs to be taught by example, not by instruction.  I really wish that Keep on the Shadowfell had been a showcase of the new possibilities of 4E.<br/><br/>I believe this is one of the big reasons we see a lot of vocal 3.5 enthusiasts not interested in upgrading.  I don't think previous versions of D&amp;D supported highly tactical play very well*.  And then 4E came along and rewarded very little but tactical play.  For that to work well, I believe the DM has to really bring a challenger mentality to the table (to make sure the outcome is doubtful enough to be engaging) and has to also be like a good video game level designer (so that play doesn't become repetitive or boring.)<br/><br/>Really, a huge part of my 4E DMing fun is the off-table lonely fun -- given mechanics, XP budget, terrain, and fictional considerations*, what is the <i>coolest damn thing</i> I can build?<br/><br/>Respect and honor, of course, to those for whom this is Not Fun.  <br/><br/>* I mean, in most D&amp;Ds you've got lots of fighty rules, but in my experience (and in aeonite's) things just work better when you selectively engage the rules and kinda wing everything else.  And that style of play doesn't work for me in pseudo-tactical or tactical play, because constantly validating my understanding of the SIS against everyone else's makes for inefficiency and mother-may-I? play -- or play that is not constrained meaningfully by the rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222835/#Comment_222835" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-05T15:13:42+00:00" title="August  5, 2009  3:13PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 5, 2009 6:05PM by johnzo.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>But from a fiction rich perspective, I feel like I'm missing something.</blockquote>\nI believe you can do fiction in 4E like in any other trad game, and I think the key is to never engage the heavy mechanics unless the outcome is relevant to the fiction.<br/><br/>The Riddle of Steel was the first game I encountered that really emphasized this.  It gave characters huge difference-making bonuses when they engaged their flags.  If your table played RoS like it was Diablo, with the DM setting 'em up and the players knocking 'em down, you were in for a very short and probably unfun game.  But if you prudently avoided meaningless strife and only really got your teeth in the game when the fiction demanded your character's interest ... well, suddenly, you're addressing premise and crap.  Player-created quests in 4E are a similar but much less potent push in that same direction.<br/><br/>I also think it's a good idea to adopt the Mouse Guard philosophy that (I understand) insists that mechanical failure should never stymie the fiction; instead, it should narrow possibilities or create entirely new forks.  TPKs are bad, story-wise, unless everyone is into the idea of their character dying or they're all amped up to do a ghost rpg or something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_223129">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223129/#Comment_223129" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-06T22:27:01+00:00" title="August  6, 2009 10:27PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jenskot (and others) \u2014 I ran an awesome skill challenge at the end of the session of 4E I DM'd earlier tonight.<br/><br/>The PCs had to rescue a group of Eladrin civilians who were trapped in a neighborhood overrun by Far Realm creatures.  These survivors include the family of one of the PCs, long ago exiled from the Eladrin city but now returned.  The tower they were holed up in was the last one standing in the district, and was at the edge of one of the floating disks that comprise the Eladrin city.<br/><br/>First, the PCs had to fight the besieging monsters, which wound up being quite a cool fight.  But, then the tower was collapsing!  Oh noes!  Get the civilians out safely before it does, or they will all die!<br/><br/>I started with five suggestions for them, and said that many of the options presented would have hard DC's (but that would net them two successes, which I admit is a bit of a house rule but I think a damn good one).  Others had moderate DC's.  In addition to taking some of my suggestions, the players got really creative, both with primary and helping rolls.  Successes <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a> and 5 (out of 6; it was Complexity 3) came from the Dwarven Warden <i>setting up ziplines</i>, using the Tiefling Warlock's climbing kit, to move some of the survivors from the collapsing building onto a nearby building that was damaged but not destroyed.  And the final success came when the Warlock used her Bluff skill to lie to the Eladrin children, the final group trapped, about how it really wasn't that bad, the fire wasn't that hot, the shards of crystal weren't that sharp, etc.<br/><br/>That last example is interesting because Bluff is far and away the Warlock's best skill, and she does use it quite a bit in skill challenges, but it doesn't feel munchkin-y or inappropriate because she can always make it work in the roleplay.  And in fact, I think in this case in particular it actually strengthened the fiction\u2014by <i>lying</i> to the children about how the situation "isn't really that bad," she was in fact establishing just how dangerous the situation actually was.<br/><br/>The fight took awhile, of course, though not excessively so, but the Skill Challenge took about 10 minutes.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_223187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223187/#Comment_223187" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-07T09:12:07+00:00" title="August  7, 2009  9:12AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite>(but that would net them two successes, which I admit is a bit of a house rule but I think a damn good one).</blockquote>\nFor what it's worth, I don't think there's too much that really qualifies as a "house rule" for skill challenges, if published examples and advice are considered.  Automatic successes, as many successes as you can before failure, everyone rolls and keeps the best/worst, etc. aren't in the rules but have been used in official published material.<br/><br/>I think an important change would be to make Skill Challenge XP automatic, win or lose, as was suggested before.  Make the fictional results important, but reward the PCs anyway.  It would probably make the players relax a little bit and not be so intent on min-maxing for every little bonus or wishing that they could get to the end and just move on already.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_223189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223189/#Comment_223189" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-07T09:20:50+00:00" title="August  7, 2009  9:20AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            None of the three groups I'm in use XP so I guess even my RAW skill challenges weren't exactly RAW.<br/><br/>Yeah... no XP for failure and full XP for success is not something I'm on board with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
