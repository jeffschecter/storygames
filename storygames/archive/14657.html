Someone buys, reads, and plays a game.<br/>2. They experience some problems and post about it.<br/>3. People say, "you're playing it wrong." <br/><br/>Everyone goes back and forth and usually discover:<br/><br/>1. The original person didn't read a rule; or<br/>2. The rule to play correctly wasn't in the text; or<br/>3. The rule was in the text but explained in an unclear, inaccessible, hard to find, easy to skip over, or hard to remember manner.<br/><br/>I find <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> to be the most common but that's highly anecdotal!<br/><br/>But the original person bringing up a potential problem is treated in a way that assumes the fault is automatically with them. <br/> <br/>To be fair, the flipside is also true. If someone starts a conversation with, "I played this game and it's totally broken", that's also a problem (depending on your goals for being part of a community).<br/><br/>In my opinion, if you want to encourage open discussion free of bullying,  that people assume little and try their best to reach mutual understanding before making harsh criticisms or absolute statements. Sometimes I make this mistake but I try my best to be aware of it and do better when I can.<br/><br/>In my threads asking people if they felt silenced because of gender or race, many of the responses indicated that they did feel silenced, but for some it wasn't because of their gender or race (although that was also a significant issue, especially gender) but because of threads where a person says they experienced a potential problem with a game and then are treated as if they are the problem.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333458/#Comment_333458" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-07T07:31:21+00:00" title="July  7, 2011  7:31AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Amen!<br/><br/>Now, I have a question about this:<br/><br/>Is this mainly a matter of <i>how</i> people phrase their advice?

[edit: I see it problematic because game tends to imply certain kinds of competition that may not line up well with the actual goals of play, and also because it tends to imply an overall end state which may also be at odds with actual play goals]<br/><br/>Here's really what i'm trying to get at:<br/><br/>Roleplaying games and story games are basically Play Pretend at their core. They're a kind of play pretend with focus ( the games' themes, even in the most basic and broad sense). There are play traditions.<br/><br/>Those things are the core of these activities, but rarely do those things get described well first and foremost. even with indie games of the type common around these parts, there is a real tendency to jump forward into describing the mechanics and structures ( and a big emphasis on those too) before ever hitting on the more basic stuff. And that more basic stuff is just really important. Much more important than the stuff we usually concentrate on.<br/><br/>Damn this is hard to explain. I just think we should try more often to invert the emphasis between those two things, and everything would be a bit clearer.<br/><br/>As one example of what might be something to make clearer in SGs/RPGs generally?<br/><br/>One of the goals of play is to keep play continuing and to keep everyone involved as much as possible until some end state is reached. Or perhaps never stop, in the case of the very traditional on-going, open-ended campaign. Another goal is to encourage a core play group to return and play again, repeatedly ( again, moreso in traditional games with open-ended campaigns). Stuff like that gets implied and kinda discussed, but isn't put at the forefront of emphasis in text.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333482/#Comment_333482" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-07T10:07:47+00:00" title="July  7, 2011 10:07AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I almost think that trying to fight the negative flamey screaming tendencies of internet communication is the wrong way to go.

There's no consensus among your audience about the thing you're trying to assert, so asserting it - or designing based on it - is inevitably going to exclude a portion of the audience.<br/><br/>About the best you could potentially do is fragment off a sub-culture of games, gamers, and play techniques. Maybe it's inevitable that "story games" are going to be their own separate thing from "RPGs", but I don't think it's desirable. Fostering charitable reading, respect for diversity of play and players, and a spirit of inquiry and collaboration seem more fruitful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

Paul and Shreyas seemed to understand the first post perfectly but there seems to be confusion. Apologies if my first post was unclear.<br/><br/>I'm not going to name names or link to threads / blogs because I promised the people who've whispered me to share their experiences that I wouldn't. I'm not interested in calling people out but if any of the people who have whispered me feel comfortable giving specific examples, please feel free. <br/><br/>That said, for clarity, here's a general example:<br/><br/>In Apocalypse World, DC thought he was using Seize By Force vs. Go Aggro correctly but his game seemed problematic. <br/><br/>DC posts about his game. People tell him he played wrong. DC feels frustrated because he read the rules. Then it turns out DC wasn't the only person playing this way. It's a pattern (I personally know several groups who played Apocalypse World and every single one got these rules mixed up). It turns out a lot of people are playing that part of it wrong. And they technically are. But that doesn't mean it is their fault. But because the internet can be a poor medium for communication, people get upset because they feel like they are being blamed for the rules being unclear or that it is their fault they didn't understand them. So DC and friends stop posting after reading reply after reply that they interpret as assigning blame to them coupled with a lack of empathy. NOTE: none of this has anything to do with Vincent. He kicks ass. Please don't draw conclusions because I used AW as an example.<br/><br/>Are the people saying "you're playing wrong" at fault here? No but I don't think it's about fault. I'm just sharing a pattern I see and others have said they see as well. <br/><br/>Paul T and Shreyas asked some great questions on how to avoid this. I've already written too much and typing on my blackberry is draining but I will answer these questions when I have more time to think about them. But to start, putting "wrong" and "right" aside is likely a good beginning, especially when what rules text says and what a designer says and how people actually play seems different. Making it clear that there is no fault as well, and that the rules can be confusing, let's help figure it out together can also help. That said, I know that isn't the style of communication many people employ. And the internet makes it more challenging. I don't expect anyone to change how they communicate. But when people leave, get frustrated, often it's because of things like this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333511/#Comment_333511" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-07T12:51:49+00:00" title="July  7, 2011 12:51PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>Story Games threads would go a lot smoother with a lot less wasted time and bull shit if whenver there was a disagreement y'all would stop arguing back and forth and just ask me for the right answer.

But the people who are responding to you "get it" and have all sorts of cred in the community and are shaking their head at you and talking about how your description of play is throwing up a lot of "red flags" for them and you're not playing it right. And you'd like to play it right, but it's not clear how you are supposed to get from where you are right now to where they stand, master of the game and guy/girl who "gets it," and the book isn't helping and the answer never really was on page 7 unless you squint at it just right. And so eventually you give up on either playing the game or on asking for help because you don't feel like you're getting very far with either.<br/><br/>I think that's what John is talking about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333594/#Comment_333594" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-08T10:20:11+00:00" title="July  8, 2011 10:20AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well...there does seem to be a big gap between The Rules As Written and the game's best practices, typically accumulated and propagated amongst an insular community of players. <br/><br/>We want the RAW to be clear but not overexplain things, so there's room to breathe. I think Czege talks about this in his blogs/posts somewhere -- explain enough for clarity but not so much as to stifle play. <br/><br/>So best practices pop into place eventually. In-the-know guys sort of...take ownership of those practices, even if they're really pretty organic and ultimately collaborative. Those practices are only available if you're in a forum, following threads with talmudic intensity, not pissing off the notables who are putting them out there. <br/><br/>Someone new buys the book and has only the RAW to work from. The RAW almost certainly doesn't include a discussion of best practices until/unless there's a "player's guide" or "Adventure Burner" type product available. There is simply no way to quickly catch up to the best practices thinking of the community at large. They post a problem with their game, the RAW simply does not address the problem, and the big community -- or its notables -- step in.<br/><br/>Maybe they're genuinely helpful (Graham sharing his favorite Lacuna tricks; anyone who had clever ideas on how to use the Psychic Maelstrom). Maybe they're fed up with answering the same questions every week (me, explaining for the millionth time why fictional events don't impact winning/losing in Burning Empires). Maybe they honestly don't know how to answer the question because, shocker, it's the first time someone's brought it up (Harper, holding out for eight pages because I found an unsolveable inconsistency in 3:16). But there's all this territorialism and chest thumping that comes with "the new player" interfacing with "the community" for the first time, and the new player doesn't mesh with the community. And how could they? There's no shared history, no shared knowledge.<br/><br/>Can you write your game's text better? Probably. Honestly I think many/most indie-sized productions simply don't have the play time under their belts prior to publication to really know how they work out in the wild. AW was massively tested yet big swaths of the game continue to elude new players. BW, perhaps the most heavily tested game ever independently published, still needed the Adventure Burner and, soon, the Gold edition to nail it all down more usefully. I think it's just going to happen that way.<br/><br/>* * * * *<br/><br/>Second thought on this: Few things torque me off more than the "talk about your problems" bit JD mentioned. Oh man. I want to throw rocks through your windows when this shit starts. <br/><br/>Not useful (example drawn from actual BW discussion):<br/><br/>Newb: "It seems like there's really no upper cap on what you can specify your intent to be in a versus test. Why wouldn't I just ask to win the war with one roll?"<br/><br/>Insider: "Does that seem fun to you?"<br/><br/>Newb: "Not at all! That's why I'm asking."<br/><br/>Insider: "Then why would you try? Don't you want to have fun?"<br/><br/>Oh for fuck's sake <i>are you kidding me?</i> There is so much judgment and bullshit wrapped up in this: Why are you so preoccupied with winning? Why aren't you sensitive to your responsibilities to facilitate fun at the table?<br/><br/>Useful:<br/><br/>Newb" "It seems like there's really no upper cap on what you can specify your intent to be in a versus test. Why wouldn't I just ask to win the war with one roll?"<br/><br/>Insider: "Because the GM can specify that an intent is inappropriate. Yeah I know it <i>says "say yes or roll the dice"</i> but in practice it isn't that cut and dried. GM still has a lot of discretionary power."<br/><br/>Newb: "But couldn't the GM just deny any intent he didn't feel like allowing?"<br/><br/>Insider: "Procedurally, yeah, but I'd hope everyone's on the same page as to why they're playing the game. I mean if you feel like you're getting reasonable intents shut down maybe you should talk to the GM about it."<br/><br/>And then at least you've moved the conversation to talking between two people who are allegedly at least friendly acquaintances. No RTFM slams (didn't you read "task and intent on page X?"), no "you wouldn't have this problem if you didn't have all this baggage" nonsense.<br/><br/>I was never a close reader of the deep old Forge threads, but my sense in reading various Forge-y blogs over the years is that there's a lot of blame-the-victim going around. If the game doesn't work it's because you're not playing it in the correct spirit. If a system falls apart it's because you've got baggage. If you can't find the fun in the game "it's not for you." I mean, yeah, those things <i>might</i> be true. What I, personally, don't love is that these are the easy go-to answers any more.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333596/#Comment_333596" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-08T10:29:20+00:00" title="July  8, 2011 10:29AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bret Gillan</cite>So here's a situation. The answer is on page 7. Sort of. But it's not very well explained. But the people who are responding to you "get it" and have all sorts of cred in the community and are shaking their head at you and talking about how your description of play is throwing up a lot of "red flags" for them and you're not playing it right.</blockquote>\nWell, in that case, I really REALLY want them to say "you're wrong, look on page 7" so I can explain what I took from page 7, or why I don't want to do what's on page 7 for some other reason, or how come I just flat missed page 7, or how I don't think what they think about page 7 is right at all, or whatever, rather than being vague about red flags and muttering about my motives.<br/><br/>Maybe I just have a lot more practice at being wrong than most people, and it doesn't bother me as much?<br/><br/>People, practice being wrong!
