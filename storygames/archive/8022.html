There are links in that thread to various iterations as it evolves.  It started out as a fairly accurate map of real people in a real power structure, pulled from Friedman's book <i>Red Mafiya</i> and then it went off in its own television direction once play began.  I update it in Visio, since that's what I happen to have on hand.  <br/><br/>In play, whenever I want to frame a scene or introduce some element, I return to the map and see if there's someone directly attached to a protagonist that can be involved.  I also look to create connections to people who have not been touched yet.  Last week I knew the Genovese crime family would be in touch with the protagonists, but not when or how (it was a "next week on... element).  When one of the guys ended up in prison, I looked at my R-Map and threw the named Genovese soldier in there with him.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177115/#Comment_177115" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-03T05:03:11+00:00" title="November  3, 2008  5:03AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you read <i>Sorcerer's Soul</i>?<br/><br/>Also - and I'm sure this sort of pedantry is frowned upon - what Jason describes is more properly a <i>story map</i>, not a <i>relationship map</i>.

Censorship. Create a conflict. Those for censorship and those against. On a piece of paper, draw a line down the middle. Each side representing 1 side of the conflict. <br/><br/>Write down a few words or phrases describing each side. What happens if one side wins? When and where does this take place?<br/><br/>What are the biggest obstacles stopping either side from winning? Who are the biggest assets helping either side? These are the key characters on each side of the conflict. What side of the conflict do they represent? Write their name on that side. Next to their name, write why they are important to the conflict in a word or two. <br/><br/>Who supports these key characters? For each key character, name 1-2 supporting characters. Write their names near the key characters they support. If each key character represents their side of the conflict, each supporting character represents more nuanced aspects of each key character. These aspects can be contrasting views, extreme views, conflicts of interest, reasons why there is a conflict, reflections of future consequences and so on. Write down what aspects these supporting characters represent next to their name in a word or two. <br/><br/>Each character has a relationship with at least 2 other characters. Draw lines connecting all related characters. <br/><br/>If the relationship is friendly, add a "O" at the beginning of the line: [character 1]O--------&gt;[character 2] <br/><br/>If the relationship is antagonistic, add an "X" at the beginning of the line: [character 1]X--------&gt;[character 2] <br/><br/>If character 1 is antagonistic to character 2 but character 2 is friendly to character 1, do the following: [character 1]X--------O[character 2] <br/><br/>Add 1-3 words describing the relationship on the lines connecting the characters. These words could describe how they are connected or what they want from each other. <br/><br/>Make sure each relationship is relevant to the overall conflict. Add relationships to people on opposite sides of the conflict. Create relationship triangles. 2 characters hate each other but 1 character loves both. <br/><br/>On a separate piece of paper, you can describe each character in more detail. Sometimes I do this by writing down the name of someone I know who the character is based on. Other times I will add a picture of an actor so I know what the character looks like (imdb.com is great for this). Sometimes I will write down 1-3 words describing who the character appears to be. And then 1-3 words describing who they actually are. I also like to write down what they need, what makes them human, likeable, or relatable, a line of example dialogue, why the players should care about them, what valuable information they have (often via rumors or gossip), and little cues on how to act as that character (speech pattern, gesture, prop, a quirky behavior). <br/><br/>Go back over all of the above and imagine you had to cut out half of it. What can you remove? What can you combine? What can you simplify? Do it! <br/><br/>Now we have a conflict, characters relevant to the conflict, relationships and so on. No one has taken action yet. Look at your map. Think of something that can happen that everyone would care about that would force everyone to respond. It could be murdering a character everyone is connected to. Something that would threaten to tear everything apart. Sensible people start acting stupidly. People become desperate. Time is of the essence. People must act now! Or the consequences will be deep and immediate. <br/><br/>But who are the players? Are they select characters described above? Are they outsiders thrown in the middle of this mess? What are their goals? What actions must they take? What are their biggest obstacles? What stops them from solving the conflict in the first scene? Why must they act now? <br/><br/>In one shot games, we usually have the players choose characters above or help build the map together. To start, we don't know who the protagonists or antagonists are. It's interesting who transforms into an antagonist simply based on who the players choose to play as protagonists.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177125/#Comment_177125" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-03T06:21:06+00:00" title="November  3, 2008  6:21AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The step of simplifying, combining, and removing elements is extremely important. If it takes me more than 5 seconds to look something up, it's too much of a distraction in play. I also try to leave you anything I can come up with on the fly. Also it is important to not that the characters don't have to be actual people. They could be groups, ideas, locations, or items.<br/><br/>I also like to include a list of key locations with the 2-3 details that describe the location and a few interactive objects that can either help or hinder those interacting with them. I usually add them to the map close to the characters that tend to frequent those locations or add them to the separate piece of paper that details the characters. <br/><br/>Paul T. and I were discussing R-map techniques in detail a few weeks ago. I'll try to post some of our notes.

Joker is batman's as an outsider, a freak or sometimes as a symbol. Twoface is batman's dual nature of batman and Bruce Wayne. The Riddler is batman's investigative genius side. Catwoman his sexuality. Mr. Freeze his sense of loss. Penguin his issues with class. Robin his childhood. Commissioner Gordan his sense of justice.<br/>\n<br/>\nReplace batman with a player character. Build the cast of NPCs as metaphors around them. Rip out their characteristics and grow NPCs from them. They can reinforce, exaggerate, challenge, conflict, or question these characteristics.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul T. likes to build relationships via important traits. You write down the PCs on the borders of a piece of paper. Next to their names, write down their important traits. In the Shadow of Yesterday this might be their keys. In Burning Wheel, their beliefs. In D&amp;D; their class, skills, feats, and powers. Example: PC with a trait "world class martial artist". Where did they get this trait? Who taught them? Where? Who helped them? Who opposed them? Who competed with them? Who looked up to them? Who did they accidentally hurt? Take the trait and ask questions to delve into the traits history and build conflicted relationships from that history. This way you not only build conflicts that revolve around the player character but you create situation where what makes the character cool, their traits, are in the spotlight.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother technique is to pick an existing story that interests you (from a historical event, news article, book, comic, TV show, movie). Create an R-map as detailed in this thread. But use the characters and relationships from the story you picked. Change the characters names with people in your game but keep everything else the same. Bam! I believe this technique was originally from Sorcerer and Soul and Ron's text goes into way more detail on how to accomplish this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://games.spaceanddeath.com/sin_aesthetics/54" rel="nofollow">Mo has a great technique for building R-maps based on connections using Blood (family), Sex, Money, and Violence with Dogs in the Vineyard style town creation.</a><br/>\n<br/>\nYou could also build an R-map where everyone is connected via gossip and rumors! And you determine what's bs and what's true in the game itself!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother idea I've been playing with is building R-maps for tactical encounters. Choose a theme, lay down the tactical strengths and weaknesses of each player, choose what is at stake, add a time is ticking element and then use this information to build a web of opponents, allies, obstacles, aids, and challenges. I'm still working on this.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this helps!<br/>\n<br/>\nBest,<br/>\nJohn                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177149">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177149/#Comment_177149" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-03T09:38:17+00:00" title="November  3, 2008  9:38AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I pillaged Mo's Blood, Sex, Money and Violence for a "chapter based, each chapter a relationship of one of types" approach to PC group/campaign kick off recently and it worked pretty well creating grist that Players grab onto when it comes into the game.<br><br>Rob                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177151">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177151/#Comment_177151" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-03T09:59:06+00:00" title="November  3, 2008  9:59AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 3, 2008 10:11AM by Brand_Robins.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So yea, Dogs town creation is basically a way to make a relationship map. <br><br>So is <a href="http://games.spaceanddeath.com/sin_aesthetics/54" rel="nofollow">Mo's already mentioned Blood and Sex map builder</a>. (Yes, link to builder, which you said you didn't want -- however, there's also two example maps on there that are both cool.) <br><br>Both of these things work for me because they start with a focus on characters, build relationships between them based on a specific and game relevant set of criteria, and at the same time makes the characters as human beings with real strengths and weaknesses. One should, I think, create characters who are interlinked rather than creating characters and then trying to interlink them. And those relationships, and their scope, should be the setting of the game. <br><br>That is to say, if you've made a town full of sinning people, then the people and their sins are the setting of the game. If you've made a relationship map about a group of incestuous pirates and the three city-states that hate but use them, then that is the setting. <br><br>That setting also needs to be dynamic and moving. I've seen a lot of relationship maps (including ones I make) that describe a static situation. "Susie likes Tom who likes Alice who likes Susie, but they're all being pretty quiet about it." NO! It should be "Susie likes Tom and is going to ask him to the Sadie Hawkins dance TODAY, but Tom likes Alice who is going to ask Susie to the Sadie Hawkins dance TODAY, and Tom happens to be a homophobe who has a past grudge against Sadie." And then you should be all like "Oh shit, Tom is totally going to attack Susie, and what the fuck are the PCs going to do about all this?" <br><br>Which brings me to the next point: the PCs have to be involved in the map, deeply. This can be because they have an inbuilt reason or authority, like Dogs or Trollbabes, or because they're already part of the map themselves. (PC Chris is Tom's best friend, and hates Alice because she jilted him...). Big maps full of interconnected NPCs that don't connect personally and instantly to the PCs are asking for pain.<br><br>Once you've got that, you just need to make sure there is no way to make everyone on the map happy, and that no matter what happens someone is going to be pissed, hurt, blackmailed, killed or whatever. And that they've got connections to others who will have reasons to give a shit about that. Then no matter what happens one person is going to be yanking on people all around them, who will yank on others, and so everything that happens just keeps pushing more things to happen. A well set up relationship map is a cyclical chain reaction ready to happen, really.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Yokiboy" title="Yokiboy"><img alt="Yokiboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Yokiboy">Yokiboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177152/#Comment_177152" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-03T10:01:49+00:00" title="November  3, 2008 10:01AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Have you read<i>Sorcerer's Soul</i>?<br><br>Also - and I'm sure this sort of pedantry is frowned upon - what Jason describes is more properly a<i>story map</i>, not a<i>relationship map</i>.

I ask Shannon how Arras is going about this. She says she's looking for a sugar daddy; someone to pay her tab for the night (we're tracking money in this game, and it's a big deal, so she's trying to protect her coin purse during this night of madness). So, being the dutiful GM that I am, I glance over the relationship map to see who could use some spotlight time. My eyes fall on "Stevred Kurz, Prince of Praag." Bingo.<br/><br/>She finds her sugar daddy. Then she crits on her Charm roll, and totally wins him over. They do some black lotus and sleep together and the Prince falls hard for wild-and-crazy Arras. As you can see from the current version of the map, above, that night of debauchery has lead to fun story consequences ("demonic pregnancy" for one).<br/><br/>So that's one technique, which Andy calls "conservation of NPCs." When you need a character for a scene, just scan that map and grab a likely suspect. This keeps everything tightly tied together, story wise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177214/#Comment_177214" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-03T16:00:49+00:00" title="November  3, 2008  4:00PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a gorgeous map, what did you use to make it?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177215">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177215/#Comment_177215" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-03T16:04:22+00:00" title="November  3, 2008  4:04PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 3, 2008 4:05PM by John_Harper.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, JD.

The game is about the adult children of the recently-deceased Lord Scurlock, so the backbone of the map is the dead father and his offspring (with the heavy black borders) with everything else linking off from there.<br/><br/>If you go in with an organizing principle, you'll find it easier to construct the map in the first place and easier to modify as you go. My map, above, has gotten crowded to the point where it doesn't communicate as well as it could to an outside observer, but since the map is only for use in play, I don't need to worry about that too much.

It was photos with names arranged to show who ranked who in whatever organized crime they were targeting.<br/><br/>In the first season, this was Avon Barksdale's drug gang: the detail had their corkboard set up to show how Avon connected to his second-in-command Stringer Bell, who the lieutenants were and how they connected to the street dealers, and the goal was to find the elusive connection between the lieutenants and Bell and thus upwards to Avon so that they could bust 'em all.  As the investigation progressed, they'd add new photos to the board and occasionally additional information (like if they could link a particular player in the gang to a crime, that would be attached to the guy's photo).<br/><br/>There was also a supplementary corkboard, which was used to organize the money trail in investigations where they were chasing the dollars; if a payoff went into someone's pocket, the paper trail showing where that money came from would be laid out on the board, with lines shooting off to connect it to the criminals involved.<br/><br/>The advantage for a game that I can see is that if you do it with cards on a bulletin board, you can shift things around in a very dynamic way:  when one guy gets got (and in The Wire, most everyone below a certain level of the organization is guaranteed to get got sooner or later, and probably sooner), you can draw a big X over his name and slide in the guy who moved up to take over his role.  If you're tracking something less organized than a drug gang, you can shift the positions of the cards and the lines connecting them as favors and influence demand.  With something like an evidence board, you could even track game events the same way.<br/><br/><br/>I imagine a lot of the appeal would be in the artifact itself:  having seen The Wire, I would totally get how awesome having a board set up was.
