                    Inspired by a pointer to an <a href="http://www.enworld.org/showthread.php?t=178306" rel="nofollow">ENWorld discussion</a> here, and also <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1678&amp;page=1#Item_32" rel="nofollow">a recent thread here</a>--what is it that people mean by Fiat? I'm not a big fan of the term myself. I've used it in the (distant) past, but now I think I see implications that wouldn't have occurred to me.<br/><br/>Possibilities (probably not exhaustive):<br/><br/>--Fudging or overruling dicerolls when they produce an unwanted effect<br/>--Overruling rules when they yield a nonsensical effect<br/>--Making on the spot rulings to bridge holes in the rules (like, how long does it take to get across the lake in a rowboat, assuming that matters)<br/>--Making on the spot rulings to bridge holes in preparation (like, is there a doctor in town?)<br/>--Judging whether a particular rule applies to a given situation<br/>--Judging which factors apply to a given situation<br/><br/>And does it matter what the GM's motive or criterion is for doing any of these things? E.g., is it "GM Fiat" to rule that a struggle for possession of a gun will be governed by a straight comparison of two characters' Strength? Or is it only "Fiat" if the GM would choose Dexterity if it led to what was, in the GM's judgment, a more satisfying direction for play?<br/><br/>Does it matter if the GM's ruling has only a partial effect on whatever the player/group cares about? E.g., the GM states that characters who fall off a cliffside during a fight will die, automatically. But players can still influence whether their characters die--by avoiding falling offf the cliff.<br/><br/>Does it matter if the GM's ruling comes before or after the execution of a resolution mechanic? I.e., in the previous example, is it Fiat if the first time a character falls off the cliff, the GM goes "He's dead, dude", when the players hadn't been told explicitly that it was a 1000 foot drop, with no handholds, onto sharp rocks?<br/><br/>Obviously I'd like to hear what people think, but my feeling at the moment is that "GM Fiat" is one of those terms whose flexibility of meaning hinders communication rather than easing it. In my opinion it'd be far better for people to be explicit in their discussion of a variety of game mechanics and gaming styles instead of classing them all under "GM Fiat".                </div>

                            For my purposes, GM Fiat is when any game-altering decision is made by the GM without any explicit procedures -- it's using the GM as a black box, and it's bad design in my world.  I do distinguish, though, between GM Fiat (unprincipled decisions made by the GM) and GM Discretion (principled decisions made by the GM).  If there is some guidance for the GM, and more importantly, guidance for the players as to what they should expect from the GM, then I find the rules much more tenable.  If it's just "the GM should have some sort of mystical gut feeling for what to do right here," then the game designer didn't earn his paycheck.                        </div>

                            I think it's a term that falls right beside railroading; rather useless, unless it's defined more carefully. Joshua makes a good distinction between GM Fiat and GM Discretion, though we might have very different views on what the discretion is. Perhaps GM Fiat, in bad light, could be thought as GM using his power against the rules (written or unwritten ones). Because if the rules that everyone has agreed upon state that the GM controls everything that characters do not control based on what ever procedures, information or instinct he has, it should be cool. Wheter that's intresting, is a matter of preference.                        </div>

                            My rough-and-ready understanding of the phrase is : resolution of important changes to the fiction by arbitrarily changeable procedures or procedures that are not known and understood by all participants. There are an immense number of edge cases, and much like 'Force' there is a huge 'it depends' component which is focused on whether the decision that is being made non-transparently and/or arbitrarily is seen as important. Many things that are 'GM Fiat' in one instance are just 'Scene Framing' in another one.                        </div>

                            Yeah, the problem with "Fiat" is the GM deciding that he has some "golden rule" authority to void the rules of the game. Even in a game where that authority is given by the rules it's bad.<br/>
<br/>
If the rules don't work, play by other rules. But that's not the same as temporarily sidestepping the rules in the middle of the game to get an effect you want. If that's allowed, then the game is entirely GM Fiat, no matter how much you roll the dice.<br/>

I don't see anything inheritly bad on roleplaying relying on GM's own talents, rather than tools or procedures that guide GM'ing - like you said, it can produce fabulous play (or it can provide absolutely horrid play, or probably something in between). I don't see the relevance of designing a game here; a (well or not well) designed game is in no way fundamental for roleplaying; there's plenty of freeform out there. "Game", in this context, representing a written text describing the procedures and structure of play.<br><br>Guidance is important, yes; this guidance can come from social contract, written or unwritten, from the skill of players, or somewhere else. As long as there is mutual understanding of how things work out in the diegesis (*, and this understanding is not broken with or without other participants noticing it, I don't GM Fiat happens in the ugly sense of the word.<br><br>This wanders a bit from the topic of the thread, so we might want to start another one, if needed.<br/><br/>*) Imagined space, SIS, etc. I just happen to like "Diegesis".                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            So, there seem to be three types of GM Fiat, here.<br/><br/>-When the rules dictate that something must happen, but the GM decides something else happens instead.<br/>-When the rules dictate that the GM must make up something, and the GM does so.<br/>-When the rules are silent about something, and the GM makes up something to fill the void.<br/><br/>The first has the best chance of leading to dysfunctional play, but it is by no means a given that it will.  The second is the most common, and would include (in my mind) things like the GM making up NPCs or, you know, the adventure.  The third puts the most strain on the GM, and is what Joshua is calling 'bad game design'.  However, I'd say that while a low-crunch game might be able to anticipate all situations by having simple mechanics and catch-all rules, in a high-crunch game this is nearly impossible.  One of the hallmarks of a good GM for a high-crunch system is that they can decide quickly what rules to use when, and can make up rules that appeal to the group when they need to.                        </div>

                            I don't know if "high-crunch" games really <em>require</em> that sort of GM Fiat, Lucian.  In my experience, most high-crunch games are high-crunch in specific, highlighted areas (usually combat, sometimes vehicle design, sometimes setting-construction) and are relatively low-crunch for everything else, but still have some mechanical support for things that fall outside of the focused material.  Of course, my reference points for this are GURPS (rule for everything) and World of Darkness (high-crunch supernatural, low-crunch day-to-day).<br/><br/>Can you give me a specific example / AP to help me understand what you're getting at, Lucian?                        </div>

                            Fred, ADRP makes <b>Drama Resolution</b>  the pillar of the system, not Fiat. In practice, it often ends up being fiat, because there's so little guidance for making the decisions principled and transparent. But happy ADRP players have got enough of a shared culture of play that decisionmaking is, in effect, sufficiently transparent not to be "fiat". (As I understand fiat).                        </div>

                            Mike, that would narrow the definition, certainly.   I don't know if it would narrow it constructively.  In common parlance, "GM Fiat" usually just means "the GM pulls it out of his ass."  Whether he does that to the benefit of the orc horde or not is not a strong part of how people use it, in my experience.                        </div>

                            Lucian, thank you for that breakdown. But it overlooks another dimension which I pointed to (and I think Joshua sees it, too). Let's look at the second case--"the rules dictate that the GM must make up something, and the GM does so."<br/><br/>As a side point, this is often implied rather than explicit, or it's a consequence of the basic paradigm of "who controls what". In other words, when a player says "My character peers across the valley, what does he see?" or "I yell at the perp to drop his weapon and put his hands in the air", RPGs typically don't formalize the shift over to the GM. It's implied that the players now look to the GM to say what happens, and often what the GM says will be made up on the fly. Then there's the case of players who get off their leash, narrating one action after another until somebody--usually the GM--steps in and says, "Hang on, before you can do all that..." The converse is also notable: the GM who says all kinds of stuff happen before the players can react. I suppose you could say that whole business falls under "the rules are silent and void is filled by the authority vested in the GM to use discretion".<br/><br/>But moving on, even when it's clear that it's the GM's "turn" to come up with something, I don't think there's broad agreement that this is always "Fiat". When the GM is filling the need for an unanticipated detail, but does so in a way that flows naturally from the situation and player input, is that "Fiat"? Like if I walk up to a guy standing at the bar wearing a black hat and throw a glass of whisky in his face, is it "Fiat" for the GM to say the guy takes a swing at me? If he draws his gun and starts shooting? Licks his lips, laughs heartily, and claps me over the shoulder? Hard to say, although the perception of "Fiat" may be related to whether the player has a specific "narrative intent" that he wants to achieve through his action. The player who's trying to create a fight scene is more likely to see "Fiat" (especially in the negative sense) if the GM comes back with option 3, than the player who's only interested in "playing his character".                        </div>

                            JBR: Well, it makes the distinction between "the GM pulls it out of his ass" versus "the GM pulls it out of his ass and it's unfair." I guess GM Discretion might adequately cover the former. (Yeah, I know you can't wave a magic wand and change common usage.)                        </div>

                            Thanks, Mark. You see what I'm getting at. Fred, "Amber relies on GM Fiat" begs the question of "what is GM Fiat?" and whether the term is even useful in the first place.<br/><br/>Misuba (Mike?) I don't see a huge benefit to trying to narrow the definition down. Certainly it's too early at this point, and frankly I'm against jargonizing commonly-used terms. If there are a variety of meanings in common use, and those meanings cause problems in serious discussion, the solution in my opinion is to use different words--either more precise, concrete words (and probably more of them) or carefully defined <b>new</b> terms.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>For my purposes, GM Fiat is when any game-altering decision is made by the GM without any explicit procedures -- it's using the GM as a black box, and it's bad design in my world. I do distinguish, though, between GM Fiat (unprincipled decisions made by the GM) and GM Discretion (principled decisions made by the GM). If there is some guidance for the GM, and more importantly, guidance for the players as to what they should expect from the GM, then I find the rules much more tenable. If it's just "the GM should have some sort of mystical gut feeling for what to do right here," then the game designer didn't earn his paycheck.</blockquote>

                            Clarified:<br/><br/>GM Fiat, away from resolution, is just authority. Every game's got some distribution of authority, and when you use it, you're <b>saying what happens</b>. You can argue over whether a given game's distribution of authority is a happy and functional one, but as long as authority is being used in such a way that there is no meaningful disagreement over what happens, you're just playing an RPG. Fiat <b>as a resolution tool</b> is where badness <b>potentially</b> happens.<br/><br/>When you need resolution is when the outcome of some event in the fiction is (a) uncertain to at least one player who has a stake in that outcome and (b) more than one outcome is reasonable within the known/agreed context of principled decisions possible in this game. One way to get resolution is Drama - someone decides based on some agreed standard "what should happen." Functional Drama resolution uses <i>principled</i> decisions - decisions driven by some known model of "what should happen", such that if all participants in the resolution had "all the facts" there would be general agreement about the outcome. Bad Drama resolution uses inconsistent decisions, such that the actual decision model being used is not the one which would be agreed to by all participants if they "had all the facts."<br/><br/>It's this case when you have the bad kind of fiat: when the rules that are <b>actually</b> being used to make decisions about outcomes are not the same as the rules people <b>think</b> are being used, <b>and the actual rules would not be agreed to if known.</b> </div>

                            Kriegspiel was the old German training excersises that were _a_precursor to miniature wargames played by the public. In Kriegspiel, players and referees regularly referred to some "highly scientific" formulas covering just about anything that thre cadets came up with: Average enemy casualties at range X, under conditions Y, and so on. <br/><br/>Then, somebody decided to try a variant: Frei (Free War-Play) Kriegspiel, which relied vastly less upon said books of formula, and vastly more on the experiences of the refs on the actual battlefield. All decisions ( since there were no die throws or what-not) were made essentially by the cadets doing their best, based on what they'd learned in the classroom ( including the aforementioned "formulas") and the refs deciding and out-come based on that plus their own experience.<br/><br/>Essentially, that _was_ the system.<br/><br/>The thing is, at the time, it was considered a radical change, and (later) a vast improvement over the earlier form of Kreigspiel.                        </div>

                            Frei Kriegspiel or Free Kriegspiel is a kind of wargaming that was used by the 19th century German army and others. What distinguished it from Rigid Kriegspiel was that the latter would use a set of prescribed rules and formulae for determining the outcome of engagements which arose from maneuvers. Free Kriegspiel instead depended on a judge, preferably an officer with battlefield experience, to determine the result based on an impartial evaluation. Rules vs. free could also extend to areas like movement over terrain, transmission of orders, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Edited to add (to disagree slightly with bob), there were actually some fierce arguments over whether free Kriegspiel was better or not, and I don't think they've settled down to this day. The modern US military and foreign policy establishments use both.                        </div>

                            Problem with Mark's post: I disagree that it's bad for "one person decides" to be based on a principle "everyone would agree with the decision if they had all the facts".<br/>
<br/>
First of all, I have to cut Mark some slack by assuming that part of the "the facts" is the motivation behind the decision. If everyone agrees that the motivation is simply to say what should "naturally" happen, that may produce a different outcome from what would happen if everyone agreed that the motivation should be to have the most entertaining thing possible happen.<br/>
<br/>
More important, at a given "atomic" moment of resolution, I don't see a broad agreement that functional "Drama" requires everyone to be happy with the decision. On some social level, they have to respect the decision, but beyond that, all bets are off. At least that's how I read a lot of what TonyLB writes here and elsewhere.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>I don't know if player intent really feeds into what is and is not GM Fiat, Eliot.  Certainly player intent and especially stymied player intent will feed into players<em>complaining about</em>fiat, but that's not the same thing.</blockquote>Let me see if I can come up with an example. Okay, you're fighting a bunch of dudes riding on, oh, woolly rhinoceroses in the dead of winter. So you come up with a plan to lure them across a frozen river so that the rhinos will break through the ice. Maybe you roll dice at some point to see if you can avoid the riders' arrows long enough, or you use some kind of pursuit/positioning subsystem to see if you reach the river before they catch you. You make it across.<br/><br/>But then when the rhinos hit the river, nothing happens. GM: "The ice is extremely thick here." You: "No way can a frozen river support a rhino." Fiat?<br/><br/>But suppose the GM says, "The rhinos seem unwilling to cross the flat surface of the river, but their riders goad them on. As you watch them from the far side, they get halfway across. Suddenly a terrible cracking sound is followed by the roar of collapsing ice and the screams of the beasts as they plunge into the freezing waters." Fiat?<br/><br/>Edit: not sure that's the greatest example for my purposes (although it's a scenario I'd like to play, cos, you know, <i>woolly war rhinoceroses</i>). What I'm trying to say is, is it GM Fiat if the GM is just ruling something that would proceed naturally from the situation, even though it's not covered explicitly by the rules?<br/><br/>I think Mark would say it's "Functional Fiat".                        </div>

                            You got me right, Elliot. Fiat isn't automatically bad, so your example looks to me like the functional kind - the GM makes a decision that is <i>de novo</i> (not based on some established precedent or agreed standard), but is accepted as consistent with expectations and the extent of the GM's authority. That decision now becomes part of the established body of game experience against which future decisions will be judged for consistency.<br/><br/>Right in the middle there, though, you've got the seeds of bad fiat. There's a challenge posed as to whether this decision is, in fact, going by the expected rules: "No way can a frozen river support a rhino!" At that point, the GM's got two (legit, functional) choices - they can either justify the decision (and sometimes, that justification will be indefinitely deferred, but eventually enough unjustified decisions hanging out there and the game breaks), or they can reconsider. They've also got a crap choice. They can rationalize (including by introducing "new factors" to alter the situation), make excuses, lie, or just plain shut down the objection because it's not what <i>they want</i> to have happen. Why is this a crap choice? Because it makes it impossible for the players to understand the real rules in play, and thus degrades their ability to make their input meaningful and effective.<br/><br/>In this example, though, the GM is justifying the hell out of their decision, in my own personal book. Massive rhino drowning is very much cooler than thwarted rhinos OR featherweight rhinos. If your game, however, is not run on the Principle of Maximum Awesome but rather on the What Would Really Happen Rule, the GM just boned you.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>Is it possible to railroad without Fiating?</blockquote>
Sure, though depending on how we want to define railroading. You create a scenario which, in a way that makes sense, enforces the characters to do something or not to do something. You create a situtation/scenario with constraints that characters cannot overcome. Then, as the GM, you stick within these constraints.<br/><br/>For example: You create a scenario where characters are in a large passanger ship, which is middle of a sea, in cold winter climate. You have decided that the ship will sink at 12.00 pm and you have sketched a plausible reason for this, a reason that's not apparent to the players and one that they probably won't be noticing until the ship sinks. <br/><br/>You have now a situation in which characters have to live inside the constraints the GM created and in which GM can base his decisions on his discretion (he knows what will happen to the ship and why, he roughly knows how passanger ships are operated and what's usually happening in a routine passanger ship cruise).<br/><br/>As for the GM Fiat itself, I think Mark, Matt and Elliot are certainly on the right path. Wheter working GM Fiat/Discretion is a good thing, is a matter of preference. I like it, both as a player and GM and see it as a vital component for freeform/immersive playing (until someone comes up with a mechanic that doesen't actively hinder it).                        </div>

                            In Paranoia XP, GM Fiat is listed in the "armour" section, as the most powerful sort of armour you can get.<br/><br/>It's available only for NPCs who are integral to the plot. Perhaps they have a force field. Perhaps they're just miraculously lucky. But they're impossible to kill.<br/><br/>In my opinion, <i>that's</i> how you use Fiat: with the players' full knowledge of what you're doing. It's participationism, in other words:<br/><br/><i>Player: I shoot him.<br/>GM: Well, what do you know? Your laser's not working. That's unfortunate.<br/>Player: OK, I hit the guy.<br/>GM: Right. Even with the CCTV cameras watching you? With their automatic violence-defusing stun lasers?<br/>Player: Yes.<br/>GM: [Rolls dice secretly] Oooh, you missed. Unlucky today.<br/>Player: I'll do something else, shall I?<br/>GM: Probably best.</i><br/><br/>It's still fun, because the players know what the deal is. It works in D&amp;D too:<br/><br/><i>Player: I'm going to kill the oracle.<br/>GM: Right. Well, you know, sensing your movement, the bodyguards interpose themselves between you and him.<br/>Player: I can't kill the oracle, can I?<br/>GM: No, I'm going to use him in a moment.<br/>Player: Fair enough.</i><br/><br/>It might not be the sort of game you like, but it's not a <i>bad</i> tactic. Everyone knows what's going on. <br/><br/>I realise I'm saying nothing new here, but the whole negative tone around GM Fiat and Railroading bothers me. There's no sense of "the GM boned you". Provided everyone knows what's going on, it's perfectly functional play..<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Far as I'm concerned, GM fiat is just a slightly loaded term for GM's discretion, or any point where the GM has to make a decision that isn't interpretation of the system.  It's where the GM has The Say in play.  Or to reduce it even further, it's the GM's point of contribution to the game.<br/><br/>I don't agree that it's bad desgn though.  It seems that it can be used for good or for evil - all games with GMs require it at some point after all otherwise they wouldn't require a GM.  And there's a big difference between letting the Gm contribute to the game at all, and making the GM carry the game with their decisions.  But it seems that they're the same thing to me and the difference is just a matter of degree.<br/><br/>Defining fiat as discretion sans guidance doesn't seem terribly useful to me.  It's like "Y is the bad kind of X, and Z is the good kind", where it's X that's the important definition and Y and Z are all too context-relative to be terribly important.<br/><br/>Still - I reckon it's very important to recignise Gm fiat, and especially where it butts up against the authority of the system.  I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of the "used for evil" aspect comes from badly defining its role, or mechanics that awkwardly overlap it .                        </div>

                            Literally, GM Fiat would be when something happens "because the GM says so". I think the functional definitions people have going here are pretty good, although ultimately you're always going to get into a situation where one person's "Fiat" is another person's "logical extrapolation of events."<br/><br/>I'd also agree with those who are saying that Fiat is not *necessarily* bad - there will always be situations where nobody's sure what should happen, and in some systems it falls to the GM to decide.                        </div>

                            I think the term refers to any decision the GM makes that is <i>completely</i> arbitrary and does <i>not</i> fit into a logical framework or a dramatic sense. Like railroading, I think it refers to a kind of dysfunction.<br/><br/>Here is why: If it refers to simple decisions within a logical framework then Town Creation in DitV is GM fiat. Yes, there are strong constraints--but determining what the sin is and who the principals are is an arbitrary GM decision. If it refers to things that fall into a logical framework (albeit outside the rules) then <i>Sorcerer</i> is a game laden with GM Fiat when the GM determines what's behind the player's Kickers.<br/><br/>Even MLWM will have GM Fiat when the Master determines a mission or the NPCs say lines ("What does the NPC say?" It's determined by GM Fiat!).<br/><br/>The term isn't used that way. It's often code for railroading. We see here it's "that thing you like but I don't." <br/><br/>So I think it's when the GM is making <i>completely</i> arbitrary decisions that serve an undisclosed GM agenda (simply "raising the stakes" in a way that makes sense to the players but does not disempower them significantly is not, IMO, GM Fiat).<br/><br/>Alternatively:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.fiat-coupe.fsnet.co.uk/le/black/005_b.jpg"/><br/>(The GM's)<br/><br/>-Marco                        </div>

If something needs to happen to make the game move forward in an enjoyable fashion, it falls to the GM to judge and execute that task. This avoids both bickering and drifts into pointless, unenjoyable play. (Somebody correct me if I'm totally setting up a strawman here.)<br/>
<br/>
The reason I think GM Fiat is looked upon negatively in this here neck of the woods has nothing to do with system, it's the social problem. Once everyone has bought into the notion that the GM's word is final and that's that, there's these huge horrible potential for the thing to start getting mixed up in the GM's ego. If players lose sight of the boundary between system and social contract, which is often the case, then they've bought into a situation where it's not okay to complain if they're unhappy or not having fun, because the GM is the lord of the game, right? Enter a whole lot of "If you don't like it, don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out!" talk instead of constructive dialog. If the players stand up for themselves, the GM takes it as a personal slight, because "the rules" say he's in the right. There's like this mental cudgel that enforces this screwed-up social situation, and games that become some sick duty instead of mutual fun.<br/>
<br/>
If you doubt it, take a look at some of those ENWorld posts. Whole lotta defensiveness goin' on.<br/>
<br/>
From a design point of view, the issue becomes Why would I want to include this element in my game that facilitates such dysfunction, when it is possible to design around it? GM-tasks can be broken up in more egalitarian fashion. The rules can provide less subjective means of rules disputes by actually presenting coherent rules. In many ways, GM Fiat is the antithesis of good game Design, with GM Fiat being a necessary evil ("my GM Herbie") that has had to exist to make "broken" designs function.<br/>
<br/>
And how come nobody ever coined the term "player fiat"?                        </div>

Funny that, I though about the same thing yesterday. If player is entitled to make decisions solely based on his own judgement (not a stat or some other element and not based on some procedure), I'd argue that it's a Player Fiat. With pretty much same notes that GM Fiat has. They can co-exist (and pretty often do, especially in freeform), though there's a potential hassle if they clash and no one has defined which one prevails.                        </div>

With fiat, you get good play with a good GM, bad play with a bad GM - which leads us back to...<br/>
System dosen't matter, all that matters is the will of the GM.<br/>
<br/>
It's a bit like "say yes or roll the dice" except the GM can always say yes to himself!<br/>
<br/>
The only way to eliminate GM fiat is by mechanics. Either do away with the GM role completely or curtail the GM's fiat by limiting his resources the same way player resources are limited.<br/>
<br/>
IMHO GM fiatless play is more fun as the quality of the game dosen't hinge entirely on one participant.                        </div>

Because the games in which the players are given the kind of authority that would lead to such a term being coined either a) don't exist, or 2) are games in which <em>everyone</em> has "fiat", i.e., GM-less games. IMO.<br><br>Since I was flailing around in the ENWorld thread, lemme jump in with a question or two.<br><br>How do games like HERO or GURPS fit into this discussion?  Both of these games are incredibly deep and rules-robust, yet both explicitly give blanket power to the GM to ignore any of their comprehensive rulesets at will, with no more than "tough shit" as a justification to players. "Do what's good for the story."<br><br>In contrast, you've got more recent systems like BW/BE that don't give anywhere near this kind of explicit authority to the GM.<br><br>In the middle (at least, as-written, IMO), you've got D&amp;D, which goes to great lengths to let DMs know that, despite having vast authority, they need to act fairly and responsibly, and should generally stick to the rules when at all possible. Seriously, the 3.5 DMG and DMG2 say this explicitly.<br/><br/>Where does this continuum of GM-power fit into this discussion? Are HERO and GURPS essentially a cop-out, hedging bets against their massive crunch providing "fun" by telling the GM he can push the game wherever it needs to go? Is BW/BE an inherently better design because it's on the other end, distributing authority, supposedly eliminating the needs for much, if any, GM intervention? Are "lite" systems that amount to little more than "die mechanic + GM fills in everything else" a bunch of crap?<br/><br/>I find I'm re-examining my whole outlook on this stuff as a result of that ENWorld thread.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Marco points out the important thing, which is that, once again, we have this undefined term. So we have two choices, either we can define it for purposes of discussion, or we can look at all the myriad things that people use the term for.<br/>
<br/>
Bowing to local pressure here not to make up Jargon, let's look at the uses. I think those have been covered generally by saying it's GM authority to create used when the rules do not constrain him. That takes several sub-forms, listed above. The use is, I agree with Marco, often meant to be negative, because otherwise people don't pay attention to it - GM authority is just an accepted part of RPGs (along with player authority where it exists). So, sure, you can say that any GM use of Authority is Fiat, but that only equates the two.<br/>
<br/>
Which is not to say that people don't use the term in a way that means something non-problematic. Simply that it's a common use that makes it a subset of authority when it's used in this negative fashion.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that the important thing to do, as I tried above, is to ignore these definitions, and to look at the underlying phenomena. And that basic split has been caught above - either the GM is using his authority in a way that's acceptable, or he isn't (the proposed Discretion/Fiat split).<br/>
<br/>
If he's using it acceptably, then this is just "what GMs do" or authority, to use the Forge Jargon for it. This is non-problematic, and I don't think it's worth worrying about.<br/>
<br/>
If it's being used unacceptably, now we have something to discuss, because now we can look at the reasons why it's not acceptable. I somewhat agree that it's related to "railroading" under two conditions. First, as I've said previously, that's an ill defined term under most circumstances. But if we define railroading locally and broadly as taking away player ability to add to the game creatively, then this is, indeed, pretty clearly one of the big problems with "Fiat" taken in it's negative connotation. Marco is correctly identifying it in this role above.<br/>
<br/>
But I'd also posit that this is not the only case where negative use of authority can occur. For example, a GM can use his authority to make a player - not the character, but the player - look bad. To use the instantly classice Rhino's on Ice example, the GM might say, "Ah, too bad, the river is frozen solid to the bottom. The rhinos charge you unabated. That was a silly plan." Yes, actually by the Big Model, this means that the player is also being denied the ability to be creative, but that's a subset of the social level problem that's going on in this case.<br/>
<br/>
But I think that the larger problem is when the GM overextends his authority beyond the expected limits. As has been stated above, when the GM voids rules that the players want upheld. I think we can all agree that this is a violation of the social contract that agrees as to what the rules of play are. Technically a form of cheating (if that can be applied to non-competitive situations). This is non-controversial, everyone agrees this is bad.<br/>
<br/>
The "hazy" area here is when the rules explicitly give the GM the authority to change the rules. Seen most typically in the "Golden Rule" stated something like, "If the GM thinks the rules aren't working, discard them, and rule by fiat." Now, in theory, a GM can improve the game by voiding the rules if/when they don't work. The problem with this is that, in fact, the games that have this "meta-rule" (if you will), rarely, if ever, give any but the most vague guidance on using it. Meaning that, as said above as well, players may not have a good idea of when the rules will be voided, or why. Essentially, if the GM does this quite a bit, then the player's understanding of the rules will be that "It's all GM fiat." Even if the rules are followed in, say 80% of situations that seem to demand them, 20% voidance puts enough uncertainty into the picture that players cannot rely on the rules, and will, instead, be trying to determine what the GM will do with their input.<br/>
<br/>
Now, even this can be functional - after all, "Freeform" play is, in fact, all GM authority being used sans guidelines, all the time. But the point is that this is only good if the players want a freeform game, or something akin to it. The trouble is that the game presents all of these rules as though they're good for play, but then the feeling is that they're not really being used.<br/>
<br/>
I'm speaking from experience here, experience with Storyteller System, in fact. Where I, at times, would wonder why I even had a character sheet. In part because of the railroading, but also because the rules would be tossed out or ignored quite frequently. And the Storyteller, when I questioned him about it, would point to the Golden Rule.<br/>
<br/>
There might be some rate at which one can feel that small, judicious uses of the Golden Rule aren't making all of the other rules moot. But for me, and for many others, I suspect, even small amounts of use seem detrimental to the agreement to play by some set of rules. In fact, I prefer playing freeform than to pretending to be using a set of rules, when in fact we're playing by "GM Fiat."<br/>
<br/>
To be clear, what the golden rule does is make all rules like this:<br/>
<br/>
1. Roll to hit (unless the GM thinks that he knows better, and just decides what happens).<br/>
2. Roll for damage (unless the GM just decides what happens).<br/>
3. Apply damage (unless the GM just decides what happens).<br/>
<br/>
Even if the GM doesn't decide this, if he has unlimited power to do so, and does it even once, it all feels like freeform. The rules cease to be concretely informative of play.<br/>
<br/>
In Universalis, we realized that sometimes people will want to change the rules of a game. I'm not against that, contrary to what it might seem. To that extent, we put in a rule that limits how the player can change the rules in terms of currency, and put in a method for the players to discuss the change, and impose their own wills about it. This throws the decision back to the social level of play, allowing everyone to ratify any changes made to the rules.<br/>
<br/>
This is very different than not changing the rules, but temporarily voiding them whenever one likes. Its the difference between a paricipatory democracy, and a dictatorship. Sure there were laws in Stalinist Russia, but did Stalin have to follow them? OK, that's slanted. But even in the most enlightened dictatorship the rule of law is damaged by having somebody who can void it at will. To say nothing of the potential of power to corrupt.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, RPGs aren't governments, and there are differences in how this applies. But I think that when people are talking about "GM Fiat" as a problem, they are often talking about this particular sort of problem.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I'm sure there are other forms of abuse and misuse of authority that can occur. But I think that these are the most common.<br/>

<br/>
On the subject of design, if a rule granting fiat powers is put in because the designer knows that the system has big problems in execution, and "GM just decides" is thrown in to fix the problem, that's bad design. All RPGs have GM authority to make certain decisions (in fact, I've contended that this is what makes them separate from CRPGs), and setting those levels of authority by rule where they work is good design. It's only when you cover for bad design with GM authority that it's bad.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, what "works" or doesn't work is subjective, so you can't say definitively when authority is being used to cover. But, of course, people will have their opinions on the subject, and rightly so, I think. It might be better to say in a particular case something like, "The design should have been like X here so that it didn't have to rely on GM authority in this case."<br/>

                            Well, as I tried to indicate, this is actually quite common, and just "What the GM does" in many games.<br/>
<br/>
Take for example the question of when to invoke a resolution system as the classic example. Often there's a guideline that says, "Don't do it for minor stuff like crossing streets, or tying shoes. Only for when it seems like it'd be interesting to have a possible failure." That's a classic place where the GM is given authority without any hard rule, but where it's informed at least to some extent by the text at hand.<br/>
<br/>
Don't get me wrong, too, by "sans guidelines" I was saying without any textual "rules" that amount to guidance. Instead in freeform, these "rules" of guidance are negotiated constantly between the participants. This is why Ron says that it's the form of play with the most "points of contact." Meaning you're always figuring out how to do things with every action, instead of having some more stable guidelines in place, or mechanical structures related to the decisions to inform the decisions.<br/>
<br/>
With a mechanical resolution system, for instance, you have an idea of the sorts of things that can be resolved by the system, and this informs you about when it can be used. In early D&amp;D, the only resolution systems were for combat, so if you wanted to resolve a question of whether or not somebody got lost on the way to the dungeon, you had to use GM authority - the resolution system available wouldn't help in this case. So from examples of use, the nature of the mechanics, etc, you get guidance on how to use the discretion given to you as a GM.<br/>
<br/>
Other classic cases of GM discretion to add to resolution use determination:<br/>
- Scene framing - that is, what shows up where and when. In D&amp;D, actually, the "wandering monster" rules made this mechanical. But in most RPGs today (even recent D&amp;D versions), who shows up and when is entirely at GM discretion. This is, perhaps, the most important case of GM authority, as it can be used to over-ride anything else when done right. Want to kill the party? Have a huge fast monster show up. Then the combat system won't save them. Often times the system gives the least amount of guidance on this, with only some vague advice about making it fun and exciting. Though with My Life With Master, there are some very strict guidelines for how to set up scenes (which give much of this power to the players, in fact).<br/>
- Modifier Use - is the character uphil from another? Again, with a system that has miniatures, these things are likely taken out of the hands of the GM. But in many systems whether or not a character is possessed of an advantage or disadvantage is a matter of GM discretion. Put "skill availability" under here, with the notion that a -100% modifier to using a particuar skill is the same in many systems as simply saying "no, you can't use that here." There's often quite a lot of mechanical and informal guidance on how to do this, but it remains a judgment call.<br/>
- NPC actions - simply "role-playing" the NPCs, the GM usually uses his authority to decide what would be interesting for them to do. Yet again, in some early RPGs, this was taken out of the GM's hands with "reaction rolls" and such. More recent systems have all sorts of potential mechanical guidance on how discretion is to be used in these cases.<br/>
<br/>
I could go on, but you get the idea. The GM has tons of discretion in almost any TT RPG. As Marco says, however, it's a question of when it's informed by the logic of the game that's been agreed to be played, or if the GM is simply trying to figure it out from first principles based on nothing but his own whim.<br/>

                            GM Fiat is not the GM being the GM.  If we go down that route, the very term GM Fiat is useless.  GM Fiat means a specific subset of actions taken by GMs which is worthy of comment and giving a name.  So GM Fiat is not the GM exercising his duly recognized authority.  That's called Being the GM.  GM Fiat is something that GMs do that maybe supports and maybe detracts from Being the GM.  Throwing our hands up and saying, "Man, everything the GM does is GM Fiat!" is pointless.                        </div>

                            I'm with Mike--who is with me ... so it's, like, recursive or something. <br/><br/>Elliot coined a term that I can't find right now about GMing with an agenda (intentional GMing? That wasn't it). Anyway it was about having a specific agenda vs. just "running the world." I think that's relevant here. If the GM has something in mind when he says "Sure you can try--but at -10!" (in a 3d6 system) and isn't doing it because the attempt is clearly nigh-on-impossible, then it may well be a case of GM fiat.<br/><br/>I think there is an interesting gray-zone where the GM is doing things to do things to increase the drama like:<br/>* raising the stakes<br/>* enforcing consequences in a stringent manner<br/>* creating coincidences that will move things towards climax (but not dictating the nature of it)<br/><br/>These are things that are done "by GM Fiat" that we normally think of as viable in a Narrativist game--which is an important term here since Force kills Narrativism (by definition) so these uses of "GM Fiat" cannot be Force (and, look, I know the terminology sucks but there it is). So this means that:<br/>(a) Either GM Fiat is simply Force--the use of GM Authority to remove agency from the players.<br/>(b) GM Fiat is *not* the same as Force but is some other phenomena that is still distinct from simple GM Authority.<br/><br/>I think that (a) is pretty much true which is why saying stuff like "Traditional Games run on GM Fiat!" is insulting to traditional games. But I think a case can be made for (b) if it's done carefully.<br/><br/>-Marco                        </div>

                            I actually brought up "player fiat" in an RPGnet thread a couple weeks ago, when I used it to describe decisions that players expect to be responsible for under traditional GM-Player setups. I think my examples were like "What do you do?" (taking this away leads to loss of player agency a.k.a. "deprotagonism") and other things related to a player's control over their own character. I'd suggest that player fiat can be equally arbitrary and unfair, but is generally more manageable because of the stronger social limits on individual player authority.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>I don't know if "high-crunch" games really<em>require</em>that sort of GM Fiat, Lucian.  In my experience, most high-crunch games are high-crunch in specific, highlighted areas (usually combat, sometimes vehicle design, sometimes setting-construction) and are relatively low-crunch for everything else, but still have some mechanical support for things that fall outside of the focused material.  Of course, my reference points for this are GURPS (rule for everything) and World of Darkness (high-crunch supernatural, low-crunch day-to-day).<br/><br/>Can you give me a specific example / AP to help me understand what you're getting at, Lucian?</blockquote>
OK, hopefully I won't derail the conversation by harking back to the much earlier bits of it, but let's see if I can explain what I was talking about.<br/><br/>In the 'rhinos on ice' scenario, in most of the games I play, there would be an assumption that someone should roll some dice to see if they break through or not.  But as a GM, I would almost certainly not be able to turn to Table 6.27b:  Land Mammals And Their Effects On River Ice, to figure out what to roll so instead I would have to make up a rule or a target number of something.<br/><br/>Here's a bit of Actual Play from a 7th Sea game (from an online transcript; Sebastien is a player narrating what he wants to do; I'm the GM):
<blockquote>Sebastien retreats back across the slippery patch of wall, trying to lure the wolf forward, then lunges to try and knock it off the wall.<br/><br/>GM asks, "You bastard, what do I roll for that?" </blockquote>
So I made up something for him to roll for his plan, which would give him a bonus to a second roll to attack, and he rolled and succeeded and everyone was happy.  This being 7th Sea, had he failed the roll, if he had really cared about it, he could have spent some drama dice to make it succeed.<br/><br/>So perhaps instead of 'high-crunch games', I should have said, 'games in which it is expected that you will roll dice for most every important conflict/attempt.'<br/><br/>(These would be examples of what you termed 'GM Discretion', but without specific system support.)                        </div>

                            Sometimes I forget about task resolution games.  Seriously, this is becoming a problem for me in discussing games.

My initial, knee-jerk response to the rhinos scenario is just to roll the player's tactics or something to see if their clever plan worked; rolling for the ice or the rhinos doesn't even <em>occur</em> to me.  Same for the wolf: I'd just have the guy roll Leaping or whatever and have his clever strategem be the color describing his attempt.  I'm not saying these are the obvious answers; I'm saying I've got a blind spot when it comes to these sorts of set-ups.<br/><br/>Must think.                        </div>

Joshua, this is <em>exactly</em> what got me into such a kerfuffle on the ENWorld thread. I was trying to argue that GM Fiat is more an artifact of task resolution. In D&amp;D, e.g., "getting what I want" is never really addressed by the mechanics, save for very specific, micro-level stuff: "Did I hit him?" Ergo, it falls to the realm of DM-player negotiation... or just plain DM fiat. In a game like BWr, I just don't see it as much of an issue, because the die roll is determining--right then and there--whether I'm getting what I want. Stakes/intent have already been set, etc.<br/><br/>Task resolution just doesn't work, I think, without GM Fiat. The question is whether you're playing in (as Mike put it) a democracy or a tyranny, and which one of those the text is pointing towards before play even starts.                        </div>

Well, there's another angle that you and Joshua are not covering here; D&amp;D and numerous other games, as far as I know, don't even address the question of "what I, as a player, want". There is no stake-setting from players point of view as the view itself is not supported - task resolution, by it's nature, does not take players wants into account. Task resolution happens in the context of the character, resolving if the character succeeds in what he attempts. The question of player goals is a production of conflict resolution, or vice versa. The problem with D&amp;D and numerous other systems is that they do not, in any way, address the player/character viewpoint difference and happily let players wander in the dark, either working within the context of character or working with player goals, though with no support. Conflict resolution-based games tend to sidestep the problem by focusing solely on player viewpoint (whereas immersive playing tends to sidestep the problem by attempting to remove the player point of view and working only within the context of character).<br/><br/>But yes, in the end, task resolution-based games tend to lean towards GM Fiat and could end up falling flat to their faces because they don't address the player/character divide and furthermore do pretty poor job on resolving the actual task if it's not combat. "Traditional" Roleplaying games, in general, do a very poor job on telling players what they are supposed to do and tend give the GM a free ticket for Fiat if he wants to.<br/><br/>(I'm not familiar with task resolution mechanics that do address player point of view, though there are bound to be some)                        </div>

Probably very true; I'll have to confess that I'm not familiar with too many of them. Care to mention some examples? The addressing of player/character viewpoint in them should be intresting.                        </div>

                            Yeah, on reflection, that particular but common set up where the GM determines the resolution of conflicts based on the aggregate successes and failures of discrete tasks... that seems relatively GM Fiaty to me.  Because the GM is asked to make the leap from "what happened" to "what it means."<br/><br/>This is very easily compounded when combined with unlimited GM "budget" which is also an unexamined element of traditional designs.  Cause if the GM can always throw in another orc between you and the switch (more fiat), the GM can constantly recontextualize the conflict to make the aggregate successes and failures say whatever she wants it to say.<br/><br/>So I think I stand by my original assertion: when the provided rules look to the GM to make a decision and does not give guidelines on how to make that decision, it's GM Fiat.                        </div>

                            General ramblings:<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so I'm going to run Beyond the Mountains of Madness, a CoC campaign. Session one was character generation, nothing else. One item on the to-do list was: Ask players what level of GM Fiat they want for this campaign.<br/>
<br/>
Now, this was tied up in two other variables -- Script Immunity and Railroading.<br/>
<br/>
So, I asked, did folks want "The dice rule, no fudging"? "Keep PCs alive and winning, no matter what, even though it's Coc"? "Losing is fine so long as we go down in flames"?<br/>
<br/>
That last was the popular winner. This works with the campaign as written, in that the authors don't really want the PCs dropping until they actually get to the climax of the adventure. So, yes, there are things I will fiat -- if necessary -- to keep things on the path we've discussed. Those last two words are very important.<br/>
<br/>
I'm also going to be running Tatters of the King, but as part of my homebrew Cthluhupunk game, which means I will turn it inside out and upside down. I was annoyed when I first read it -- great set pieces, but lousy stitching between them. On a reread, it does improve, as I spot "You can also do X" and "If this actually interests your players, otherwise..."<br/>
<br/>
But, the stitching is still weaker than I'd like. Someone's fiat, maybe the author's, makes the links between some lovely, lovely bits boil down to, "There is no way that the PCs can do anything until they get a letter, and hunt down the obscure reference in this way." I was joking about it with Josh (Joshua Kronengold, that is), and our dialogue went something like this:<br/>
<br/>
Lisa: So, you wait until you get a letter telling you to follow this guy on such-and-such a night.<br/>
<br/>
Josh: I want to break in.<br/>
<br/>
Lisa: Nope, you can't do that. His place is tightly locked up -- fences and stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Josh: What if I'm a burglar?<br/>
<br/>
Lisa: Nope, it says it's tightly locked up.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Now, it isn't truly quite that bad. I am sure the author would have no problem with a gm letting the PCs break in so long as the shape of things remains intact -- which is another form of railroading and fiat. If I'm running this kind of Traditional CoC campaign, there are set pieces that I probably want the PCs to get to, and I've probably cleared it with my players ahead of time.<br/>
<br/>
Either that, or I've decided the heck with that, and see how the PCs wreck the scenario. Is that GM fiat, too?<br/>
<br/>
As for "You bastard, I don't know what kind of roll to call for", I've gotten used to dumping that back on the player. "So, um, make your, um, manipulate wolf roll. You tell me what you think that is." It does help that I use OTE rules for most things. (In fact, BTMOM will be the first time I'm using CoC rules.)<br/>
<br/>
But, yah, GM Fiat is A Thing. Give me the context.<br/>
<br/>
And it's sneaky, it is. When I ran Sorcerer, I resisted the urge to fudge die rolls. But, as one of my players pointed out, deciding when and how many bonus dice to award is another kind of GM Fiat. As is deciding when rolls are required.<br/>

Probably very true; I'll have to confess that I'm not familiar with too many of them. Care to mention some examples?

<blockquote>So I think I stand by my original assertion: when the provided rules look to the GM to make a decision and does not give guidelines on how to make that decision, it's GM Fiat.</blockquote>How specific do the guidelines have to be? Will any guidelines do, or only certain kinds?<br/><br/>Buzz has pointed to GURPS GMing guidelines and frankly I remember the 3e guidelines as having some pretty crappy crap in them. "When in doubt, roll and shout" stands out in my mind--basically telling the GM to roll a bunch of dice at the climactic moment, and then declare that the PCs' plan succeeds. <i>Everway</i> essentially embeds three "philosophies of GMing" into the rules: the Law of Fortune, the Law of Drama, and the Law of Karma.<br/><br/>(Confusingly, Ron Edwards took these terms and repurposed them so that, in Forge terms, both the Law of Drama and the Law of Karma are what would be called "Drama resolution" today. Or possibly the Law of Karma would be considered "Dressed-up Fiat" since it allows the use of numerical factors to determine an outcome, but only if the GM decides to go that way, and with the GM choosing the factors to be used. Karma in Everway is basically "impartial" GMing which takes into account whatever factors are appropriate--numerical or situational--without the use of any random element.)<br/><br/>Now, Everway is pretty vague on providing a meta-philosophy to guide the GM on picking which Law to use. But suppose you looked at each one separately, effectively breaking Everway into three variants. IIRC the Law of Drama says "Do whatever's best for the story". Is that a good guideline? (I don't think so.) Yet other games incorporate similar guidelines, at least in part. E.g. Dogs has "Escalate, escalate, escalate!"; Sorcerer tells the GM to think about climactic scenes and to throw out Bangs in ways that allow the character to Address Premise. In short, some kinds of "motivated GMing" do work. (In general; of course some people don't like those games.)                        </div>

Is this because the purpose of <em>Feng Shui</em> is genre emulation? I.e., the whole point is to be just like an HK action film, ergo, so anything that gets in the way of that needs to be edited out. IOW, it's game where, even as a player, you want to follow the script so it turns out "right".                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>The "hazy" area here is when the rules explicitly give the GM the authority to change the rules.</blockquote>
And here's another hazy area, which I've hinted at in my last couple posts. It's when the rules explicitly give the GM the final say <i>on anything</i>, without providing consistent guidelines that the group, as whole, considers intelligible. I do not know Amber, but the Law of Karma in Everway is likely subject to this criticism: when working according to the Law of Karma, the GM is supposed to decide what happens based on a wholistic analysis of the situation, generally foregrounding numerical characteristics of the PCs, and sometimes including metaphysical laws of the multiverse such as "payback is a bitch" when PCs behave badly. Most or many (so-called) task resolution systems work similarly--or if the guidelines aren't in the book, many people choose to employ similar ones. You can see it on the ENWorld thread (and also in an earlier thread we had over on theRPGsite on Conflict Resolution): quite a few people do not see a need for explicit, mechanical Conflict Resolution because they already interpret "traditional task resolution rules" to include a presumption of GM fairness or impartiality in determining the final effect of success/failure in a task roll.<br/><br/>Edited to add: Yet I have a sense that, for quite a few people, either this interpretation is unfamiliar (and therefore not taken for granted at all) or unintelligible (there's no such thing as fairness and impartiality, even as a goal we can strive for).                        </div>

I can't speak to <em>Sorcerer</em> (it's in the mail, though), but in BWr, isn't the fact that the player and GM input is a) relatively equal, b) hashed out before any dice are rolled, and c) can be short-circuited by the player ("Those stakes are too high; I'm not doing it") mean that there really isn't GM fiat in the all-powerful sense of a D&amp;D or GURPS GM? In BWr, the results stand, no matter what; there's none of the recontextualizing you can pull in many trad games.<br/><br/>IOW, isn't what you describe in playing <em>Sorcerer</em> just "What the GM does," in Mike's sense of the phrase, and not "GM Fiat"?                        </div>

                            Is what I describe "What the GM does"?<br/><br/>Well, that depends on how we're defining "GM Fiat".<br/><br/>If I'm setting the difficulty, in any traditional system, sure, one way, it's "What the GM does". But, if every time you try to have your PC do something that breaks my script, I assign absurdly high difficulty numbers, and we don't have a pre-game agreement about this, I'm pushing it bigtime.<br/><br/>Oversimplifying greatly:<br/><br/>In <i>Sorcerer</i>, let's say your PC tries a snapshot banish, which, as I recall, means you are rolling a number of dice equal to your Humanity plus 1. (If I'm wrong, it's just your Humanity.) Let's say your Humanity is 5, so you are rolling 6 dice, and we're using d10s.<br/><br/>You have not done a Punish, aka a way to make the demon weaker, so the demon is rolling, what, Power plus Lore plus Binding strength, maybe plus 5 dice? Let's call it 10 dice. Could be a lot more. Could be less, too, but here, it's 10d10.<br/><br/>To up your odds, you need bonus dice. Lots of bonus dice. This can boil down to your skill as a player in convincing the GM to give them to you. This is not something specific to <i>Sorcerer</i>; many systems have a large Fast Talk the GM factor, <i>Amber</i> being a bit notorious for it.<br/><br/>If I'm handing you 3 dice for a roleplaying bonus, you get a much better chance than if I hand you one die.<br/><br/>One or 3, handing out bonus dice is What the GM Does.<br/><br/>But, by choosing the number, I'm heading into the gray area of possible fiat. There is no objective measurement for the roleplaying bonus.<br/><br/>Now, I'm not saying this is good or bad. And, there are many combinations and variables -- I'm oversimplifying to something both basic and mushy. I am saying that, even while I am avoiding Fiat by not outright fudging die rolls, I am using my power as GM to sway the odds based on a criteria that cannot be objectively measured and that will vary depending on my desires -- conscious or subconscious -- for the outcome and on the players' ability to read me, rather than the game situation.<br/><br/>Fiat? Not Fiat? Depends on definitions, context, and degree. By my definition, I think it is Fiat, but I am not sure that my definition is particularly useful here, on this forum, as opposed to in my games, when I say, "Okay, guys, what level of Fiat are we all comfortable with?"<br/><br/>-Lisa Padol                        </div>

Since, in your example, dice are still being rolled, I veer away from calling it GM fiat, especially if the amount of bonus dice being handed out is within a guideline lain out in the ruleset. The group is still essentially relying on the mechanics to determine the outcome.<br/><br/>Granted, if the GM was modifying the roll in such an egregious way that the roll was pointless, then I'd be calling it fiat.<br/><br/>Anyway, I see your point. I nonetheless think that we're in the "GM decision informed by the rule text" territory Mike outlined earlier.                        </div>

                            Yeah, what Buzz said. If, in fact, the GM says, "20 bonus dice!" for that, then, yeah, he'd be using fiat? Why? Because that's out of the bounds of what the game says you can give for a bonus.<br/>
<br/>
Without being the least bit silly, let's look at the words Fiat and Dictator for a moment. Fiat is from Latin as if "Fiat Lux" which translates "Let there be light." Which is what god says in Genesis in Latin bibles. It's a term for what those with unbrideled power do to effect things.<br/>
<br/>
In the Roman Republic, the "Dictator" meant, unsurprisingly, "Speaker." This is where we get he modern "Speaker of the House." It means, literally, "he who speaks for all of us." That is, in the Roman Republic, a dictator was a person elected by the senate to take complete power in times of emergency. Because, in such times, the decision-making process of a body like the Senate merely takes to much time, and leads to conflicting purposes. Which, if it leads to your destruction, is more of an evil than giving complete power to a single individual.<br/>
<br/>
But only if that individual then gives the power back. And doesn't assume the power in the first place without the consent of the people. Julius Ceasar was elected dictator, but then asked to stand down. He refused. And thus the Republic died, and the Empire was born.<br/>
<br/>
In an RPG, if a rule change is made by a leader with the informed consent of those ruled, there is potential value in this method of doing things. If the players in a RPG are releasing the GM to make a rule change, then all is well. If, OTOH, the players allow the GM to rule by Fiat, to do as he wishes, voiding any rule whenever he sees fit...even if the rules change is made for the supposed good of the players...then you have an Emperor, not a Republican Dictator.<br/>
<br/>
Now, does the guideline "for the good of the game" constitute a rule that sufficiently limits when the GM can be a dictator? Or does it enable him to be an emperor? I think, at best, it allows him to be an enlightened emperor. Because there is no limit set on the power that allows for players to challenge this authority. As Elliot points out, often this encoding is complete in the rules. "GM is final arbiter, and what he says goes, no matter what" makes the GM the emperor over the game.<br/>
<br/>
Which, again, is not to say that an game run by an Enlightened Emperor can't be fun for some players. But it is Fiat at that point. And where players don't want Fiat, where they're complaining about it, this is the general point at which the problem begins.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, other games give wide open authority to the GM with regards to limited decisions, sans much guidelines. This, too, will be a place where Fiat is claimed. Basically it's a matter of "checks and balances." Is the GM being forced by the social contract to play by a set of rules agreed to, or is he being given authority to act at whim?<br/>
<br/>
Again, it's not so much that the GM will make bad decisions that makes Fiat bad - that makes it worse when it happens, sure. But Fiat is bad, simply because when playing a RPG some of us like to be bound by the rules of play, including all participants, including the GM.<br/>
<br/>
I do, for the same reason I like living in a country where "might makes right" has been replaced by the rule of law.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lisa, good luck with the Mountains of Madness...I think you're a tad crazy to even be attempting it. I think you'll find that, to make it work, you have to use a metric buttload of Fiat. Since it's basically a script, which does precisely the sort of thing from your example that should make Josh scream at some point, "I'm losing my agency." (I recall one particular point where it says something like, "The PCs then take chase after the sound on their sleds." As though there's no other possible response to the scene input. And one part near the climax where it actually gives Magician's Force advice to ensure that a particular scene has a particular ending to it. There are even scenes where the PCs are assumed to fail without rolls, like the one where there's nothing they can do to prevent the sea plane from getting damaged.)<br/>
<br/>
If it were a short script, then you could probably come up with ways to dance around it, and allow at least some player agency. But, since it represents a couple dozen sessions of play (at over 400 pages of script), unless you're willing to ignore hundreds of pages of the script, you have to stick to it like glue to make it work. No, I haven't attempted it, but I know a guy who ran it for Tom Back and gang, and his report was that my expectations were correct.<br/>

                            I had an incident in my roleplaying group a while back, where I lost my temper with the guy who was running a D&amp;D game and making what seeed to be arbitrary rules-changes. Specifically, I was trying to cast a spell, which after I had spent the whole turn-order reading up on to make sure I got it right (being very NOT versed in D&amp;D magic), I announced it and he decided he wanted it to work a different way. One where I had to make a roll to pull off my stunt, where the spell as written just <i>happens</i>, no to-hit or anything. (It was Flaming Sphere, and I wanted to place it between my fello PC and the guys he was fleeing from. DM wanted me to roll percentile to time and place it properly, almost like a to-hit roll.)<br><br>The next week, we got together to discuss the incident, starting with my apology for losing my cool. It turns out that the "real reason" for the odd ruling, was that since we had travelled back in time to an era where magic is more potent, the sphere would be bigger, and depending on the exact placement I could end up hurting my friend as well as the monsters. My contesting the ruling put him in an impossible position, because the potency of magic was his big surprise for everyone, and my first spellcasting since the time travel was the "big reveal." So since he couldn't come out and say what the real deal was, he had to lie, basically. Heck, all he said when I first announced the action was, "you can try." It took several exchanges of conversation to even get "roll percentile for timing and placement" out of him. In any case, he could have just said "there's something going on you're not aware of, roll percentile," or even rolled percentile himself, and I wouldn't have blown my top (not that my behavior was excusable). "Magic is more potent because we traveled back in time" is an acceptable rules-tweak to me, he's not breaking the game or anything, it's an interesting situational twist not covered by the rules. But when he pulls out all this "well, they're moving targests, so you have to judge the timing and distance exactly, so you've got to roll" BS, when the D&amp;D movement and combat rules <i>simpley don't work that way</i>, that torques me off. I mean, he would have to apply that standard to every action in the game to be consistent--<i>everyone</i> is "really" in motion all the <i>time</i> in a fight, but in game terms we all take turns moving and attacking, etc.<br><br>One thing voiced by several people during the group chat (in repsonse to my contention that the GM should keep things "above board" and basically play by the rules we've agreed to, not whatever rules are happening to swim through his head at the moment), was the question, "don't you trust the GM?" 'Cause, you know, the GM just wants a fun game, right? He's not <i>trying</i> to screw you over, right? So you should give him the benefit of the doubt, wait and see where he's going with it, air objections after session, etc. The whole thing had a wierd social pressure air to it, like I'm not being a good friend if I question the GM. I've been thinking about it ever since (it's been like a month and a half), and I think I put my finger on something valuable.<br><br>See, on the one hand, I think a very real response to "don't you trust the GM?" is often simply "no." Some GMs I <i>don't</i> trust to not be dicks. In fact, one of the guys in the room (the first to ask the "trust" question, I think) had DMed a game a few years ago where those of us who played felt very dicked around. One of the other players preaching "trust," when she was playing under this DM, was feeling particularly screwed-over, all the time, and extremely frustrated about it. And the current DM (the one I blew up at), while not the same as the other guy, seems to run a pretty restrictive game (all his "rulings" or judgment calls seem to be about what you <i>can't</i> do), and has a pretty guarded personality, to where I <i>can't</i> say for certain that he won't be a dick. But even aside from all that, here's what I put my finger on: <i>there's more than one kind of trust.</i> There's "I trust you not to be intentionally mean/selfich/manipulative," and then there's "I trust you to skilfully run a game in such a way as to help provide an enjoyable experience for me." Basically "I trust your <i>character</i>" vs. "I trust your <i>ability</i>."<br><br>This is important for me personally, because whether or not this DM is a dick, he's definitely not displaying the <i>ability</i> to run what for me is a fun game. With this understanding, perhaps I can have success in communicating "the way you're playing isn't fun for me" without it getting wrapped up in "you're a jerk." This is also important in general, I think, because a lot of roleplayers, when confronted with something like Mike's excellent post above, will respond with something like, "well, sure, if a GM's a jerk it's a problem, but our guy's not like that." Witness the ENworld thread: "sounds like you're just describing bad GMing." However, if we can move beyond the "that's a jerky thing to do" level (which can certainly be true!) and get to the "regardless of motive, running a game in this way can be detrimental in the following ways, so perhaps developing <i>this</i> set of skills for GMing instead would be better" level of discussion, then maybe we can make some progress in this issue.<br><br>Peace,<br>-Joel                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Okay, so if "GM Fiat" is use of GM authority in excess of the "necessary" standard GM task stuff, I have another question? How does GM Fiat differ from "GM Force"?<br>
<br>
Lisa, BtMoM is, like most published CoC campaigns, the epitome of railroading. My advice would be to be up front with the players that this is the case, that their decisions don't actually have much impact on the predefined storyline, and that this is more about getting into character, successfully seeking out and jumping through the hoops of story-exposing skill rolls, and experiencing the horror of each scene. Draw back the illusionist curtain, so to speak. If they get all cold feet when you tell them this, well, better than playing bait-and-switch and insulting their intelligence.                        </br></br></div>

Looking over at RandwomWiki and the Forge glossary, I'm not sure there's much of a difference:
<blockquote><cite>From the Forge Provisional Glossary</cite>The Technique of control over characters' thematically-significant decisions by anyone who is not the character's player. When Force is applied in a manner which disrupts the Social Contract, the result is Railroading. Originally called "GM-oomph" (Ron Edwards), then "GM-Force" (Mike Holmes).</blockquote>
RandomWiki says: "It is considered an awkward term by Ron Edwards because of (1) its sense of imposed mandate and strength-in-control, and (2) its parodic Star Wars connotation." <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            Mike, Larry -- I've read several write ups of BTMOM, and a few discussions on the order of, "Y'know, if the players are good enough to do X, fuck the script." So, I'm not too worried about that. And, I have talked with the players. The general consensus is, "Well, what else does one expect from a CoC game?" with various riders we've discussed. So, the curtain is definitely drawn back.<br>
<br>
40 pages or 400 makes no difference. This is what I do.<br>
<br>
That is, I look at the bleeding edge of rpgs, and I take what I need. Sometimes, I learn what I knew but didn't know I knew, if you see what I mean, and that's really helpful.<br>
<br>
I have taken dozens of commercial scenarios and run them. Not always well -- the point about different kinds of trust is excellent. Over the years, I've gotten good at taking a published scenario, dissecting it, moving around the organs, inserting other things, and then running it. I've gotten better at spotting where and how a scenario is likely to break for my group, and fixing it. And, fixing sometimes means deciding that the players can run rampant over it.<br>
<br>
I'm not on the bleeding edge, or, I think, anywhere near it.<br>
<br>
Currently, I'm looking at two interesting campaigns -- Tatters of the King and Beyond the Mountains of Madness. For Tatters, I'm planning to turn it inside out and upside down and make it part of my ongoing Cthluhupunk campaign. I'm using OTE rules, not CoC, and if it breaks, fine. I've got to rant about that book at some point. Lovely set pieces for the CoC fan, and weak stitching that really mars the scenario.<br>
<br>
BTMOM is the first thing I'm actually going to run as CoC. I expect it will be bumpy. I expect that all of us talking after sessions will help. And, it will make a very interesting comparison with what I'm hoping to do with Tatters of the King.<br/>

                            Excellent thread -- wish I'd seen it earlier.<br/>
<br/>
I think it's important for a gaming group to know whether or not the GM is going to be secretly invoking "Rule Zero" to change/diregard the rules to "make the game more fun" for the group -- or if the GM is going to play the game by the books (meaning without any "rule zero" even if it's in the book).<br/>
<br/>
Players deserve to know whether their game "may contain traces of" secret rule changing/disregarding, dice fudging, and "illusionism" techniques.  If they're okay with those things, then no problem.<br/>
<br/>
For new games, a better "rule zero" would be:  any rule in the game can be changed or disregarded as long as all the players in the game agree to it, and it remains in effect for the entire game.                        </div>
