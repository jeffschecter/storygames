We took on The Dragon, which in our instance was a Wolf from Hell here to devour the Earth.<br/><br/>We defended a village by convincing Ellis, the sole survivor of a previous attack, to wield a magic sword powered by his will to protect the innocent.<br/><br/>We found the beast's weakness by finding a sword powered by innocence and letting a twelve-year old, Prior, lead us into battle.  His father Anthos, was not happy with this, but swore to stand at his son's side.<br/><br/>We cornered the beast by facing Ellis, now an enemy of the fellowship, and disrupting a ritual meant to give the wolf even greater power.  Ellis wielded a sword powered by his will to protect, but he had lost that will and the sword was powerless.  Prynn faced him with a sword powered by his need for revenge, but he had overcome that obsession and his sword was likewise drained.  Prynn won and Prior was able to enter the cavern to face the wolf.<br/><br/>The one moment of confusion was when this fight broke out mid-scene, with player characters on one side and non-player characters on the other side.  We wanted to smoothly determine consequences in this scene without waiting for the resolution of the whole challenge.  We kind of resolved this ad-hoc, with proposed actions and consequences being floated.  It worked, but it lacked the smooth flow of the rest of the game.  There were a few exchanges like "I attack.", "He leaps out of the way" that felt like the narrative wasn't moving forward.<br/><br/><b>What I would want to do next time would be to formalize how risky actions like this are resolved:<br/>- The acting character states what they want out of the situation and asks 'what price would I have to pay to achieve this?'<br/>- The others set a price of the proposed action.<br/>-The acting character decides to accept the price or abandon their stated goal.</b><br/><br/>This is, perhaps obviously, taken from the escalation system in Kingdom.  I think it would weave together nicely with scenes in Follow.<br/><br/>I'm wondering if others have had similar stall-outs with GM-less games without in-scene conflict resolution systems and if you have ideas for mitigating them.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb" title="hamnacb"><img alt="hamnacb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">hamnacb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475966/#Comment_475966" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-09T13:51:46+00:00" title="August  9, 2018  1:51PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ive only tried Follow once but it was not a successful session.

There is a \u201cToo easy\u201d mechanic that basically states that if a player tries to achieve something and it seems too easy that another player can say \u201ctoo easy\u201d and then players can suggest a cost, or the like. I think your solution is a good formalized interpretation of that rule. <br/><br/>Try it out next time and let us know how it works. <br/><br/>Your rule is also pretty similar to the \u201cbut, only if...\u201d rule in Polaris. Here\u2019s how the rule works in Polaris:<br/><br/>1. The active player says, \u201cI stab the dragon.\u201d<br/>2. The group says, \u201cbut, only if...your sword gets stuck in the dragons scales.\u201d<br/>3 The active player, \u201cOkay, but only if...[the character who my character is in love with] is impressed with my courage and heroism and sees me in a better light.\u201d <br/>4. The group says, \u201cOkay.\u201d  <br/>This \u201cbut, only if...\u201d mechanic can go back and forth until both sides are satisfied. <br/><br/>Anyway, please let us know how, whatever you end up choosing to use, works out.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476019">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476019/#Comment_476019" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-10T18:40:05+00:00" title="August 10, 2018  6:40PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 10, 2018 6:46PM by Paul_T.">edited August 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are lots of "soft" resolution techniques. <br/><br/>I'm not a huge Follow fan (it's rather freeform for my tastes, and we had some similar issues with moments of conflict/uncertainty when we played it). That said, the lack of resolution procedures is clearly intended as a feature of the game here. It may be worth carefully exploring the way the game is intended to be played (and my impression is that something like the fight choreography you're describing is ultimately not the game's focus at all - best to describe it quickly and move on to the draw of the tokens).<br/><br/>I like the technique described above.<br/><br/>Here are some others:<br/><br/>* As a group, brainstorm two or more possible and plausible outcomes, then randomly choose one (roll dice or draw from the bag).<br/><br/>* "But Only If..." - another player suggests a cost or complication (as in the post above).<br/><br/>* Other players each suggest a possible outcome/consequence; the acting player chooses between them.<br/><br/>* Assign a player (perhaps randomly or arbitrarily) authority over the relevant element of the fiction. They get to decide what happens. <br/><br/>* Consult some oracle - dice, cards, tarot cards, imagery, opening a book to a random page, etc... - and interpret the outcome yourself as you wish.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moconnor" title="moconnor"><img alt="moconnor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/483/n3W81Z19PQYI6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moconnor">moconnor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476028/#Comment_476028" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-10T22:50:55+00:00" title="August 10, 2018 10:50PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 10, 2018 10:57PM by moconnor.">edited August 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think part of the problem was that we needed to be more direct describing our actions for the procedure as written to work.

I'm happy to use the swordfight moments to show my character's resolve or rage or whatever, but in the course of that, he's probably going to try something that'd kill your guy, and we need to have some sort of established way to proceed there.  Because if we just go with our regular verbal habits, one player might narrate something into the fiction that really doesn't work for the other player.<br/><br/>I think some "Yes, and" is necessary, as well as a pause before anyone narrates all the way through from Intent to Initiation to Execution to Effect.  Personally, I find it necessary to let the other player speak between I/I and E/E.  "I try to skewer you!" rather than "I skewer you!"  <br/><br/>When people aren't playing to win, "I try to skewer you!" leaves open the possible response, "You totally skewer me!"  But it also leaves open other possibilities when the other player really doesn't want that to happen for any number of legitimate reasons (plausibility, aesthetics, entertainment, resonance, situation, ability to keep playing your character, etc.).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" title="EmmatheExcrucian"><img alt="EmmatheExcrucian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/892/nSNTGS8B31FGT.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">EmmatheExcrucian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476084/#Comment_476084" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-13T16:43:22+00:00" title="August 13, 2018  4:43PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 13, 2018 4:45PM by EmmatheExcrucian.">edited August 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For resolving situations like combat without resolution mechanics, you generally want to follow the golden rule of freeform which is:<br/>"No one can do something to your character without your consent."<br/>Thus, they can't stab you unless you say they can, they can't charm you unless you say they can, they can't convince your character of something unless you say they can, etc, etc, etc., because absolute control of your character's story is in your hands, and the only things that happen to your character are the ones that suit their story and aesthetics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476085/#Comment_476085" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-13T16:51:25+00:00" title="August 13, 2018  4:51PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 13, 2018 4:52PM by David_Berg.">edited August 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, that's perfect!

When you take a Wound, you either negate what happened, or you reshape what happened however you want. This could be anything from "The bullet didn't hit me because it broke the pendant ocarina hanging around my neck and bounced off" to "I was too durable for it to hurt me" to "I wasn't turned into a frog, but I took on some frog-like qualities like for instance now I want to eat flies and grow gills when I'm in the water" to "My character's girlfriend doesn't really break up with her. She's angry though, and I'm going to have to resolve this situation, but in the end she's going to forgive me."<br/>Then you gain some temporary abilities until the Wound goes away (which takes anywhere from 1/3 of a session to 5 session depending on the severity of what happened, and you can choose to keep a Wound longer because you like the powers it's giving you and find playing up to the Wound interesting and like what it's doing for your character's story in this moment). <br/>You technically have a limited number of Wounds per block of time, but it's a large enough number that you rarely use them all in play before you get some back, so you effectively have as much veto power as you could need, especially since there are several simple ways in play to get more Wound slots if you need them, and to clear away Wounds you've taken. The average character can theoretically veto something like 16 things per session, which is typically far more than you have need to veto (and if you're needing to veto that many things consistently, there's something going horribly wrong that needs to be discussed with the group).<br/>It's super super cool. ^_^                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476098/#Comment_476098" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-13T20:39:13+00:00" title="August 13, 2018  8:39PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, the basic (but often unwritten) freeform rule of "Your Liberty To Swing Your Fist Ends Just Where My Nose Begins" is pretty key for this kind of play.<br/><br/>In IIEE terms, for those who care, basically the target or victim of any action gets to say what the Effect on their character is. You may pursue your Intent, Initiate and Execute an action... but the other person says what the Effect is.<br/><br/>I really like the sound of how Chuubo's handles that, Emma. Sounds like a well thought-out approach to the problem, and with fun outputs, too.<br/><br/>However, games like <i>Follow</i> are also distinct from pure freeform in that they do have specific points of uncertainty/resolution. I think that, in those games, the players need to be mindful of them and consciously drive towards them as they act: "How is what I'm narrating or doing contributing to getting us to the next resolution point?"<br/><br/>I've seen <i>Fiasco</i> fail many times, for instance, because people may forget about that "target" entirely, or, perhaps worse, have different ideas of what it might be. Jason Morningstar writes in the book that "it will be obvious when you try it", but, in my experience, that's not the case for everyone, particularly when people come to the table with different expectations of what "resolution" is for and what it looks like (usually based on previous gaming experience).<br/><br/><i>Follow</i> is better in this sense - it presents a clearer target.<br/><br/>Sometimes, in a game like this, you'll find places where "your freedom to act ends where my nose begins" is too loose ("No, you can't narrate your own character jumping off the boat, because that depends on the beads drawn at the end of the scene") and places where it's too strict ("Sure, you can narrate getting my character expelled from the school - he's not the Primary character and that will make it easier to play out the next scene, anyway").<br/><br/>Getting everyone on the same page about what the decision/resolution points are and building towards them is always key. (It's arguably one of the main skills involved in playing a game like this, in my opinion.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476103/#Comment_476103" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-13T22:34:19+00:00" title="August 13, 2018 10:34PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 13, 2018 10:41PM by David_Berg.">edited August 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, I think I disagree on the IIEE -- I'd err on the side of enlisting the victim for Execution -- but perhaps it depends on where you draw the Initiation/Execution line case by case.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476106/#Comment_476106" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-13T22:45:38+00:00" title="August 13, 2018 10:45PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 13, 2018 10:47PM by David_Berg.">edited August 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>"No, you can't narrate your own character jumping off the boat, because that depends on the beads drawn at the end of the scene"</p></div></blockquote>This is almost exactly what I'm pondering in the <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21767/playing-toward-partially-pre-established-outcomes" rel="nofollow">Playing toward partially pre-established outcomes</a> thread.

In fact, this choice is what defines the setting for the game, thus you make it before even creating characters: everything is defined by and measured against the Quest.<br/>Each round of scenes (of which there are three to a game) begins with one of the players stating what the next step is in the Quest - the next goal to be achieved or threat to be averted. <i>Then</i> you play out several scenes to demonstrate how your characters deal with the problem or goal at hand, how do they feel towards each other and about the Quest as a whole, etc. (crucially, the details of character creation will have established the characters as working together, but also more or less at odds regarding <i>why</i>). Usually, players each frame a scene per round, though this also depends on how many players there are.<br/>Finally, after each round of scenes colored stones are drawn from a bag to establish whether the fellowship (as a whole) succeeded or failed at their goal for this stage of the Quest, as well as how much their success cost them (i.e. whether they lose a member) or whether the reason for their failure is one of them betrayed the others (or was betrayed by them). The players as a group decide on the exact implementation of this "oracle" (such as, which of the characters is lost) based on the events of play so far. Crucially, how many stones per color are put in the bag also depends on the events of play, as evaluated by the players both in terms of objective refereeing ("Have your characters done what it takes to succeed?") and of subjective character feelings ("Are you dissatisfied with what the fellowship has done? Do you actually want the Quest to be successful, as of now?").<br/>The final resolution of the Quest is also affected by whether the previous two challenges where won or lost. Thus, all of the events of play ultimately feed into the final overarching goal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moconnor" title="moconnor"><img alt="moconnor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/483/n3W81Z19PQYI6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moconnor">moconnor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476156/#Comment_476156" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-15T21:49:17+00:00" title="August 15, 2018  9:49PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Rafu" rel="nofollow">Rafu</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p> Crucially, how many stones per color are put in the bag also depends on the events of play, as evaluated by the players both in terms of objective refereeing ("Have your characters done what it takes to succeed?") and of subjective character feelings ("Are you dissatisfied with what the fellowship has done?

I tried split the difference by describing attempts and asking how the other character responded, but it felt a little stilted.<br/><br/>In my initial reflection, asking "What would it take to kill this character?" (up to and including my character dying) seemed like an elegant solution.  I have since learned that it's cleaner to have the betraying character exit the game so that player can focus on their other character and that opposition to the Fellowship (short of completing a challenge) and be dealt with decisively in the moment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
