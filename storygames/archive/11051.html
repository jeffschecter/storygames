It's not really In a Wicked World of Darkness; there are some fundamental setting assumptions that differ greatly from the big Vampire games.  Really, I conceive the setting as being more of a mix of Supernatural and Sin City.<br/><br/>Wicked Nights uses the rules of In a Wicked Age/The Anthology engine.  You'll need those to play.  The game features three oracles: Sex, Lies, and Blood, which focuses on intrigue, backstabs, dirty dealings, and (rarely) love.  Hunters Hunted is about action and killing- vampires killing each other, vampires hunting mortals, and mortals hunting vampires.  When Nightmares Walk the Earth features things even vampires fear.  This is the oracle of stranger things, broader weirdness and creature features.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Drawing from the Oracles<br/>The Spades and suit of each deck explicitly features a Vampire or Vampires.  (So do the Aces.)  If no Aces or Spades are drawn in the first three cards, the last card is automatically considered a Spade.<br/>(If the 3 of Diamonds, the Four of Clubs, the King of Hearts., and then the 2 of Clubs are drawn, the last card- the 2 of Clubs- is considered a Spade instead.)<br/>When playing off the Owe List, the player picking the oracle may announce that the third card counts as a Spade before it is drawn (if no Spade is drawn in the first two cards), and then pick any Oracle entry, or they may pick a Spade for the fourth entry.  Of course, if a Spade is drawn in the first few picks, the player may choose an oracle entry freely.<br/><br/>Stats and the Supernatural<br/>Supernatural beings tend to have an advantage over their mortal counterparts.  To account for this, mortal characters have the normal stat spread (d4, d6, d6, d8, d10, d12.)<br/>Non-Vampire supernatural creatures, such as ghouls (mortal humans who regularly drink vampire blood) other occultists, werewolfs, swampthings, and whatever the oracle generates, have a stat spread of d4, d6, d8, d8, d10, d12.  Ghouls must put either their d4 or their d6 in With Love.<br/>Vampires have a stat spread of d6, d8, d8, d10, d12, and they put no die in With Love.  They may not act With Love, ever.  Vampires have to have two other stats reduced to zero to be out of the fiction.<br/><br/>If a character becomes a supernatural thing in the progress of play, they do not get to reset their dice.  Next session they may reset their dice as appropriate, AND gain a particular strength suited to their new status, if appropriate.<br/><br/>Particular Strengths and Such<br/>You can't take an occult or supernatural particular strength unless it's reasonably indicated by the oracles.  You can't be a supernatural creature unless it's reasonably indicated by the oracles.  Mortal characters should generally have narrow, mundane particular strengths that are useful when they come up and allow them to be competitive in a certain specialization.  Non-vampire supernatural things should generally take whatever they are as a particular strength (Werewolf, Necromancer, etc.)  Vampires often have a particular strength tied to what particular vampiric powers they have unlocked, and should be given a bit of latitude in determining what those are.<br/><br/>Setting Themes<br/><br/>Social Isolation<br/>Only the characters implied by the oracles are important to the story.  These are personal stories, about people with personal wants, needs, and grudges.  The outside world does not care about your shit.  The only people you can turn to are the other characters in the session.  The contact you went to great lengths to gain in the last session?  He sympathizes, but is caught up in his own mess.  If you want to solve your problems, you got to do it yourself.  Cellphones and TV and the internet are great, but they just expose you to a world of uncaring billions.  Packing up and moving to the next town over is fine and good, but it just takes you out of it as you leave all your best interests behind.  This is a world of black and white, where anything worth happening occurs at night, the neighbors shut their windows and turn the music up to drown out the screams, and it's probably raining.<br/><br/>The Secret<br/>Vampires are real.  And also occultists, and werewolves, and who knows what else.  You'd think with all those things going bump in the night, someone would notice?<br/>Most people don't know.  Most people don't want to know.  The people who do know?  They keep real quiet.  Who's going to believe you?<br/>There is no global conspiracy to keep the Secret secret.  Yet the Secret is surprisingly durable.  People have a way of rationalizing things, selectively forgetting things, trivializing things.  They want things to make sense.  Other people want things to stay Secret.  There may be no global conspiracy, but there are individual ones.<br/>Many, many individuals know a fragment of the truth- the supernatural is real.  But society as a whole?  It won't face up to it, and probably can't face up to it.<br/>And no one is trying to reveal the Secret- not the whole Secret anyway.  They're too damn caught up in their own messes.<br/><br/><br/>Vampire Society (Or Lack Thereof)<br/>Vampires are antisocial creatures.  They do not organize themselves into clubs, organizations, or governments.  (Some try, but these experiments are typically small and short lived.)  Usually, they hate and avoid each other.  A vampire likely knows other vampires, and grudgingly tolerates them and even cooperates for a time against mutual enemies.  There are no kings of the vampires, no pacts, no worldwide alliances or networks.  Vampires are parasties upon man, but in regards to their own kind, each must be prepared to exist in a vacuum.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

The first was me, Tim, and Brendan, and used the WNWtE Oracle.  We drew 4C (Ex-cop, working for a shell company), the 8H (perpetual motion machine drawing energy), the Ace of Hearts (vampire child chained in a basement), and an entry I deleted, which was a freak snowstorm in July.<br/><br/>Story involved two corrupt university researchers, one (Brendan's character) experimenting on her own vampire son, and the other who designed an entropy machine that was tearing everything apart, and the characters stuck in the middle, like Tim's security guy, the father of the vampire, the scientists research assistant, and of course, Billy, the 6 year old savage blood starved vampire.<br/><br/>And that damn July snowstorm?  Never really came up.  Ostensibly created by the workings of the entropy machine, I nixed it from the oracles because it was not at all inspiring.  Really, a good example of how to write a bad oracle entry.  I'm not completely satisfied with what I replaced it with either (Jack of Hearts, Hell's Intersection.)<br/><br/>Session two was also WNWtE, and was a larger crowd- me running for Tim, Len, Amelia, Sabe, and Misha.  Entries were the Marijuana Farm w/ Glowing Stone, Voodoo Magician, Dark Magic Fraternity, and Young Vamp forced to Eat Own Hand.  Plot was basically the fratguys (Amelia, plus Sabe playing the girlfriend), trying to get high, not get shot by the crazy redneck lady who tilled the farm (Len), with interference from vampire Misha and voodoo guy Tim.  Had very much a slasher movie vibe.  Focus was really on the fratguys and the girlfriend.  Mortals have an amazingly easy time of getting on the owe list, which may be appropriate in this kind of story, since it's really about the victims.  Misha's vampire got rather low screen time, but ended up forging a cool unholy alliance with the Voodoo guy.<br/><br/>The oracle entries here were a lot punchier- the Fraternity was ripe with lots of characters, the marijuana field seemed to tie right in, and the glowing stone was the focus of power for the Voodoo guy, who was a great villain.  The least punchy one seemed to be the vampire one, as we struggled to tie it in.  But the session was good!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_245282">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245282/#Comment_245282" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-05T13:25:17+00:00" title="December  5, 2009  1:25PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, if anyone else plays this, let me know how it goes.

They really get me excited to run a game with my girlfriend and our vampire-loving friend. I'm also wondering about the optional rules and if they're needed.<br/><br/>Some thoughts:<br/>I'D LOVE IT if some graphically inclined person would whip up a character sheet for this, but the regular IAWA sheets seem to fit the aesthetic ok but not perfectly.<br/><br/>With the vampires dice spread at 5 forms, how the hell do I figure out the npc's forms? Or does this mean that the GM has to whip up all 5/6 forms for npcs? NOOOO! Don't take away ease of use!<br/><br/>There's a shit-ton of vampires in this setting. I'm assuming that's the intent, but even without the slightly confusing oracle draw restrictions rules you made, it seems that vampires will be bumping into each other all of the time and that seems to take away some of the horror and mystery about them.<br/><br/>The spade draw rule thing seems to already be solved by simply having so many damned vampire entries. And think, if there is a session in a VAMPIRE game where no vampires are in the session, that would be very fun to see how the non-vamps do things for a bit. Remember that the owe list and and oracles will keep those bloodsuckers coming.<br/><br/>I don't think you need to differentiate the particular strength rules when it comes to mortals/nonmortals/vamps as the fiction and players will tend to do that. What would be cool is add a new type of particular strength rule that would be appropriate.<br/><br/>I DO like the idea of different dice spreads for vamps/mortals/and everything else. That just seems fun.<br/><br/>The NO WITH LOVE rule is awesome!<br/><br/>I am a huge fan of only using two of the Injured, exhausted, and shamed/humiliated um, things. I think it reinforces the genre nicely without hammering it over the player's heads. I would personally use shamed/humiliated (calling it frightened) and exhausted. I'd be taking out injured, as hardly anyone should survive an actual attack in this world. This would also mean that weakened (mechanically) characters would rely on "for others" and "covertly" which gives those vampire characters a nice way to reform themselves.<br/><br/>My main point is that your oracles rock. And those are the hardest part of customizing IAWA.

I'm not an expert on WoD, but do Vampires really not love? I'd sooner remove their "For Others", I see them more as solitary, egocentric, non-altruistic creatures. But creatures that can still love. Or maybe I've just watched Coppola's Dracula too recently. You know, the undying love for his wife transfered to Mina and all that.<br/><br/>And aren't ghouls in WoD often a sort of slave, bound to their vampire masters by blind adoration, something we might in fact call love? I'd give the ghouls the high die in With Love instead of high.<br/><br/><br/>But yeah, it all depends on your interpretation of vampire lore, it's a great hack.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
