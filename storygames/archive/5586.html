The scenario involves Zeus taking fire away from humanity because Prometheus has reneged on his penance for giving people fire.  A key objective in the quest is to climb the \u2018Spine of the World\u2019 in order to return the ring of stone to Prometheus, who is imprisoned once more for breaking his penance.<br/>Based on some constructive criticism from Dreamation, at ISN play started with a fight against Cerberus to retrieve the ring, and then the climb of the Mountain.  Although I enjoyed it, the climb took a long time and was somewhat \u2018fitful\u2019.  I want to revise it.  <br/>I\u2019m providing some information on how we did it at ISN, keying in on the issues that I thing need adjusting.  Following that are the changes I\u2019m contemplating.<br/><br/>As ran:  <br/>1. The Mountain is 17 zones long, ranging from 0 to 16.<br/>2. Some zones are \u2018empty\u2019.  Heroes can take an interlude if they are together in an empty zone.    <br/>3. Most zones have some sort of obstacle:  sheer cliff, giants, mountain dwarves, etc.  For  zones with an obstacle, written on the map are the opposition dice (2d6, 2d8 harmful, etc.); the Glory value for the highest hero roll; and the result of failure (-2 to next positioning roll, fall 1-12 zones, etc.)<br/>4. Zone 0 is \u2018the Black Labyrinth\u2019.  Heroes remaining in the Black Labyrinth at the end of positioning have failed the climb (as if they were defeated in a battle).  <br/>5. Heroes begin in zone 1.  <br/>6. Climbing the Mountain is done via positioning rolls; the Mountain rolls 1d12 for its name.  <br/>7. After positioning, any hero on a zone with an obstacle must have a simple contest against that obstacle.  Multiple heroes on the same zone participate in the same simple contest.  The skill used depends on what the characters do.  Any hero not on the zone can choose to compete, but at a -2 penalty for each zone away from the site of the contest.   <br/>8. Obstacles are never completely eliminated.  This means they must be faced several times if the heroes split up or get moved backwards, but it also means the glory for the obstacle can be awarded multiple times.  <br/>9. Heroes reaching the pinnacle first (which was empty) share the pinnacle\u2019s Glory award (16 Glory).<br/>10. Heroes at the pinnacle automatically \u2018win\u2019 positioning.<br/><br/>Proposed revisions:   <br/>1. In an early version of the climb, the Mountain also had attack and defense abilities.  After positioning and the simple contests with the obstacles in zones, the heroes and the Mountain would engage in a non-combat battle.  The Mountain would attack to wound the heroes (avalanches, snow storms, winds, etc.).  The heroes\u2019 attacks could not wound the mountain but, if successful, would earn positioning bonuses.  I\u2019ve dispensed with this as it took too long, but does it appeal to anyone?<br/>2. Shorten the climb from 17 to 8 or 9 zones.  The 17 length developed from taping two of the 8 range battle grids together length-wise, and then later adding \u20180\u2019.  So it is an arbitrary length that now seems too long. <br/>3. In the shortened climb, remove empty zones.  But allow interludes whenever called for by the heroes whether together or not on the climb.  Or maybe only if together?  <br/>4. Predetermine the skill required at each obstacle.  Cunning versus the dwarves; Might versus the ice elemental; etc.  This appeals to me from a time management point of view, as the heroes spent a lot of time deciding how to approach each obstacle and thereby determine the skill to use.  But it seems too restrictive.<br/>5. Eliminate obstacles once defeated for the first time.  This provides an incentive to lead the climb.  OR<br/>6. Award Glory only the first time an obstacle in defeated.  Subsequent contests with the same obstacle earn no glory.  This really provides incentive to lead the climb as well as maintaining the risk for having to repeat any obstacles due to falls or bad positioning rolls.    <br/>7. Only allow heroes in an obstacle\u2019s zone to compete.  This penalizes slow climbers.  OR<br/>8. Only allow heroes in an obstacle\u2019s zone to be eligible for Glory from that obstacle (although all may compete).  This penalizes slow climbers, but provides the opportunity for slower climbers to provide assistance in exchange for Oaths.  <br/>9. The Black Labyrinth\u2014failure of the climb is too harsh.  It takes the player out of the scene.  Perhaps the penalty is simply a lost turn?<br/><br/>I know this may be somewhat cryptic to anyone not familiar with Agon or specifically with the \u2018Spine of the World\u2019 but nonetheless I\u2019m interested in getting your reactions to these ideas.   <br/>Mel                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125224/#Comment_125224" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-08T13:04:48+00:00" title="February  8, 2008  1:04PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 8, 2008 3:11PM by John_Harper.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whew! At first glance, this looks way too complicated to me. This goes from providing adversity for the heroes to pretty much taking over the whole game, which is outside the bounds of the Antagonist's job. I mean, once they're into this mountain business, they're stuck, it seems. What if they want to go do something else?<br/><br/>The three quests from the gods give the heroes several broad directions to go in, so they have the opportunity to disagree and struggle among themselves about what to do. But the mountain simplifies that to "Climb higher," which removes an important part of game play. Arguably the most important part.<br/><br/>I say, keep it simple. The mountain might be a few different quest objectives, wrapping up with a battle against a Mountain NPC. No special range strips for climbing or anything. And especially no locking the heroes into a chain of events that they are required to do. Maybe they do a few of the mountain quest objectives, then go off to deal with something else. Maybe they get into a battle with the Mountain and decide it's not worth it and flee.<br/><br/>The heroes need to have that freedom to take it or leave it, to move on to whatever they're interested in. In Agon, there's no "dungeon" that the party is locked into completing for the evening.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125252/#Comment_125252" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-08T13:56:26+00:00" title="February  8, 2008  1:56PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John,<br/>Thanks!  Yeah, I think the idea of climbing the mountain began to take on a life of its own without a 'good idea cut-off' point.  There is one element I'd like to retain, and that is the idea of a race to the top using positioning, perhaps as an addition to a non-combat battle against the mountain.  But the game at Ice Station Nerdly fell a little flat for me because of your point exactly:  the heroes were locked into getting to the top in a long string of contests.  That's not what I wanted.  <br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125331">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zipht" title="zipht"><img alt="zipht" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/173668_1770784817_2474986_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zipht">zipht</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125331/#Comment_125331" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-08T19:09:26+00:00" title="February  8, 2008  7:09PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played in Mel's demo at Ice Station Nerdly. I really liked it, a one shoot can't fully show off all the awesome that Agon is.  <br/><br/>I like the idea of the race up the mountain, being a non-combat battle. Make choosing the Ability to test a contest.<br/>Really Mel, our group should try out more non-combat battles, to get the right feel. from my reading, a n-c battle inflicts wounds. So while it is by the book the way to run this, I do not know if it's really what we really want. that is who if anyone can get to the top, and what favors will they call in, also how much glory can be gotten by working with others vis running ahead.<br/><br/>Mel the best way I can think of doing it is to, write up the mountain as a NPC, give it wound levels. As the PC's inflict wounds we move up the mountain, so keep a visual map... how to make it more self vis the group I don't know.. Just how does someone get ahead in a n-c battle? How do I know who wins a race? The character with the lest wounds? Maybe have it so that the mountain's attacks do not have to inflict a wound, they could just push us back, while our attacks could let us climb higher?<br/><br/>I think that somehow you should encourage using an interlude, just after a battle. All to often we just burned our fate. Well, everyone but me, thus why I won.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125335/#Comment_125335" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-08T19:25:32+00:00" title="February  8, 2008  7:25PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: zipht</cite><br/><br/>As the PC's inflict wounds we move up the mountain, so keep a visual map... how to make it more self vis the group I don't know..

There is a 'map' of the mountain with six 'zones' corresponding to the six wound boxes, and whichever hero inflicts each wound is the first to reach that particular height on the mountain.  A drawback is 'explaining' if a hero inflicts a 3 wound (for example) and then a 1 wound...but that's not a major problem.  This model takes away the 'strategery' of physically moving up the map but there is still competition in the battle just as in any other battle.  <br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125437/#Comment_125437" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-09T15:54:27+00:00" title="February  9, 2008  3:54PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a great idea, Nicholas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125804/#Comment_125804" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-11T11:58:40+00:00" title="February 11, 2008 11:58AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mel White</cite>7.

I've ran this climb several times and, although it wasn't my original intent, what happens is that one or more heroes wants to be the first guy to the top, while along the way scooping up all the glory in the various contests.  The way I've ran it up until now is that everybody gets to compete if they choose to, which means there is absolutely no incentive to be in the lead...other than bragging rights--and perhaps that's enough. I was just looking for a way to reward a hero for risking climbing in the front, as well as the potential for greater danger.  As I've mentioned, I'm content to accept that this was an interesting idea that requires too many special rules to be manageable.  <br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
