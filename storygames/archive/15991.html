So I'd like to try to go this year!  The catch for me is that I'd need to bring my 4 year old along (my wife doesn't game at all, and Dreamation is my yearly foist-the-kid-on-the-wife event - plus, Ruth has been asking me if we can go camping some day, and there may be an inexpensive telescope in her future that won't get much use in the light-polluted Baltimore sky, but anyway).<br/><br/>Lots of people I like go to Camp Nerdly, so I'd actually be pretty cool with just hanging out with toddlers, chatting with people, and maybe gaming in the evening (or not).  But, as any other parents know, that's waaay easier if you're not the only person there with a little one.  I noticed in the main Nerdly thread that Jule Ann was planning to organize some kids stuff during the day, so really the discussion can start with:<br/><br/>1. Hey, Jule Ann, that's awesome, can I help?<br/>2. Anyone else planning to come with kids in the same age ballpark?<br/>3. Any other ideas for what to do with kids?  I was thinking I'd maybe laminate some photos of leaves, flowers, and animals common to the area and we could have a nature walk/scavenger hunt.  Or maybe run my "you guys are zombies, you guys are people, go for it" hack of Shelter in Place.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364049/#Comment_364049" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-29T18:21:48+00:00" title="February 29, 2012  6:21PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 1, 2012 4:52AM by Adam_Dray.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kidless me has only this to add: there's too much tree cover for a telescope.

Jule Ann and Jeremy will have Valerie, who'll be 4 in August, and Dorothy, who'll be around 1.5 years. Everyone's walking (unless there are more kids coming I don't know about), which makes some things easier.<br/><br/>Last year at Nerdly we made it a point to organize a few casual kid activities and have a few things on hand for play. We did...<br/><br/>*A "fairy egg" hunt (colorful Easter eggs with little toys and snacks inside) which was fun for both the hunt and the time spent going over the spoils. I'll plan to do this again this year.<br/><br/>*Played with bubbles, balls, and a parachute<br/><br/>*Took little nature walks and played on the nearby playground equipment.<br/><br/>There may have been more, but that's what I remember. It's a pretty easy place to have a little kid. Lots of areas they can safely explore and run around in. When I was on Asher duty last year, I had plenty of opportunities to chat with other adults while keeping an eye on him (this isn't really the case at a hotel con where there's a lot more he can get into and most of the really interesting stuff is off-limits). <br/><br/>If you come for the weekend and play only at night, that's two games, which isn't bad. You might even be able to play during the day, if we can come up with a kid-duty rotation that everyone's ok with. We can figure out some evening watch system so parents can be alerted if their little one wakes and needs them. (The sleeping cabins are separate from the gaming cabins.) Also, lots of little pick-up games happen, so we could probably play some short, casual games while the kids play.  <br/><br/>-Rachel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jule%20Ann" title="Jule Ann"><img alt="Jule Ann" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jule%20Ann">Jule Ann</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364132/#Comment_364132" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T06:52:05+00:00" title="March  1, 2012  6:52AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Honestly, the more parents with kids who come to Nerdly, the better it will be for parents with kids. Last year, my husband and I alternated gaming slots - I'd be on kid-duty for one, then he'd be on kid-duty for the next one. I managed to play in half the slots, plus a pick-up game or two, which is totally worthwhile for me. With two families, we had a total of four parents to rotate through for kid-duty. If we had just one more family, we would have six parents to rotate through, which would mean fewer kid-duty shifts for each parent. I may be getting a niece to come along and help us out with the kids this year, too, so I can get a few more slots in. I'll keep you posted on that.<br/><br/>Last year, we had organized kid events during the daytime slots (as Rachel mentioned above), although the kids were a year younger last year, so the games were very simple. This year, we may delve into slightly more complex games, like "red-light/green-light" or "Mother May I?" We're probably a few years away from proper RPGs with the kids we have, but if people wanted to bring older kids, we could organize a few simplified RPG games for them, too. My oldest daughter is starting to understand the concept of roleplaying, but she doesn't really understand having to follow rules yet. I bet we could experiment with a bit of freeform roleplaying with her and your daughter, though.<br/><br/>It really is a great setting for a con with kids. There's plenty of space to run and play, and you can socialize while the kids run around. And Nerdly is participant-driven - everyone who comes has to run a game. If you come with a kid, you are expected to run a kid-friendly game. So, more parents = more kid-friendly games.<br/><br/>(Along these same lines, the more non-gaming wives there are at Nerdly, the more non-gaming things there will be to do for them. I know a lot of knitters have come to Nerdly in the past, and there are often pick-up board games going on. There's usually at least one hike, and sometimes someone runs a craft workshop or a yoga demonstration or something. It's all up to the participants.)<br/><br/>For nights, we claimed the cabin nearest the bathrooms and the main hall last year. It worked well. We forgot out baby monitor last year, so the parents took turns hanging out and reading at the kid-friendly cabin. With a baby monitor, the "night duty" parent could probably even venture over to the main hall for pick-up games after the kids were all quiet. Each cabin has three rooms - one with 2 beds, and two with 4 beds - plus a "lobby" sort of room by the door. I think we could do a bit of reconfiguring to make it work for three families.<br/><br/>Once registration is open, we'll start to have a better idea of how many kids are coming, and what ages they are. From there, we can divvy up game slots, and do more concrete game/activity planning. A lot of it will probably happen on-site, too. Things tend to be pretty flexible at Nerdly. <br/><br/>I really hope you end up coming! Valerie (my 3.5 year old) would love to have a playmate closer to her age!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Levine" title="Daniel Levine"><img alt="Daniel Levine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Levine">Daniel Levine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364146/#Comment_364146" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T07:18:04+00:00" title="March  1, 2012  7:18AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My plan is to come!  And I'm happy to run kid-friendly stuff.  Like I said, it'd be worth it to me to hang out even if I get *no* games in (not sure how well Ruth will do sleeping in a different place, she's pretty finicky, so even nights may be a bit tough).<br/><br/>I *will* be coming alone, though.  As I mentioned to Rachael at Dreamation, there's sort of no good angle on my wife (Melissa) coming.  She knits, but she's as uninterested in board games as RPGs.  And if she comes, it's "I get to hang out with my friends and do cool stuff" vs. "Melissa maybe meets some folks she likes and has to find stuff to do," which will put inevitable pressure on the equity of child watching, etc. etc.<br/><br/>Anyway, sounds like you guys are way ahead of where I am.  Let me know if there's more I can do to help/plan.  I'm the kind of Dad who tends to let Ruth run around and play what she wants to, so I'm bad at coming up with structured activities.  She does like to cook with me, though, so maybe I can bring some kid-friendly snack-making materials.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364156/#Comment_364156" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T07:56:41+00:00" title="March  1, 2012  7:56AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm really looking forward to Camp Nerdly.

I'm going to be prepared to run Happy Birthday Robot and a story-game about princesses that my daughter likes. I'll also pack along some more-or-less (older) kid-friendly board and card games--Uno, Carcassone, Jungle Speed. But if the weather's nice some outdoor activities would be nice.

My son can be a little... strange, as he has autism, and though he has an 11-year-old's body, he still acts and plays like he's six.  There's also the inconvenient fact that my wife's birthday is the 19th, so I'm not sure if she'd go crazy for camping out on her 42nd.  I guess we'll see.<br/><br/>I will say this: if I <i>did</i> come and my son <i>did</i> accompany me, he's very good with smaller children (he still thinks he is one), so he's not a danger to anyone.  He'll just want to drag you into a game of Light Strike, most likely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jule%20Ann" title="Jule Ann"><img alt="Jule Ann" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jule%20Ann">Jule Ann</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364424/#Comment_364424" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T19:38:16+00:00" title="March  1, 2012  7:38PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bill White, that is awesome!

Paradoxically, the more kids there are, the less they will impinge upon the carefree prerogatives of the childless, since kids like to play with each other.

The more kids there are, the more the kids will keep each other out of our hair. I have a friend with three kids, and we take turns going to each other's houses to clean. One adult with 2 or 3 kids has a hard time getting anything done, because at least one of the kids always seems to need something from the adult. Two adults and 5 kids can get so much more done, because the kids entertain each other, and when one of them needs something, that still leaves one other adult free to keep washing dishes. Replace washing dishes with playing games, and two adults with lots of adults, you have a recipe for a fun weekend.<br/><br/>Having not been there the year where kids were an issue, I can't speak to that, but I do think we're on track for avoiding future issues with the rules we have. If anyone is planning something big and outdoors that they need kids to be kept away from, it's just going to have to be a matter of communicating this ahead of time and making sure everyone is on the same page. Boffer fighting in the field near the Castle might work, but the field is also right next to the playground, so we would need to delineate some kid-free boundaries (ropes on the ground or something), and warn the parents ahead of time that maybe, they might want to play with their kids on the other side of camp during that game slot, and come back to the playground later.<br/><br/>Maybe we could designate one building to be a kid-positive building, to go along with the kid-free building. Then we would have an indoor space for the kids to escape to in case of rain/cold, and a place to keep all the playdough/parachutes/crayons. It also gives the kids a sense of "this is where we belong, and this is the stuff we can touch" rather than just a sense of "that place is where we are not allowed to go."<br/><br/>Keeping kids out of non-kid-appropriate games is as easy as having GMs list an age limit for their games. As long as there is at least one kid-friendly option during each time slot, parents can direct their kids towards those options.<br/><br/>Also, can I just say that even the idea that non-parents would run kid-friendly games and/or help out with childcare warms my heart to no end. This, of course, doesn't change the fact that my kids and their entertainment are ultimately my responsibility, but it's really cool that other people want to reach out to the parents/kids population. That makes the reciprocity of keeping my kids out of the Castle and the boffer wars that much easier.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364576/#Comment_364576" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-02T07:44:19+00:00" title="March  2, 2012  7:44AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 2, 2012 7:45AM by Andy.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sean:<br/><br/>What Jason said. To be clear, the issue we had in the past wasn't with things that happened by accident ("I turned around for a moment, and..."). It was basically an adult telling everyone that their young kids were totally cool with being left on their own even when organizers of potentially dangerous events vocally Weren't Cool With It (they started chasing each others with scissors and knives); or that they could totally handle adult situations (they would wander around the adult play spaces, often chasing each other with aforementioned weapons or sticks; sessions in the middle of immersive roleplay would clam up just like a couple at a restaurant when the waitress approaches); so that the adult could go off and play the games they wanted to without having to be bothered by watching the kids.<br/><br/>It was a problematic situation, no one got hurt or anything, but there was a very real unease that something might at any moment. It's been years since we implemented those rules, those people haven't been back (on their own volition, they sensed that they were not welcome), and as we expected there has been no problems ever since.<br/><br/>What Bill said (EDIT, crosspost: And Jule Ann, in deep detail!!) is totally spot on as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364577/#Comment_364577" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-02T07:44:28+00:00" title="March  2, 2012  7:44AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jule Ann</cite>Maybe we could designate one building to be a kid-positive building</blockquote>\nThat's a good idea, maybe the Tower?

Older kids are very helpful in child-minding; they often have the energy to do the same thing over and over when adults run out of steam. And it makes them feel important. It would be great to have some older kids in the rotation.\n<blockquote>The twins haven't taken well to card or board games yet -- we're just starting to tackle Chutes and Ladders and Candyland -- but you never know when the spark will hit them.</blockquote>\nSlightly off-topic, but have you tried Uno? I bought a couple cheap decks of Uno from the dollar store for my 3.5 year old, and she loves it. I took out all the "punishment" cards (pick-ups and skips and reverses), which makes it just a game about matching colors and numbers. It's a good, simple game that way. I find Chutes and Ladders and Candyland both slightly confusing to that age group, because the paths are so winding. I think she would do better at a board game with a simple, circular/square path. We also play a really basic dice game where you roll a d6 and try to get every number.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>Or teach chess or something.

She doesn't have much patience for it, yet, and she doesn't understand how the knights move, but she loves moving the pieces around.

With these numbers of kids, two adults would probably be on kid duty at any one time, or one adult and one responsible older kid. This means that, if we can get 8 people to take childcare slots, we would each only have to be on kid duty once. Preschoolers have notoriously short attention spans, so they will probably do several shorter activities in each slot, rather than one long game. I also plan on bringing a smattering of pick-up activities, like coloring books/crayons, balls, play dough, books, etc.<br/><br/>I'm excited that you're bringing your daughter this year!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jule%20Ann" title="Jule Ann"><img alt="Jule Ann" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jule%20Ann">Jule Ann</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369630/#Comment_369630" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-28T07:20:57+00:00" title="March 28, 2012  7:20AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've just added a "Parents and Kids" page to the wiki.
