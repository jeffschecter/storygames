It plays in half an hour for 3 to 6 players. The players run a hero through 5 scenes. Each scene begins with a card. A player says what happens, the other add to that or challenge it. I ran it at Origins and it was a gas. Very different games happened due to the people present.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://hamsterpress.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Snapshot-card-montage.jpg"/><br/><br/>On Sunday I ran it at Games on Demand followed by a game of Fiasco. It was interesting seeing how they were similar. In both cases we made up characters and the situation and made the hero's life complicated. Snapshot was faster but the games are very compatible. So if you like Fiasco, you'll like Snapshot.<br/><br/>I hope you give the project a look. I only need $700. <br/><br/>Chris Engle                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
