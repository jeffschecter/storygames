I love this game and it did not disappoint.  It brought back a lot of memories from my very earliest days of roleplaying.  <br/><br/>I hastily put together a mission that showed off all the cool stuff (except the accounting).  Daslon-2, B8766BE-D, is a struggling little post-industrial backwater with bad air and lots of aid from the Imperium, including three massive atmosphere plants that make the urban centers livable.  Up until recently it had a pro-trade democracy and was doing very well.  Then some military yeggs staged a coup and took the whole planet over.  Now President and Field Marshal, His Excellency Porter Bua runs the place with an iron hand and the poor citizens live in fear.  Everything is nationalized and trade dries up.  Obviously this isn't a great situation, but the Imperium doesn't care as long as nobody messes with the starport.  So concerned business interests step in and hire a mercenary striker battalion (which I named the Traveller-rific Executive Force Application, LLC) to drop down and press the big reset button.  <br/><br/>I had three players - Joel, Joe, and Clinton - and had them each make up three characters.  When they were done, they picked one from among the survivors and I used the others as NPCs.  Joe lost a marine in basic training and Clinton lost a pretty awesome scout to bad luck.  In the end they chose to play a tough as nails ex-marine named Phyllis Chu (Joe), useless ponce and ex-navy Lieutenant Remus Candy  (Joel), and a grizzled six-term merchant named Boots McGhee (Clinton). Making dudes in Traveller is pretty fun.  There are strong elements of gambling and chances for optimization all awash in a vast sea of pure luck, but in the end you get guys with convincing backstories who have lived a little.  Part of the game's original genius is that 100% of the setting is communicated through this process.  They messed this up later, but if you play it straight with the first three books, that's how it works.  You find out guys regularly carry swords because hey, somebody gave you a sword when you mustered out.  <br/><br/>I did a ton of fishing in this session.  I tasked Clinton and Joel with explaining why they had a close relationship with a retired army General, and told Joe his lady (modeled after Vasquez in Aliens) was the niece of the mercenary battalion's commander, Eileen Chu.  His character was battalion S-2, and Joe was cool with that.  The general, in classic railroady fashion, hired the "only two guys he could trust" to join the raid and do a little side work - he had an "important patron" who needed a safety deposit box retrieved from a bank in Daslon City.  The massive attack would provide cover for a bank robbery.  The S-2's job was to keep an eye on the two dubious characters who had been attached at the last moment, through politics above everybody's pay grade.  So it was on, sort of a mix of The Bank Job and Operation Urgent Fury.<br/><br/>I had absolutely no preconceptions about what was actually going on on Daslon-2.  I intimated, through an NPC, that the mercenary company was under strength and short on transport and that the troops were rattled.  The nucleus of an idea formed - the defenders would be both better armed and enjoy more popular support than originally thought.  Once the PCs hit the dirt, I asked the players leading or descriptive questions after every failed roll.  There was an ambush, a firefight with a bunch of fedayeen-like irregulars, and an abortive rescue mission to relieve mercenaries pinned down at the Daslon military base.  Eventually Clinton and Joel ditched Joe to go rob the bank.  One nice thing here was that Joe was alert to the arc of the session, and quickly realized the story wasn't about his guy - it was about the criminals, and he willingly faded into the background for a while, injecting color and playing NPCs before Phyllis set off to track them down.<br/><br/>They went into the Daslon-2 financial district, bluffed their way past roadblocks and into the bank, and got the McGuffin.  It was clear at this point that the striker raid was a total failure, and the recall was sounded - now it was a race against time to get to the rally point.  As they were stealing an armored car for the trip, Phyllis Chu tried to track the criminals down and was caught by pro-coup soldiers.  They were about to hang her when Clinton and Joel showed up, and another firefight ensued.  They saved her life, but the cost was high - they'd never make the rendezvous, and were trapped on Daslon-2.  A perfect cliffhanger to wrap up on.  <br/><br/>At one point the armored car was flipped and set on fire, and the McGuffin's safe deposit box was broken open.  I asked them what was inside, adding only that it bore the seal of Grand Princess Ciencia Iphegenia, fifth daughter of the Emperor.  They decided it was the only copy of the Emperor's genome, hidden and lost in some power play and obviously priceless.  I thought that was pretty cool, and way better than anything I had in mind (dirty pictures?  A black globe?).  I had a page of notes, mostly names and locations, and relied on my friends to fill stuff in on the fly, taking my cues from what interested them.  <br/><br/>Honestly, a lot of the fun was brought by us and the game mechanics were a little wonky at times, like the time Joe got in a melee using a foil and we realized that it'd take about a week and a half to disable his opponent in a straight-up fight.  But in other ways the system was surprisingly crisp and elegant.  We all had a great time.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205298">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205298/#Comment_205298" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-05T05:11:13+00:00" title="May  5, 2009  5:11AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 5, 2009 5:11AM by Graham.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love Classic Traveller. It's particularly effective when you throw a few indie techniques in. We played at Concrete Cow and it was really good.<br/><br/>I like what you're saying about having no preconceptions about what's going on on Daslon-2. It gets away from the idea of a staged adventure: from <i>this</i> scene, you find out <i>this</i>, which leads you to <i>here</i>.<br/><br/>Another effective way, I think, is to have an exact idea of what's happening on the planet, but no idea of what the players should do about it. So it's a bit like a Dogs Town: fairly defined, but a big sandbox for the PCs to mess about in. So trade's dried up and the citizens live in fear and...what are you going to do about that? <br/><br/>(On that last note, I wrote a sentence last night that I'm particularly proud of, and it seems connected: "There are three factions on the world. Each is being horrifically cruel to another faction, for a genuinely good reason.". It's that whole idea of establishing a situation, but leaving it to the PCs how to resolve it.)<br/><br/>Sorry, I've tangented. Classic Traveller. Fantastic.

As far as I can tell, it's pretty much the same game as AD&amp;D or Runequest but with lasers instead of swords, planets instead of dungeons. There's hardly anything that I can remember that shows you how to play the game. <br/><br/>So there are implicit rules constraints in terms of what kinds of situations the rules cover (more so than AD&amp;D) and there are implicit genre constraints which are hinted at by the character generation and the examples of play and scenarios but nothing much in the way of explicit constraints to running or playing the game. Not that you can't define your own, as you've done here, but the game seems to do precious little in helping you get there.<br/><br/>Which isn't to say I don't love Classic Traveller too. Although it's perhaps about the aethestic and the memories rather than the way it was written.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_205303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205303/#Comment_205303" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-05T05:30:39+00:00" title="May  5, 2009  5:30AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 5, 2009 5:33AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's totally true.  Later they added "book 0", which includes a dreadful example of play and some "how to roleplay" stuff, but the original three books offered basically nothing.  This certainly didn't stop us back in the day.  It didn't even slow us down, really.<br/><br/>Traveller is also a victim of its time, with a weird obsession with encumbrance and insanely fiddly bits that simply don't matter in play.  But again, this never stopped us from accounting for every square meter of hull space or taking out a second mortgage to finance a new fire control program.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205340/#Comment_205340" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-05T09:08:35+00:00" title="May  5, 2009  9:08AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I had a page of notes, mostly names and locations, and relied on my friends to fill stuff in on the fly, taking my cues from what interested them.</blockquote>\nJason, I think we could all benefit from a write-up of how your group structures your brainstorming and content creation/reincorporation on the fly.<br/><br/>I know I've mentioned this to you in the past, but I tend to run games as they are written and I've had things (especially old-school games) fall a little flat after seeing you (and others) have a great time with the game.<br/><br/>So I'm guessing there are some techniques that maybe you and your group just do naturally and don't necessarily think about. I'm thinking specifically of the Contenders game you played a few years back where you were reincorporating content like madmen.<br/><br/>Would you feel like digging deep and writing some notes?

Something I notice when I run classic D&amp;D and when we played Traveller last night is that we take seriously the author's instructions to make the game your own. (I don't know if Traveller says this, actually, but I'm assuming, based on the design sensibilities of its time.) So, yeah, we emphasize certain parts more than others. We didn't use encumbrance last night, but I never have in any game ever, so that's not really not playing by the rules as much as taking the game's advice.<br/><br/>With that said, I think we hue to the rules more than you'd imagine. There was lots of comparison last night of weapons versus armor to get the difficulty modifier. I was surprised and sad when I found my laser carbine was -7 against reflec. What are you supposed to do? (Maybe carry a second gun.) In D&amp;D, I use all the rules in Basic, plus some homebrew rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205362/#Comment_205362" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-05T10:16:26+00:00" title="May  5, 2009 10:16AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, there's some truth in that, but you've expressed it in a very Indie Gamer way.

You can hear us playing  and talking about playing <a href="http://virtualplay.podbus.com/?p=62" rel="nofollow">here</a>, <a href="http://virtualplay.podbus.com/?p=60" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and to a lesser extent <a href="http://virtualplay.podbus.com/?p=66" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>Our method is explicitly meta-gamey, in that there's a point during play where the referee is creating a "task sequence" of actions needed to accomplish the goal the characters have set for themselves. It amounts to a system for dressing up good and bad rolls, perhaps, but it really helps generate the caper-film feel of old-school Traveller play in a fast and furious kind of way: Once the dice hit the table, you're in it for better or worse.<br/><br/>Here's part of what I have so far.\n<blockquote>You describe what you want to achieve, and you and the referee discuss the constituent tasks required to achieve it. The result is a task sequence of two to five tasks whose outcome determines the overall success or failure of the effort. <br/><br/>For each task, the referee sets the requisite difficulty (Routine 5+, Hard 8+, Very Hard 11+) as well as the general consequences of success or failure. One character leads the effort in every case; this is the \u201cactive character.\u201d There may be a different active character for each task of the task sequence. That character\u2019s player describes how the character conducts the task, \u201cnarrating in\u201d up to one trait, one skill, and one item of technology in order to do so.  A trait gives a bonus or penalty according to its value in the usual way (2, -3; 3 or 4, -2; 5 or 6,  -1; 7, +0; 8 or 9, +1; 10 or 11, +2; 12, +3). A skill provides its value as a bonus to the roll. <br/><br/>Other characters may be able to help, depending on the task. The player of a character who is helping another may narrate in one skill; the bonus is then applied to the roll.<br/><br/>The referee begins the task sequence with 1d6 points worth of complications; this number is allowed to remain secret, and can increase as well as decrease during play. Note that a player can use up the referee\u2019s complications by introducing them himself or herself, but complications must be applied <i>before</i> the roll.<br/><br/>(1-3 pts) Personal Difficulty. Describe how the active character\u2019s personal limitations work against him or her in the current task and apply a DM to the roll based on the value of the trait thus invoked. <br/>(2 pts) Mistaken Assumptions. Describe unforeseen obstacles emerging from misinformation or bad assumptions; make the player re-roll all dice and take the lower result.<br/>(2 pts) Technical Glitch. If the player uses a point of technology to roll additional dice, describe the equipment malfunctioning in some way and choose which two dice the player keeps.<br/>(3 pts) Catastrophic Error. Describe things going badly in a dramatic way. Roll one die and apply the result as a negative DM to the current task.<br/><br/>Generally, a successful roll means progress toward the goal of the task sequence. The immediate consequences of a successful roll may be:<br/><br/>Enabling the task sequence to continue (i.e., moving toward the goal).<br/>Enabling an \u201copportunistic\u201d roll for some other benefit or gain.<br/>Providing a bonus to a subsequent roll, a bonus to all subsequent rolls, or a pool of expendable bonus points for any subsequent roll\u2026<br/>\u2026equal to +1 per 2 points by which the roll was made.<br/>\u2026equal +1 for a routine task, +2 for a hard task, +3 for a very hard task.<br/>Lowering the difficulty of a subsequent task.<br/>Providing points of technology or data.<br/>Providing a reward, payoff, or profit in units of sols, either a fixed amount or in increments based on success.<br/>Specifying the truth of a certain helpful fact, the existence of certain helpful conditions, or the possession of a certain helpful item.<br/>Reducing the referee\u2019s complications pool by a set amount, or by -1 per 2 points by which the roll was made.<br/>Reducing some arbitrary measure of opposition, resistance, or adversity by a set amount, or by -1 per 2 points by which the roll was made.<br/><br/>The consequences of failure are the converse of success, with some additional possibilities as well.<br/><br/>Causing the premature end of the task sequence, or closing off a particular roll.<br/>Providing penalties to subsequent rolls, or adding to the referee\u2019s complications pool.<br/>Causing damage to equipment (which may result in the loss of technology points, penalties to skills, or \u201chits\u201d to equipment).<br/>Causing the loss or corruption of data (which may result in the loss of data points, penalties to skills, and so forth).<br/>Causing injury to characters (which usually takes the form of \u201chits\u201d to individuals).<br/>Causing a loss of cash on hand or other financial loss.<br/>Adding a new and not particularly rewarding task to the sequence (e.g., \u201csurvive an ambush\u201d).<br/>Specifying the truth of a certain unhelpful fact, the existence of certain harmful conditions, or the absence of a certain helpful item.<br/><br/>Give player\u2019s characters and vehicles three hits each; give other characters and equipment one hit each. A character or item that loses all its hits is mortally wounded or critically damaged; medical treatment or technical repair may be employed to save wounded characters and damaged equipment.<br/><br/>In some cases, you may wish to allow players to achieve success by taking damage, loss, or injury on a one-for-one basis (e.g., the active player fails a very hard task, rolling an 8. The effect of failure has been defined as ending the task sequence\u2014\u201creturn to base,\u201d specifically. As the referee, you tell the players that if they take three points of injury or equipment damage, the action may continue).</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205564/#Comment_205564" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-06T04:56:57+00:00" title="May  6, 2009  4:56AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh hey, last night I went back and re-read Book 0.  It is actually quite good, extended example aside, and tells you in great detail how to play the game, as player or referee.  It deals with everything from die rolling conventions to how to find people to play with.  The advice for "rule zero" modification is frank and perceptive - it tells you what Traveller's three core features are, why they are sacrosanct, and what to look out for when you kit-bash other stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
