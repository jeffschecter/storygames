                    HI All!<br/>
(STAY out of the zealot debate, stay OUT of the zealot debate, stay out of the ZEALOT debate)<br/>
<br/>
I have decided that for my next game devlopment process that ALL task resolution will fall into the realm of using an increasing die pool to represent level of mastery in a particular ability/skill.<br/>
<br/>
anyone have any pros and cons about this type of trite system?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks                </div>

                            What kind of game are you going for?<br/><br/>Are you observing only good results on these die pool rolls, or good and bad results?<br/><br/>Don't Rest Your Head makes a lot of use out of its die pools - you get successes from 1's, 2's, 3's... You are also counting highest dice to see which pool is "dominant" and thus influences narration and affects character "advancement".<br/><br/>The ability to do this kind of thing is what makes pools so useful - you can measure several variables at once, instead of just high result / low result.<br/><br/>Verge also did some really interesting stuff with its die pools, in the inception I read (which may or may not be the current one)                        </div>

                            I am going for a game that is very simple to learn, and FUN to play.  I guess I should have posed the question as referring to an increasing NUMBER of dice, instead of an increasing pool.<br/>
<br/>
Each and every task has a target number for success and it is rolled against.  Depending upon the 'level' of mastery one has, they roll more dice.  Each and every piece of tsk resolution is handled in more or less the exact same way.<br/>
<br/>
this makes things easy on the players and allows them to go on with the fun of gaming, rather than require  a PHD in in mathematics and statistics, and consult various expensive tomes, and then weigh them against an endless supply of self-contradiction rules...at least hopefully.<br/>
<br/>
I was particularly wondering about the encumberence of rolling several dice (of the same type ALWAYS) and then doing calculations, and how others that have played similar systems feel about that.<br/>
<br/>
Success would be meeting or overcoming the target difficulty number, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
thanks again                        </div>

The world of Drakness has cool things, and Burning wheel is really cool as well.  In fact, all systems, if you look hard enough, have at least a score of points that merit mention.<br/>

But then again, I know what I feel, but desire the opinions of others, untainted by my own views.  I am building a game for not just myself, but for others, and therefore I thirst for what others opine.<br/>

                            As i've well established by this point i don't know anything, but if all you want is a <i>feeling</i>, then i can put on out:<br/><br/>I've fallen in love with dice-pool systems, both with and without multiple die-types, thanks to games such as Storyteller (taking the mechanics a part from the rest of it), Burning Wheel, Dogs, and non-rpgs such as Ground Zero Game's Stargrunt.<br/><br/>I find a reasonable sized-pool to be very clear, easy to read - even with multiple variables - and also easy to build, construct from the control sheet, whether you are using an increasing die size corelated to numeric value or an increasing number of dice, or both. Very intuitive. <br/>And then you can easily manipulate the results by changing the number of dice needed to get a success by effect both before and after the roll. It feels right. <br/><br/>In Streetfight - a miniature wargame of gang gun battles - you roll d6s to hit with a weapon, with the starting number of dice dependant on the current range and weapon used (curves centered on differing points by weapon), reduce or add dice due to character skill &amp; situation, lose dice to wounds, and so on. 6's are always hits, which are then rerolled for wound effect.  Elegant and clear, yet fits the feel of the weapons. <br/><br/>And, lets face it, rolling a pile of dice is just fun!  &gt;_&gt;  (at least until you get to Exalted's levels...)                        </div>

<p>I want to be clear what you are doing. Are you:</p>
<ul>
<li>comparing each die result to a target number based on the task (old WoD)?</li>
<li>comparing each die result to a fixed target number, then  comparing the number of successes to the task's target (new WoD)?</li>
<li>comparing the sum of the dice to a target number based on the task (sort of an inverse TFT)?</li>
</ul>
<p>Old WoD, new WoD, ORE, and other dice pool systems where the die results are interpretted individually produce a lot of detail, like degree of success, but are harder to predict. The Fantasy Trip, GURPS, and other dice sum systems produce fewer results, often only success/failure, but are much more predictable, so they are good for tactical challenge games.</p>

                            I've got a series of articles on dice mechanics on my <a href="http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/systemdesign/" rel="nofollow"><b>System Design Page</b></a>.  <br/><br/>So I'm going to take up the opposing side for a bit.  Dice pools have a few inherent problems.  For one, they don't scale well.  On the low side, you can't roll less than one die -- and there are often statistical anomalies in a few dice (like Storyteller's infamous rising botch chance).  On the high side, the number of dice rolled becomes more and more unwieldy.  <br/><br/>They also have a minimum complexity.  Single die rolls -- like the Unisystem, say -- can be much faster and simpler.  For example, I'll note that few boardgames use dice pools (or dice other than d6s).  It's an invention of generally more complex RPGs.  <br/><br/>Still, they do give a satisfying tactile feel, allow representation of more intricate probabilities, and can be at least straightforward if not as fast as single-die.                        </div>

                            Hi, Victor.<br/><br/>Joe mentioned that Verge does something a little different with dice pools. It's similar to the system in <a href="http://arcdream.com/godlike/home/index.htm" rel="nofollow">Godlike</a>, or so I gather. In Verge, you essentially roll a pool of d6es and grab the most commonly occurring result. So if you rolled 6654333211111 you'd have four 1's, which would give you 4 successes. You get to add more dice every exchange and there are mechanisms for picking up everything but the 1's (or whichever result you chose) and rerolling it and moving the 1's over to increase your successes.<br/><br/>I like pools because there are more fiddly mechanics you can use: add dice, subtract dice, reroll dice, sort dice, "use" dice, and so on. <br/><br/>No one's mentioned <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> yet, either. You roll a pool of different kinds of dice (like 6d6 + 3d8 + 1d10 + 2d6 and so on) and keep using traits to add more dice. But then you only use two dice at a time as a 'raise' or 'see.' It's extremely effective.<br/><br/>Did you want pros and cons about task resolution systems (vs. conflict resolution systems) as well?                        </div>

                            How is your system different from Burning Wheel, Vampire, or Shadowrun?  If you're saying, "it's a pool just like those", then there are clearly a lot of fans.  Are you doing something tricky/complex beyond one of those systems?                        </div>

                            Thanks everyone...I will try to not only be more clear, but to double check my grammer as my typing (after I looked it over this evening) looks like I had mittens on when I posed the question.<br/>
<br/>
Well the die rolling for the task resolution is going to be solely D6.  Each task can be reseolved by either failure, success, or progress.  The system calls for the player to roll a single die (and add any bonuses where applicable) and then add another die for each degree of mastery in that skill (be it at sign painting, calculus, or swinging a sword, etc).  The result rolled is then compared to a target difficulty number: meeting or beating the target number nets a success or progress.<br/>
<br/>
So yes, you roll more dice against a target number for each degree of skill you have.<br/>
<br/>
It is designed to be very simple and attempts to allow for a very large number of varying difficulties.  <br/>
<br/>
I do see potential problems with scale and the potential problems of adding up 3-6 dice, but then I find it no less cumbersome than other games that i've played that have an endless streams of situational modifiers to be memorized.<br/>
<br/>
And I'd like to thank everyone for there comments thus far.  I now have lots of things to read and ponder to weigh my ideas against.<br/>
<br/>
And to answer directly to:<br/>
<br/>
Xenopulse:  First off, I want to say that my previous answer to you sounds a bit rude to myself right now.  that was not my intention.  Actually I spent a good portion of the night going over Burning wheel stuff again to compare it's 'cool factor' to what I am trying to do.  I just wanted to metniotn that my Hello was meant as an actual greeting, and that I wanted to stress that I was looking for preferences and general opinions, not particularly specifics.  So you mayflog me for my impetuity.<br/>
<br/>
Sempiternity:  I love your prose.  I try to keep in mind the the only true knowledge comes in knowing that we know nothing.  And the idea of eventually rolling more than a handful of dice is paramount on mymind about this system.  <br/>
<br/>
Talysman:  thanks for clarifying things for me.  It was a big help.  It is the sum of the dice weighed against a target number to resolve all things.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
jhkim:  Actually, can I pat your back a little and let you know that I already had your dissertation bookmarked for reference?  I did.  I'd like to know a bit more about the problems with scaling that you mentioned.  I, myself, am not a huge fan of the single-die resolution mechanic as it doesn't cultivate (in my opinion) a higher degree of skill to a large degree and tends to force the average performance of the very skilled to more or less the same as the unskilled.  I heartily welcome your counterpoints on this and look forward to being edified.  (and yes I truly do...how else can I learn to make better games)<br/>
<br/>
Balbinus:  In my attempt to make a singular mechanic for task resolution the roll will be the same whether the target number is arbitrary or rolled by an opponent (in a few instances that I can think of).  Mainly I am talking about achieving success at a task such as walking a tightrope, building a wall, forging a sword, etc...all of which have predetermined difficulties.  And if I have X degrees of skill in that particular task, I get to roll X extra dice.  <br/>
<br/>
Adam Dray:  Thanks, I forgot about Dogs In the Vineyard.  Although the idea of twiddly mechanics has a much larger 'cool factor'  (cool factor is something I think about) than what I'm doing, my primary audience (the group I am writing this game for..with the hopes of it being a break-out megahit.......don't we all!!!) wants something a bit more linear and that has more focus on playing the role rather than cool ways to manipulate the possibilities.  And forgive me for being an idiotic twit, but is it not possible to combine both task AND conflict management into a single mechanic.  I guess I should say that I don't know enough about the formal differences etween the two and I humbly request that you school me in that even if you have to beat the ideas into my melon head.  And yes, please give me All pros and cons on everything.  <br/>
<br/>
ScottM:  I am not doing anything complex beyond the great games that you've mentioned (although i am still trying to find anybody out here that will play shadowrun), in fact, I feel that what I am doing is a bit more linear.  But how is my system different?  Good food for thought there...  And beyond the how's, the why's should be a good point for me to look at as well.<br/>
<br/>
thank you again everyone.  Just getting my thoughts out has been a great help, and listening to everyone's suggestions, references, and requests for clarification has been very helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Please keep this coming as I am only trying to do the best I ever could at making a fun game and cannot really relate how much I appreciate any suggestions, advice, or even criticism.                        </div>

                            Gladen - Sounds like you're not really using a dice pool at all! More of a GURPS-like target number system with an open ended number of dice...<br/><br/>My only impression is that it would be a bit fiddly to work out the the numbers you want to use for base target numbers, with this - since you're summing, each addition of a die blows past the previous scale of values you had to set targets with. <br/>If my greenhorn thief has a one-dot melee skill, for instance, then they can only stab a 3 TN enemy half the time, while the 3-dot fighter can't fail! That's a bit simplistic i know, but still - tricky!<br/><br/>Or are the "mastery levels" perhaps correlated to a "challenge level", so the game expands stepwise from die-range to die-range?<br/><br/>I do see that allowing open-end dice to be added to a fixed target number range system (like GURPS) does give those characters allowed extra dice a very clear "mastery" of their field - sort of similiar to grey or white shade traits in Burning Wheel - so long as you don't have too many or two few dice away from your chosen range...                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: gladen</cite>jhkim:  Actually, can I pat your back a little and let you know that I already had your dissertation bookmarked for reference?  I did.  I'd like to know a bit more about the problems with scaling that you mentioned.  I, myself, am not a huge fan of the single-die resolution mechanic as it doesn't cultivate (in my opinion) a higher degree of skill to a large degree and tends to force the average performance of the very skilled to more or less the same as the unskilled.  I heartily welcome your counterpoints on this and look forward to being edified.  (and yes I truly do...how else can I learn to make better games)</blockquote>
I think the degree of skill is just a question of the range of skill compared to the size of the die -- it's not inherent in the roll, but in how you set your range of skill numbers for the system.  So, for example, in D&amp;D3/D20 there is a large variance on the die (1 to 20) compared to the range of skill (0 to 8 for starting characters).  On the opposite end, though, you have a game like CORPS -- where skill goes from 1 to 10 or more, and the roll is from 0 to 5 (1d10/2, round down).  In CORPS, there is a huge difference between the average result for skilled and unskilled.  <br/><br/>However, I guess there is a related issue here.  Single-die systems have no bell curve -- so there's no tail to the distribution.  That means that if you have high skill numbers compared to the die size (like in CORPS), you'll get a lot of auto-successes and auto-failures.  A lot of people may find that unsatisfying, and possibly prefer to increase the range of the roll instead.  Or you can just accept a lot of auto-results.  (Incidentally, you can get more tails to the distribution by switching to 2d6 or 3d6, but that complicates the rolling a little.)                        </div>

<p>Victor:</p>
<p>Ah, so it looks like you are doing a sort of reverse-TFT mechanic. <em>The Fantasy Trip</em> (Steve Jackson's pre-GURPS RPG) had players roll a variable number of d6s and add the results to roll under one of three attributes: ST, DX or IQ. More diffult tasks rolled more dice, while talents subtracted dice.</p>
<p>In contrast, you have the number of dice based on skill, rolling (under?) against the score of the challenge. Also, it sounds like you have contests between players resolved by each player rolling dice.</p>
<p>Might I make a suggestion? Resolve <em>everything</em> resolved by dice roll vs. dice roll, instead of some things being dice roll vs. challenge rating. Compare the two situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bruno the Badass Barbarian is fighting with Rigomundo Rapscallion. Bruno rolls 1 die + 1 for Ax + 1 for Berserker; Rigomundo rolls 1 die + 2 dice for Master Fencer. 3 dice vs. 3 dice, whoever has the highest sum wins.</li>
<li>Rigomundo tries to open a locked door and rolls 1 die + 1 for Lockpicking vs. the door's 1 die + 2 for Difficult Lock: 2 dice vs. 3 dice, highest sum wins.</li>
</ul>
<p>This has a couple advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>you're only using one mechanic instead of two;</li>
<li>setting challenge difficulties is less arbitrary and seems more organic;</li>
<li>you can do other tricks, like give an extra die to the one with better armor or faster movement.</li>
</ul>
<p>And best yet: you can speed up the computations you were worried about by discarding matching pairs of dice. I rolled a 6, you rolled a 6, so they cancel each other out; keep cancelling matching pairs until none of my dice match any of your dice. NOW compare my total to yours to see who wins.</p>

<p>Because Victor wants a dice sum instead of dice pool.</p>
<p>I think there's no difference in simplicity between contested rolls and roll vs. target number, as far as the <em>roll itself</em> goes. However, how bonuses are calculated is another matter. In the method I proposed, each skill or advantage adds one die, unless you have a skill like "Master (whatever)", which adds two dice. This is simple to keep track of. If you were to substitute roll vs. target and make no other changes, you need to add +3 or +4 to the target number to get the same effect. This is actual math, although it's easy math, as opposed to mere counting dice in the contested rolls approach.</p>
<p>Where roll vs. target number would be better is if Victor decides he wants more variability in difficulties, with some advantages granting only a +1 and others granting a +5 or +6. However, this means there will either be look-up tables to determine value of an advantage or arbitrary GM rulings. If that's what Victor wants for the feel of how the game is run, that's OK, but it's not simpler.</p>
<p>Also, if all resolution uses single rolls vs. target number, then you need to calculate defense scores (using the +3/+4 per die rule) for every player character, to use in PC vs. PC conflicts. Actually, you'd need defense scores for every arena of conflict used in the game (physical, social, mental, and so on.) More complexity.</p>
<p>Again, this might be what Victor wants. I'm just pointing out what these choices will mean.</p>

<p>OH, and I guess I should add that whether this is a roll-over or roll-under system matters, if we're talking dice sum vs. target number. If it's roll-over, the number of dice a character of a given skill has determines what tasks that character automatically succeeds at. Plus, if you assume a character succeeds about 2/3rds of the time for a task that character would deem "ordinary difficulty", you're talking about a 5 or 6 challenge for characters who roll 2 dice, 8 or 9 for characters rolling 3 dice, and so on. What's important here is that the difference between the target and the <em>maximum</em> becomes larger and larger, which could be important if you want extra special effects to occur at 10 points over the target, 20 points over the target, and so on.</p>
<p>If it's roll-under, you have a problem in that low numbers = more challenge, but greater mastery = higher minimum roll. This is why roll-under systems like GURPS and TFT roll under the <em>skill</em> instead of the challenge. It's probably not good to use a roll-under in Victor's proposed system, unless he wants to subtract 1 for every die rolled. Not really a good idea, unless he's adding situational bonuses to the <em>challenge rating</em>, making the challenge easier. No real benefit; I mainly mentioned this because the contested roll approach assumed a roll-over, which works fine for that approach.</p>

To be honest, I'm still not clear on what Victor wants, which is why I wrote up my sketchy understanding in (hopefully) clear terms.  Besides, I's jest pokin' fun.  The difference between what you'd arrived at and <cite>Sorcerer</cite> is dice sum versus highest die.  Which isn't that much of a statistical difference, either.

Eh?  My personal reaction to contested rolls of all kinds is poor.  You have to get two people to be rolling dice.  You need to figure out the bonuses for both sides, sum (or count successes, or do whatever) both sets of dice, and then compare values.  If the dice interact (like dropping matches,) it's that much more effort.  <br/><br/>On the other hand, a skill that would give me a +1 used actively, gives you a -1 when I defend with it.  If I get an extra die, you lose one, or take a penalty die.  All the modifiers get applied in one place, and the die roll is pretty decisive.  <br/><br/>Ultimately, I think it's an aesthetic issue, but that's my position on it.                        </div>
