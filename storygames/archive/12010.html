Don't know of any space exploration focused RPGs.  <br/><br/>- At the beginning players secretly choose 1 of the 10 missions.  They cannot be chosen multiple times.<br/>- During play there are trophies that will change hands based on accomplishing goals, but there's always 1 fewer trophy than number of players (ie. musical trophies)<br/>- The end of the game occurs leaving each player at a major story cliff-hanger<br/>- At the end of the game, all players except 1 will be holding a trophy.  The trophies are ranked, so each player has a victory rank at end of game.<br/>- Your power to narrate your own ending depends on a) Your trophy rank and b) your mission type<br/><br/>For example: 5 players.  There are 4 trophies, ranked 1-4.  The end of the game occurs when the last player arrives at his major cliff hanger.  Now you look at the trophies to see how everyone's story get narrated:<br/><br/>Player with no trophy: Failure -- everyone else narrates the 4 elements of his ending<br/>Player with 4th trophy: Minor success -- can narrate 1 ending element, but the rest is up to 3 others<br/>3rd trophy: Success with sacrifice -- can narrate half of your ending, rest is narrated by 2 other players<br/>2nd trophy: Major success -- narrate most of your ending, with 1 player able to add one element to it<br/>1st trophy: Total victory -- narrate your own ending<br/><br/>The type of mission gives a few limitations that must be followed during the narration of the ending.<br/><br/>I was also thinking maybe you start with the guy who has no tropies and work forward.  That way the "losing" players get a chance to squeeze in the best stuff they can before the total victor gets to narrate the grand finale.  It will provide him with a challenge to get the kind of ending he wants while still maintaining whatever narrative consistency he can with the endings previously narrated.<br/><br/>-- John M.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268788">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wburdick" title="wburdick"><img alt="wburdick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wburdick">wburdick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268788/#Comment_268788" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-24T13:22:48+00:00" title="April 24, 2010  1:22PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds neat!<br/><br/>It seems to me that 4 trophies is equivalent to 5 trophies, where the 5th one is the "loser trophy".

I hadn't figured that out yet, but it causes me to think: would it even make sense for a sci-fi explorer game to be competitive anyway? My initial brainstorm was to make it competitive so that players would be able to design both starship captain characters and antagonist roles and factions for conflicts so that during play the game would feel like the player who is the captain is exploring the universe (as it's being created).  Maybe a GM or having it be cooperative in some way would work better though, but I don't see for any particular reason at this point.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DanielSolis</cite><br/>If you want to sweeten the "loser" role a little more, you can let the loser decide when he can take his turn.
