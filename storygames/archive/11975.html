Have you considered...<br/><br/>* Splitting into smaller groups - two groups of 3-5 people might be easier to manage in terms of scheduling. Put folks with like schedules into the same mini-group.<br/>* Running games that work with smaller numbers of players - <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/dogs.html" rel="nofollow">Dogs in the Vineyard</a> works swell with just 3 players and a GM, and <a href="http://thou-and-one.blogspot.com/2006/01/kazekami-kyoko-kills-kublai-khan.html" rel="nofollow">KKKKK</a> works for just two players<br/>* Running one-shot games as opposed to trying to start a campaign or limited story-arc - one shot games obviously require less investment in terms of pitching up regularly.<br/>* Running games where the fact that the same players don't trun up every week is catered for by the system?

My current solution is a Mutants and Masterminds campaign that is extremely episodic, to the point where the same players won't have to turn up from one session to the next.

The nature of the internet dramatically reduces the cost of participation, which is only good if your goal can be achieved by lots of people doing only one thing, only one time.  (A good example of this would be Wikipedia: it's easier, faster, and produces better results when ten thousand people each write one article than it is when ten people try to write a thousand articles apiece.)<br/><br/>But if your goal is something which requires more commitment, like coming to a weekly game...well, that's not really the kind of group that the internet is good at creating.  The entry cost to joining a Facebook group is just too low to select for that kind of dedication.  Internet groups can be great at <i>maintaining</i> that sort of group after you've assembled one, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267827/#Comment_267827" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-19T11:40:09+00:00" title="April 19, 2010 11:40AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This requires a LOT of persistence.

EDIT TO ADD: I think maybe <i>Lacuna</i> is also like that.<br/><br/>Another idea: I ran 52 straight weeks of <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> as a "floating campaign", where each session was a one-shot, but they all took place in the same continuity. I ran the game for whichever 4-8 people wanted to play on a given Saturday. This works best if the GM holds on to the sheets, I think - in fact, I just re-located my thick folder of everyone's character sheets, sorted by player name, last week, so I have a kickass treasure trove of fully-statted NPC sheets again (maybe a hundred of them!). Character "advancement" in CoC is a wash, so a new character could be thrown into a party of five veteran investigators, and not be at any real disadvantage.<br/><br/>That aside, my other suggestion is to make yourself a brand - "I promise that if you show up, we'll play something fun." Always have three games scouted out and ready for a given session, one for 2-3 players, one for 4-6 players, and some idea of what you'd do with more.

I hammered home the idea that we will play, every Thursday, at this location and time.  I worked my butt off to make sure the first couple of sessions were rockin' hard.  (I even had a friend come to help me run NPCs at the first session, which worked great.)  I'm good about emailing, communicating with the group in general, making announcements at the start of each session, asking for feedback, that sort of thing.  I've also shown time and again that I respect when it's getting late, when we need to wrap, and that I'm good at pacing that sort of thing (in general, combat in 4E can be a little time-bloaty, but that's another thread).<br/><br/>One PC and a few NPCs have come and gone but five players have been in the game since the beginning, and I only allow six at a time, so that's pretty damn good.  (And the guy who stopped PCing came back and NPC'd for awhile when his schedule allowed, even helping me plan out a major area for sandbox play, which was amazing.)<br/><br/>I haven't socialized with everyone from the group outside of the game quite as much as I'd like, but I have seen everyone outside the normal game at least once for a one-shot, and two of the players I see fairly often at other events (most NerdNYC stuff, also Dreamation in one case).<br/><br/>Mind you, if I simply wanted to start a gaming club, where we meet every week to try out a different one-shot game, I'd've taken a very different approach.  Make sure *you* know what kind of club you want to start.  I think the two are very different.  (There's a thread around here somewhere where Jenskot talks about how people who want to play trad games actually seem much more likely to commit, and commit hard, than indie gamers.)<br/><br/>I have a whole rant about scheduling games.  The short version basically boils down to: it's not, generally speaking, more of a commitment to game than it is to sing in a community choir (something I've also done in a few different contexts).  And of course there are always things that will be more important than either gaming or choir, causing you to miss a session / rehearsal: sudden loss of job, medical emergency, hell, even more normal sickness.  The real issue is when people prioritize gaming lower than all other social activities, so that it always winds up losing out.  (Related to this is that people would rather do something like gaming with their friends, which is why it's important to reach out to your players and befriend them.)<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268037">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kate%20Bullock" title="Kate Bullock"><img alt="Kate Bullock" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/369/nDTB5PI7ZR748.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kate%20Bullock">Kate Bullock</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268037/#Comment_268037" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-21T06:48:30+00:00" title="April 21, 2010  6:48AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A few years ago a local guy in my town started a meetup group for Gamers in the Toronto area even though the Toronto Role-Players Association already existed. I joined the little club of about six members. We would get together once a month or so for a social at a pub and organize games online by posting events.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's about six years later. Through perseverance, thorough organizing and being dogged about posting events, making new events, having a steady stream of campaigns and one-shots, our club is at 350 members or so, beating out the much older TRPA. If you want to run a gaming club, the key is to post one-shots or social events people will come out. Then you'll find your active members and just boot out any non-active members to keep your club clear of 'clutter'. That being said, it is a level of dedication that you have to be prepared to make.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a club, we have about ten - twelve organizers on the board that are constantly working to make the club more efficient, keep it clear of unwanted clutter (bad members, unwanted behaviour, inactive members, etc), keep events going, and keep members happy by listening to their needs. It is basically a job I have that I don't get paid for. The amount of flak you get from members is sometimes alarming. But we keep a high number of organizers to keep the club running smoothly (ish) and to keep new ideas flowing. The main thing we found in drawing people out was a monthly social that had board games, card games, and the odd one-shot. We also have a board game monthly, an rpg monthly, and several rpg one-shots a month.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would not recommend starting a club unless you're prepared for the responsibility if it happens to grow beyond any expectations you have.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you start one, post events on that facebook group in a more public setting. If people come out, cool. If not, well, you have your answer as to how many on the facebook group are going to be gaming. or do a pub night where people can rsvp yes/no and there's no big risk because it's at a pub. Call it a "Meet and Greet" if you want.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
