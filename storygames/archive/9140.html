It might be necessary for a game to involve no randomizers at all to qualify, but I'm not entirely sure.<br/><br/><br/>(Very nearly every non-Scandinavian game I've seen relies on quantifying abstract things and comparing them. But I know it is possible to design games without any numbers involved.  So I want to see other people do that, and see what wealth of options people can come up with in a different mode.  What sort of conflict resolution can you do if you cannot compare the values of the opponent's stats?  That sort of thing.  I may not be explaining it very well, though.  And it may work better worked into a larger design contest... say, used as a design constraint for some Game Chef like thingy, where you'd also get some sort of non-rules based constraints.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_202166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202166/#Comment_202166" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-15T12:56:23+00:00" title="April 15, 2009 12:56PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, here's my entry:<br/><b>The Total Party Kill Game Design Contest</b><br/>Rules:<br/>1) The game must invariably result in the death of any player character within one game session or less.<br/>2) The game must be fun to play.<br/>3) The game must be designed in 2 weeks or less.<br/>4) The game should involve "traditional" rpg tropes such as "adventuring" in some kind of enclosed space (dungeon, temple, mines, castle, etc.)<br/>5) The game must have a GM<br/>6) The GM should be able to "plan" an "adventure" in no more than 15 minutes.<br/>7) Character creation should take no more than 5 minutes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/markv" title="markv"><img alt="markv" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/markv">markv</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202168/#Comment_202168" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-15T13:15:18+00:00" title="April 15, 2009  1:15PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            one I've thought about&gt;<br/><br/>\u2018Documentary games\u2019 contest. <br/><br/>Design a game about a topic, preferably a real world topic.

It can also include Website effectiveness and online presence.<br/>\nf) Clarity of Text...the judges will play at least 1 session of your game in which they will evaluate the degree to which all of their questions about how to play are answered by your text.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf this contest is picked and someone organizes it, I will personally offer a $500 prize and a full page ad in a future Ramshead product to the winner.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSee, to me THAT's a contest...recognizing the shit, sucks all to hell gruntwork that kicks in after the fun creative part ends -- The blood sweat and tears of actual craftsmanship is what seperates a game-design from a game-design-idea<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don't hate and despise your game by the time its finished...it ain't finished.

Your guidelines can lay out the <i>bases</i> for such agreement (e.g. "accept contributions that inspire you" or "accept contributions that seem logical") as long as they don't grant any specific authorities that impinge upon "free social agreement among players".<br><br>Your job as a designer is to enable the play group to decide "what happens now?" at every instant of play despite the lack of a structured arbitration process.<br><br>Entries need not include traditional player-character relationships.  "Storytelling games" are fine.  GMs also optional.<br><br>Here are some ingredients to choose from when concocting the purpose of your game's fiction.  You do not have to use one; this is just to help get you thinking:<br>assemble<br>deconstruct<br>emulate<br>innovate<br>mash up<br>pervert<br>satirize<br>simulate<br>worship<br><br>Submissions may not contain images, but feel free to do whatever you want with type and layout thereof.<br><br>Judging will take place in two stages.  Stage one evaluates presentation, stage two evaluates play.  <br><br>In stage one, 2 "official" judges will get the ball rolling by announcing which of the entries they'd like to play, in order from "most want to play" (10pts) to "just barely want to play" (1pt).  Stage one judging will then remain open for one week, during which anyone can vote.  At the end of stage one, the judges will tabulate the votes and list the vote totals for all games.  The top vote-getter will win "best presentation", and the runner-up will also be acknowledged.<br/><br/>In stage two, having seen which games generated the most interest, people will play the games and rate how well they played.  The official judges must play the "best presentation" winner.  Anyone who plays a game and rates it (again, 1-10) gets a free copy of the game they played if it is ever published.  Ratings should be based on (1) how playable the game was, and (2) how much fun was had, tempered by judgment of how much of the fun was really supported by the game itself.  Stage two will last for one month after stage one.  At the end of stage two, ratings will be tallied and a "best game" winner will be announced.<br/><br/>Rule I'd include if surveys found it to be non-prohibitive: to be eligible to win in stage two, you must play another contest game and rate it.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_202193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko" title="Seth Drebitko"><img alt="Seth Drebitko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w135/sethbashwinger/fetusgoplayavatar-2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko">Seth Drebitko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202193/#Comment_202193" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-15T15:22:00+00:00" title="April 15, 2009  3:22PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would say in a contest I would look to see:<br/>\n<br/>\nWritten by who?<br/>\n<br/>\n-All participants must have never published for profit (most gamers have written a game) any role playing game or game supplement.<br/>\n-No \u201ctheme\u201d will be set in place.<br/>\n-Max page length 130 with 6 x 9 book size<br/>\n<br/>\nProducts will only be considered if they are print ready professional books.<br/>\n<br/>\n1st place wins 20 free copies of their book (judges will be given copies of the books but these will not come out of the winners 20)<br/>\n2nd wins 15 free copies of there book (judges will be given copies of the books but these will not come out of the winners 15)<br/>\n3rd wins 10 free copies of there book (judges will be given copies of the books but these will not come out of the winners 10)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe winners would agree to provide 2 pages of advertising (not included in the max page count) to advertise for the printing company (in hopes of better rates) and the host of the <br/>\ncontest. <br/>\n<br/>\n(I might myself want to run this some time)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202194/#Comment_202194" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-15T15:30:48+00:00" title="April 15, 2009  3:30PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The RPG Contest Contest Contest <br/><br/>Make the most entertaining and highly responded to thread about a contest for making a contest!

You cannot previously have posted about it online or talked about it at cons, etc. It's fine if you've had the idea in your head before the start of the contest, though. You just can't have done any sort of work on it yet. <br/>2) You have a year at most to design and publish a complete game. The contest starts on a specific date in one year, and ends at that date the next year. People can join at any time during the year -- in fact, no one even has to announce that they are participating, though they are free to do so.<br/>3) You are free to use whatever resources you have at your disposal in creating the game, including online discussion. However, any public discussions should reference the contest, so that other people can hear about it and join in.<br/><br/><b>Finalist Qualifications</b><br/>After the year of designing, your game must meet the following conditions in order to be judged:<br/>1) You must have a published game. (The exact definition of "published" will need to be hammered out before the contest starts, but will almost certainly include free PDFs.)<br/>2) You must have a detailed document of the creation of your game from start to finish.<br/>3) You must have at least three examples of actual play posted online. <br/><br/><b>Scoring</b><br/>50% - Depth and subjective quality of the documentation of your design journey.<br/>25% - Number and subjective value of actual play examples. <br/>15% - Subjective quality of game mechanics and setting (if any).<br/>10% - Subjective quality of the game as a product. <br/><br/>That's all I've got at the moment. I'd really like to offer to front a prize on this one, but my current financial status is pretty horrible, so I certainly can't commit to anything like that. If things change, so would that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202218/#Comment_202218" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-15T19:42:18+00:00" title="April 15, 2009  7:42PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know what would be even more awesome than Prize Money...is if enough people contributed to it that it became a grant large enough to pay for a nice size print run, or the art budget, or whatever.

Providing simple resources for the matter like one-page handouts, "quickstart" scenarios, example questions and answers or a list of common misunderstandings, something like BW's modular design that you can introduce in increments as players get used to each subsystem, etc. This includes explaining the details of a novel setting to them, as well as explaining how the system works. Also, complexity will be used as a tie-breaker: if two games explain how to teach themselves equally well, the one that has more to teach will be judged better.<br/><br/>(Inspired by thinking about how many gaming groups work under the assumption that one person will buy and read the actual book, and then be responsible for teaching everyone else everything about the game.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202236/#Comment_202236" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-16T01:44:09+00:00" title="April 16, 2009  1:44AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Off the Cuff game awards.</b><br/><br/>This contest is for games designed using thread titles on a roleplaying forum.

The writer of the game is welcome to start threads in the hope that they get an interesting juxtaposition but cannot be the latest poster in the thread.<br/><br/>The game must also use at least four further juxtapostions as inspiration. These must come from the same forum (see above for acceptable sources) and must be no more than one year old. Juxtapostions can come from the main page, sub-pages or the new threads page. There must be no more than a week between subsequent posts. Again, documentary proof is required of each juxtapostion. Image alteration is not allowed.<br/><br/>Points will be awarded on the basis of how well these juxtapostions are integrated into the game rather than just used as colour.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_202432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202432/#Comment_202432" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-17T08:13:03+00:00" title="April 17, 2009  8:13AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>The Happy Song Game Design Contest</b><br/><br/>The Japanese RPG <a href="http://www.sunsetgames.co.jp/rpg/youyake/youyake.htm" rel="nofollow">Yuuyake Koyake</a> is a heartwarming game, partly inspired by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxoHcVgo_dg" rel="nofollow">a Japanese children's song</a> about the setting sun and walking home hand-in-hand.<br/><br/>For this contest, you pick out a children's song and design a heartwarming role-playing game that is in some way inspired by it.

My solution is tidier and just asks designers to put up a small amount of cash to reimburse the judges and to pay the grant to the winner.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213409/#Comment_213409" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-19T11:15:28+00:00" title="June 19, 2009 11:15AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, hey... get a room, guys.
