However, in the spirit of talking about what I will get pissed off about if a publisher pulls, I'd say the few things I really expect to the degree that I could maybe be pressed into calling them consumer rights when I was pissed and talking loudly would be: <br/><br/>1) That I not be fucking lied to in order to get me to purchase the damn thing. This can include all sorts of bait-and-switch marketing to things like glossy covers on books with deliberately cheep fucking binding to big lists of playtesters who are all secretly your friends to having your brother put up fake reviews of its awesomeness on RPG.net. If your game hasn't been edited by a professional I may forgive you, as long as you don't tell me it was. <br/><br/>2) That all the pieces, parts, components and necessary gadgets of the game that are said to be included with the game are. If you tell me I need 3000 d4s and they are obviously not included, awesome. If you tell me the boxed set has everything I need to play, but doesn't have the dice I need, you suck toe. If you accidentally leave out the whole combat section of the book, you suck something worse than toe. I may forgive you for this if you get me the replacement parts, files, or information for free or really, really cheap (like, say, a free upgrade .pdf or the 7th Sea book that came out free at FLGS to make up for the suck of the main books).<br/><br/>3) Also, I expect the pieces and parts to be of a quality commensurate with the price of the product. If you give me "cards" printed on plain printer paper and you're a $2.50 Cheap Ass Game, well... okay. But give me the same cards and charge me $75 and I will find you one night in a dark ally and exercise my consumer rights upside your head. Of course, I also kinda think maybe I should have done some research on that (caveat emptor, right?), but fuck, we're talking about expectations of consumers, not their responsibilities.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171637/#Comment_171637" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-27T00:31:02+00:00" title="September 27, 2008 12:31AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>It is emphatically<i>not</i>for discussion of what people<i>shouldn't</i>expect</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>I'd laught at anybody who phrased these more or less reasonable expectations as their "rights" when dealing with me. </blockquote>\nI see we're off to a good start.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171638/#Comment_171638" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-27T00:36:42+00:00" title="September 27, 2008 12:36AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 27, 2008 12:38AM by Matthijs.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let's call them <i>reasonable expectations</i>, then, not rights, if that helps.

For what it's worth, you probably can't actually discuss the issue without also discussing its limits - otherwise you're just listing things with no back and forth.<br/><br/>I myself tend to have very low expectations of games - I certainly don't expect them to playtested in a specific manner or come in a specific quality package. I'm appreciative if they do, though, and I do hold some specific brands to specific standards. For example, I do expect at this point that any WotC game book I check out will have abundant glitzy American power fantasy illustrations in color. Likewise, I expect a game that has gained a positive endorsement from one of the few people whose evaluative ability I respect to have been thought through in a complete and sensible manner. And I expect that a fantasy game with lots of different races and separate magic and combat subsystems will be dull as shit. Lots of different expectations going on here.<br/><br/>I wouldn't call these expectations any sort of baseline for consumer ethics, though; they're just what I've grown accustomed to. As for what I'd <i>like</i> for people to expect and demand, it'd be kinda nice if the basic supposition with rpgs were that you're getting a fully designed game with game-interactions explicitly specified instead of a vaguely imitative piece of fanfic wrapped in expensive art and lots of unsaid assumptions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171642/#Comment_171642" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-27T01:17:26+00:00" title="September 27, 2008  1:17AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me, having high expectations as a customer is coupled directly with good design.

If a large enough - or significant enough - group of people promotes these expectations, they will become recognized as rights.<br/><br/>I would certainly be wary of dealing with someone who believes the only rights a customer has are those explicitly spelled out by whatever consumer laws are currently in effect in his home jurisdiction.<br/><br/>I would suggest updating your original list to add Brand-Robins points - though all could be covered by one case concerning misrepresentation.<br/><br/>Also, number 1 is really part of number 3 (since "works" is a subjective term). And number 2 is vague and ultimately pointless unless you change it into some kind of satisfaction guarantee - and, while important, those are almost never considered a consumer "right" because they are equally subjective (and open to abuse).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171648/#Comment_171648" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-27T03:00:33+00:00" title="September 27, 2008  3:00AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Does you expectation change if you're getting something for free? <br/><br/>I guess I could go either way on that.  Like, I don't see that there's a fundamental difference between something that's published for free, and something that's published for $50.  I guess my expectation is that the author has created something they're proud of, and that what they're expecting from me in return is what they believe is reasonable.  So I guess I don't have a hard set of criteria for what I expect of a product, I just expect the producer of that product, the artist, to have some integrity about the product.  <br/><br/>Part of that's tied to what Brand was saying.  It sucks to feel like a chump, especially in this hobby where no one's really making buckets of money, and we're all in it for the love.  Any money I spend on some asshole is money that won't be going to someone more deserving.  <br/><br/>So if your product has shoddy bindings and there's typos everywhere, but you're proud of it, and you don't hide its flaws, then I'm happy to buy it for what it is.  If you can't get anyone to playtest your game because no-one's heard of you before, but you need $5 to cover the cost of printing a playtest rulebook, I'm cool with that.  So I guess it comes down to this: I expect the artist to love what they've produced.  If they don't love it, they shouldn't be publishing it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171650/#Comment_171650" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-27T03:52:45+00:00" title="September 27, 2008  3:52AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some of the reactions in this and other related threads baffle me, but I think it's because people envision different situations when discussing this.<br/><br/>One situation seems to be something like this: A big, red-faced, self-important geek (customer) is shouting "I have RIGHTS, you know!

If you don't want to ever deal with semi-offended smug-liberal guy, don't publish. <br/><br/>Furthermore, on the business ethics front, I expect that any personal information you get from me if I order games of correspond with your about your games will not be sold to third parties. Do not take the information from my customer comments card, emails, or mail order forms and use them to compile mailing lists that you sell to others, give out to spammers, or even make available for other publishers who you think I might like. This is some high order bullshit, and while I haven't seen it be a problem in recent years, back in the day there were a couple of mid-level RPG companies that did this. <br/><br/>On the "really, really not a right, but something that I expect on the level of pure assumption" front: I think most of the time when I buy a game these days that there will be some kind of web support for the game. I'm not even talking about being Luke and setting up whole fucking communities here, but I do expect that there will be things like .pdfs of character sheets, any current errata, maybe a yahoo group. I certainly don't think publishers should be mandated to do this, but not having it will shock me and leave me rather nonplussed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage" title="Number6intheVillage"><img alt="Number6intheVillage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.johnkantor.com/miscl/prisoner_ringtiny.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage">Number6intheVillage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171689/#Comment_171689" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-27T12:31:00+00:00" title="September 27, 2008 12:31PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Talking about physical attributes of a game - I think making it readable would be great.

The last chapter, and the appendix, say Chapter Two across the bottom.  Plus the book has the same barcode/ISBN as an earlier book in the line.

Of course, you'll also never get what you want. <br/><br/>Thinking on this thread is odd to me, because I very much have a negative reaction to talk of consumer rights. I grew up with parents who taught me that as a consumer it was my job to take care of myself, and unless there was fraud going on, if I bought crap it was on me for not being careful, forward thinking, or patient enough. I think I knew the words "caveat emptor" when I was 5. Consumers have the right to buy or not buy, to not be defrauded, and to band together to buy or not buy and use that as leverage... and that's about it. <br/><br/>However, thinking about that from where I am in life now, really looking at why the initial title of this thread caused me to get all hedgehog, I think that may well be fucked up. Its such a neo-con capitalist based logical center, that I locate rights in the producers of material and responsibilities in the consumers of it. Which really, in ever so many ways, goes against pretty much every other, more conscious, political impulse I've got.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171763/#Comment_171763" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-28T12:22:01+00:00" title="September 28, 2008 12:22PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brand: I don't think that I have no expectations, and I get what I want quite often.<br/><br/>I do this by playing games before buying them.

And the designer/publisher can impact this by ordering a proof, ensuring that they take references from other publishers on the quality of product and that they have a pre-considered a strategy should things go wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, there is nothing the designer can do to ensure that you like the game, or that it fits with your style of play, or that every single person will 100% guaranteed have fun with the game. Its impossible. Thats where taste, style and aptitude come into it. Now, designers can help the consumer by providing clear examples and information about the game and encouraging AP reports etc. The consumer can help themselves by doing some research - with primary (ala Ben) or secondary. However, you cannot mitigate the fact that for every Spirit of the Century (a game that just *clicked* for me) there is a Nobilis (which I simply cannot comprehend)<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage" title="Number6intheVillage"><img alt="Number6intheVillage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.johnkantor.com/miscl/prisoner_ringtiny.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage">Number6intheVillage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171814/#Comment_171814" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-28T21:02:47+00:00" title="September 28, 2008  9:02PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 28, 2008 9:05PM by Number6intheVillage.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite><br>When I break this rule, I do tend to be disappointed.

It's just that they might be disappointed."<br/><br/>I personally think it's up to the consumer look out for themselves and check out what they're buying first. How often have I heard that "oh, it wasn't what I thought it was". Well, who's fault is it that it wasn't what you thought it was?<br/><br/>I feel it's the publisher's fault if you're all snake oil and chicanery selling something that isn't what it is. Or baiting and switching. But it's the consumer's fault if they didn't bother to check out what they were spending their money on in the first place.<br/><br/>I find Ben saying "When I break this rule, I do tend to be disappointed." interesting. My gut feeling is that you're equally as likely to get something of a pleasant surprise as a nasty one when going in blind. But maybe it's the allure of something fuzzy that you think you'll probably like that biases that?<br/><br/>I'm a glass-half-full kind of guy. For my money I expect to get some enjoyment or value. Whether that's a playable game or not depends on whether I'm going to end up playing it or not. I mean I bought Dark Heresy with no intention of running or playing it -- but I wanted it for the stuff. I enjoyed the stuff in it so it was worth it.<br/><br/>I remember the days before the internet so I don't need to be so in touch with the author or whatever to make a purchase work for me.
