                    When I first came to indie nar games, one of my first impressions was that the majority of people on the scene had substantial GM experience behind their belts, and that this was a powerful influence towards trends in design like redistributed responsibility among the group to share traditional GM roles like setting creation, scene framing, GM authority etc.<br/><br/>My local gaming scene is a people with widely mixed experience, who all came to gaming in different ways, but most of which met each other through LARP (Some of those folks still LARP, but the biggest body of game that happens these days is tabletop). Of this group, about half of the players have little or no GM experience at all. In my experience, this has been one of the biggest obstacles that I've faced in introducing indie nar games to this group: many games take the ability to GM for granted, and require a set of skills or abilities that non GM players have never tried to use.<br/><br/>Until very recently, I was right there with them. My GMing experience can be listed on one hand, with some digits left over: I tried to run a game of Tribe 8 for one, then two, then three players, managed to get about five sessions out before the game fell apart. I ran a game of Tribe 8 for two players, one of which was the focus character that was moderately more successful, and finally, I have been running a solo nar game for Brand using a patched version of Unknown Armies. This last one is the first game I consider successful, and the only one that has run long term. Just last month, we realized that the game has been going for over a year, and that we've had more than 20 sessions in play averaging about 5 hours of game in each session, and Brand is loving it (or so he says) and the feedback from the people I bounce ideas off of it, point to me doing something rightish.<br/><br/>It's only in second half of those that I feel that I'm in a real kind of GM stride, and have begun, in small bits and pieces to have fun while I do it. I've discovered that I kick ass at building and working a relationship map, and much to my amazement, that to some extent, and with some well hones skills, GM's can run immersively.<br/><br/>I think I'm going to start a couple of threads on this, but for this first one, I'm calling out all the people who are in or have been in the same boat that I have. If you have very limited or no GM experience and have never really felt you owned the title of  GM, I want to hear from you.
<ul>
<li>What kind of experience do you have in a GM role?</li>
<li>Do you play hippy games, and if so, do you think that you have had a different experience with them than others because you have not historically been a GM?</li>
<li>Have you played any hippy games where traditional GM responsibilities were shared by all players in lieu of a GM  (E.g. Polaris)? If so, do you feel the game supported you with the new functions you had to fulfill, or do you feel it just assumed you had the skills to do it?</li>
<li>Have you made any attempts to GM any of these new fangled hippy games (that still have GM roles, e.g. Dogs)? If so, do you think that it was more or less daunting than it would have been to attempt a traditional game? </li>
<li>Do you even want to learn to GM?</li>
<li>If your first attempts at GMing were in a post-hippy exposure world, do you think that you are (or will be) helped or hindered in your efforts to learn GMing because of your lack of experience in traditional games?</li>
</ul>

<p>Mo, I'm gonna pretend you didn't say nar so I can answer this.</p>
<p><em>What kind of experience do you have in a GM role?</em></p>
<p>I've run a couple of one-shots, and a sort of terribly disjointed D&amp;D game back in the day.</p>
<p>Universally it has not been so good. Being in this Other-role makes me feel disconnected and excluded from the rest of the players, and not in a good way. These games gave me the authority to fill the world with things that excited me, but I didn't have the connection necessary to feel like I was a <em>participant</em> in something bigger. It felt like I was a tyrant or a performer.</p>
<p><em>Do you play [games that require non-traditional skill sets], and if so, do you think that you have had a different experience with them than others because you have not historically been a GM?</em></p>
<p>Yes, very much so. In games that give all the players more or less the same responsibilities and powers, I feel much more a part of the game; my input is less constrained than when I am character-acting in a GM-game, and it's checked-and-balanced by other players so that I do not feel I am steamrolling their input.</p>
<p><em>Have you played any hippy games where traditional GM responsibilities were shared by all players in lieu of a GM (E.g. Polaris)? If so, do you feel the game supported you with the new functions you had to fulfill, or do you feel it just assumed you had the skills to do it?</em></p>
<p>The portrayal skills associated with GM-powers...like juggling multiple characters, making functional, interesting environments, etc., are things that I hadn't thought about support for, because I am pretty much happy with where I am.</p>
<p>Structural skills like pacing, and mechanical skills like calibrating fit opposition, these I feel are porly supported by many games and it frustrates me greatly, because I feel these are weaknesses of mine.</p>
<p><em>Have you made any attempts to GM any of these new fangled hippy games (that still have GM roles, e.g. Dogs)? If so, do you think that it was more or less daunting than it would have been to attempt a traditional game?</em></p>
<p>Agon. Much less daunting. It's got a lot of the support I need, and tools to save me brain-work even for skills I do have. I think I may also have run Shadows, which is a much lighter game, consisting only of procedures and being very light on the support, but it also calls for fewer skills. Again, this is much less daunting than running a mechanically and descriptively interesting game of D&amp;D or something of the kind.</p>
<p><em>Do you even want to learn to GM?</em></p>
<p>Not if I can avoid it.</p>

                            Yes, I have GM'd.  Sorcerer.  It was a five-shot, or something.  The most important lesson I learned was to let go of the plot, when necessary.<br/>Yes, I play hippy games.  I tend not to analyse the mechanics and therefore don't build characters specifically to be strong in that setting.  I tend to live in the moment rather than plan ahead.<br/>Yes, I love Polaris!  I've even organised groups of it.  The game supports play very well.  It did take a session playing with Ben and Paul T. to really get the hang of pushing the heart when I'm the mistaken.  It was the realisation that this made a much better, more interesting game than not pushing that allowed me to really get into it.<br/>No, I have not GM'd hippy games like Dogs.<br/>Maybe.  I don't know if I do or not.  It's not something I'm particularly strong at.  I'd hate to waste peoples' time while I bumbled about trying to figure out what works and what doesn't.  I'm definitely stronger when I have other people to bounce off of (like when playing with many people) and I don't know if I can incorporate that skill into GMing.  It occurs to me that maybe I should just make a relationship map, and have the different characters have goals, and then just play like another player, except on the other side.  That way I'm not "controlling" the plot, I'm playing it out.  I'll have to think about this.<br/><br/>--Nancy                        </div>

                            Shreyas, <br/><br/>Some interesting stuff there. Some followup questions:<br/><br/>Do you, because you have a different experience than others in the context of hippy games (because of your lack of GM experience) feel like your take on the subject is different than others? Do you feel friction with the community because of it? How do you think it affects your design?<br/><br/>"calibrating fit opposition" I like this description.

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite><em>Do you even want to learn to GM?</em>Not if I can avoid it.</blockquote>
Heh. Why not?<br/><br/>And not off what you said, but I'm going to add it anyway... do you feel like you have skills as a non-player GM that maybe GM/players might not have? If so, what are they, and do they compliment or conflict with your attempts to play hippy games?                        </div>

That drag and drop of text works<br/>
I have done something similar, using Excel spreadsheets and essentially a matrix (i self classify as more GM than player btw) and I really like the idea of the map (more a relationship diagram than a matrix style that i have done) and wanted to say Thanks for such a great idea.                        </div>

Interesting. Did you find it daunting to play in new skills with people who have them already developed?

That's exactly how I've come around to GMing, and how I'm starting to find fun in it. I build webs of broken desperate impassioned people who all want strong things both in general and from the PC's and then let them bang about like chimes when the PC, the wind, comes through.                        </div>

<p>I do feel like my take on the subject is different than that of others - particularly, since I don't really have any <em>functional</em> trad GM experience (on <em>either</em> side of the relationship), I do not design systems that contain that relationship. It is outside my universe of options.</p>
<p>I don't feel like this creates a lot of community friction, though. We are all self-aware enough to separate preference from...that other thing that's bad.</p>

<p>That is, selecting opposition that provides the appropriate amount of resistance, in an interesting way. Like, to make a D&amp;D analogy, you simply <em>do not</em> send a 1st-level party to fight a dragon, of any age. It will be a slaughter in two rounds or less, and the players will be bored.</p>
<p>Similarly you do not send regular rank-and-file skeletons up against 20th level characters; it'll be a slaughter in the other direction, and not engage the players tactically.</p>
<p>And, by the same token, you take the characters' abilities into account - you get a <em>lot</em> more tactical interest from flying opponents if you have some characters that can also fly or use ranged attacks.</p>
<p>D&amp;D in its various versions has done things to support it, but its mechanical complexity makes its calibration tools weak at the knees. They function as weak-voiced suggestions, rather than confident advisors.</p>
<p>I got an appointment, I'll get back to this in a couple of hours!</p>

                            Hey tad,<br/><br/>Not to get sidetracked in the conversation, but just as an aside. Brand gave me some guidance on building maps (this may have come from from somewhere else, so nobody dogpile me for mis-crediting) Is to throw out a bunch of characters and then find one of four reasons for them to be involved: by Blood , Violence, Money or Sex. If they can't be connected by any of those things, then they don't get connected at all. Then the characters are given goals that they want in the world and what they want from the PC (kind of like town creation in Dogs), and an obsession a noble and a fear stimulus like in Unknown Armies. The goals are optimally contradictory between the NPC's and the stimuli often are contradictory in the characters, to make demanding, unreasonable, broken, deperate people who will push and pull on the PC as dynamically as possible.<br/><br/>Then in each game, I take a look at what the PC did last session and look for repercussions along the Blood, Violence, Money or Sex lines that I've connected, and throw the repercussions out at the player, and play the PC's as hard as I can.Optimally I like to have two or three small localities on the Relationship map so that one episode will focus in one area, and that area causes just enough of a ripple to get the next locality involved for the next session. Hope that makes sense.<br/><br/>If you want to see my working map, I'll send it via email, if you give me an address.                        </div>

                            I'm the one that always gets tapped as GM in traditional games.

I hate it; "Entertain me, screen monkey!"*.  I enjoy playing more, and my attention has been really captured by the indie-"hippy" scene.

<b>What kind of experience do you have in a GM role?</b><br/><br/>Zero.

If so, do you think that it was more or less daunting than it would have been to attempt a traditional game?</b><br/><br/>I'm going to be running The Mountain Witch in a couple of weeks, and it's a lot less daunting to me than running a traditional game.  It's meant to be a short game, I've got a McGuffin already set, and the setting is one that I'm somewhat familiar with.  It's kind of like making a cake from a mix -- there's room for improvisation, but I don't have to worry so much that I'm measuring all the ingredients correctly. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  It's also less daunting because I feel like I can trust my players to take the idea and run with it.<br/><br/><b>Do you even want to learn to GM?</b><br/><br/>I do.  I feel a little nervous about it, since almost all the other people I play with have been gaming for years and have GMed at least once or twice.  But they all seem pretty excited that I'm wanting to take it on.  I don't think I'd ever want to GM ALL the time, though, since the kind of fun one gets from GMing seems to be substantially different from just being a player.<br/><br/><b>If your first attempts at GMing were in a post-hippy exposure world, do you think that you are (or will be) helped or hindered in your efforts to learn GMing because of your lack of experience in traditional games?</b><br/><br/>Hard to say.  I think I personally will be helped by my non-traditional gaming, in that I feel like it helps me see out of the box, but it might be difficult when it comes to dealing with the preconceptions of people who've done a lot of trad games.  What I mean is, not having the preconceptions myself is probably a good thing, but it's also going to mean that I don't have a good handle on what might be confusing or frustrating for people who're used to more traditional gaming.                        </div>

                            Mo,<br/><br/>I didn't find it daunting in this case because of my fellow players, who were great role models and very good at working with what I threw out.  They're also really great at positive reinforcement, so the closer I got, the more involved and excited they got, and when it finally clicked, it was most intense.  I think it could have been intimidating with people who are not so good at teaching others.  I could see how if all I received was negative reinforcement, or no excellent examples, that I might never have learned that skill.  Unfortunately, I'm not so good at setting it up as an example to other people.  In a later group, my heart (for whom I was mistaken) hit veteran long before anyone else, but my character was farther along than either character in the other pair.  We did lots of setting things up to explode, but their plots never got to the exploding stage before the game folded.  So, teaching that skill is something I'm going to have to work on, but it was not intimidating learning it in the setting I did.<br/><br/>It also taught me that it's important to keep the game (whatever you're playing) moving.  I grossly dislike spending an hour (real-time) planning out what to do next.  Just do it and see what happens!  It's much more fun all around (unless you're a player that likes strategising).<br/><br/>--Nancy                        </div>

Sorry Shreyas, just to clarify: It sounds like you're saying here that you've had no functional trad experience at all. Am I groking you? I'm assuming that means that all of your experience was dysfunctional. Would you say you have a lot of this experience or only a little? Clue me in on your gaming CV.

By friction, I didn't mean only conflict, I meant also, does it make you feel more distance from the discussion? <br/><br/>I anticipated that you'd talk "calibrating fit opposition" in a tactical mode, and I'm with you there. I unintentionally provided no challenge at all in Brand's first fighty conflict in Unbreakable, and then almost killed him in the second. <br/><br/>Can thematic or emotional opposition also be calibrated?                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: crowyhead</cite>my first ever real gaming experience was with a "hippy" game, TSOY,</blockquote>
Very cool. Are any of the people in your group on SG? I totally want to ask you questions that would help me understand what differences as a player you have, but since you don't have a history in the trad sphere, it's hard to think of them. It would be interesting to see what unusual (and no doubt fascinating) experiences you've given your group as a result of playing without having been "taught" to play in a different kind of world. That's one of the things I'm after in this post, is to see if people without trad GM experience take to hippy GMing more easily or confidently or better than someone with a history somewhere else.<br/><br/>At any rate, welcome to the hippy world of indie gaming. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Do you feel as though your lack of experience with gaming in general, and trad gaming in specific separates you from the people you play with? Does it make it harder to relate, to participate, to contribute?<br/><br/>Also, do the hippy games you play support your ability to play "fresh"?<br/><br/>Re: Your upcoming Mountain Witch game. Please keep us posted! There are lots of ways in which a first time GM is the true test of a game. Let me know, if you don't mind how well it supported your endeavors. I'm sure Tim would be interesting to find out too.

Excellent insight. Let us know if you discover anything new, or if you confirm this after you've forged in to the game. As somebody who gets nervous to run, I'm rooting for you in your first game!                        </div>

Brand, was it from <a href="http://bankuei.blogspot.com/2006/02/conflict-web.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>?<br/><br/>For you aspiring GM's, Chris's blog at the link above, especially chronologically around the time of the link is a really good resource for stuff like scene framing, relationship maps, etc. I'd recommend you have a look.                        </div>

As far as I know, no one else from my group is here (are you, guys?), although I know my GM posts occasionally on The Forge.<br/><br/>In terms of differences between myself and the more experienced gamers, I get the impression that I've taken more easily to the idea that it's not always necessary to force a mechanical win in a conflict -- that it's sometimes more interesting to lose, rather than throw in those extra pool points or whatever (basically, to do the equivalent of "giving" in DitV).<br/><br/>Interestingly, I think I've been much more successful overall in working my Keys than anyone else in the group, as well.  Other people have started to catch up, but for a long time it seemed like I hit my Keys much more often.  I think some of this was just that I managed to pick some good Keys for my character and the situation, but I think I also just took more easily to the idea that unless you say, "Hey, that hit my Key of Conscience," you're not going to be awarded the XP.  I don't know if that's a trad vs. non-trad kind of thing, or just a quirk of my group, though.
<blockquote>Do you feel as though your lack of experience with gaming in general, and trad gaming in specific separates you from the people you play with? Does it make it harder to relate, to participate, to contribute?</blockquote>
Sometimes, although I think that's more my own psychological thing than anything else -- I sometimes feel like I'm not well-versed in.. I don't know... the social cues involved, I guess; it took me a while to mostly stop worrying that I was going to "say something dumb," even though the group of people I game with are some of the nicest folks I know.  I think I second-guess my own instincts kind of a lot when it comes to the game mechanics and the like, as well; I find myself saying, "Can I do this?  Is this allowed?" kind of a lot, especially when it's something that no one else in the game has done thus far.  Experience has taught me that most of the time it's not only allowed, it's supercool, but I still end up feeling uncertain.  <br/><br/>Related to this is my nervousness about running my own game.  If one of the other members of my group hadn't strongly pushed me to go for it, I don't think I would have, because there's this sort of thing where it seems like the GMs are the people who have been gaming FOR EVAR and have a ton of experience with a lot of different games (or, in more trad situations, a ton of experience with one particular game) and in some ways I feel like it's "uppity" for me to be running a game with my lack of experience.  This is something that should be counteracted, though, I think!<br/><br/>It's also a tiny bit odd because the impression I get is that while there are women in our gaming group, it tends to be the guys who GM.  And I don't think any of the guys have done anything to specifically discourage the women from GMing, but when I started talking about running The Mountain Witch, I got a lot of, "Oh, I would love to GM some time, but I get too nervous/I don't know if I could handle the pressure."  So I kind of think that the psychological barriers to GMing are high for everyone, but they're perhaps even higher for women, even in a supportive environment.                        </div>

Very cool. I could see how that would work, as well, the Keys in TSOY.

I was loathe to bring this up, but since you have, I'll happily talk about it. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> There are 11 folks who comprise the majority of my gaming in the last five years or so. Of those, six are men and five are women. Of the six men, five have GM'd games for me, and three of them GM the majority of games that are played. Of the five women, only one has GM'd a game in my time gaming with them, and that one is me, and I have so little experience it's not funny. Even in the Bitches in the Vineyard game we're playing online, which was set up specifically to make statements about what it means to be a woman in a Dog's world, and of which every player in the game is female, the GM is male. In fact, though I've been playing for a long long long time, I've never, ever played in a game with a female GM.<br/><br/>I really, really, want to unpack this, but it's one of those kinds of discussions that I'm not sure I want to have on the interwebs because while I want to explore all the reasons it *might* be the case without actually deciding why it is, it rapidly turns into a different animal of a discussion where people start talking absolutes or get offended, or start putting words in other people's mouths.<br/><br/>Suffice to say that I think there's something there that speaks to negative methods of our enculturation, and I'd really like to find an answer to why it is, because I think that women have just as much potential to kick ass as GMs, and might bring new and different ideas and themes and tones to games they'd run.                        </div>

                            I GMd one campaign of AD&amp;D 1st edition (it was after 2nd edition came out, but our group had no truck with it apart from swiping a couple of the new character classes and some spells).<br/><br/>It was a complete train wreck. Our primary GM had been playing for years, and was a very accomplished illusionist with a knack for engaging plots and mysteries which he shepherded us through expertly. He lent me the DMG and Monster Manual and cut me loose. <br/><br/>I made up some random encounter tables, a map, and a few magic items for loot which were way too powerful for the level of the characters, given how relatively easily they ended up getting them. We were having a try at a campaign where all the PCs were some sort of monster or evil humanoid or something, and starting at first level. At one point they ran away from a skunk.<br/><br/>Fairly early on I realized that I had them fighting a vampire and nobody had a magic weapon. I openly invoked Rule Zero (though I didn't know it as such, of couse) and we ignored the fact that, by the rules, they were doomed.<br/><br/>Later on I had one of the characters, a minotaur, mind-controlled into having sex with a werefox (or whatever they're called, I forget), which crossed an undiscussed line for the group. Everyone was uncomfortable but nobody said anything.<br/><br/>I actually think I would do much better in a hippy game where everyone contributes, there's a lot of explicit flagging and there are systems in place to create an engaging story, which is what I really wanted to do but had no idea where to start. (A bit of a creative agenda clash, there, as most of the rest of the group was about killing monsters and taking their stuff.) Also, I'd be likely to be more ruthless now about giving the characters fit adversity.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to GMing Full Light, Full Steam sometime if my book ever arrives and I can get a group together. Situation Engineering is pure gold.                        </div>

<p>What did Agon do to support you in a way you thought was critical?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>I've said this before, but for the purposes of the thread - the Antagonist has a resource, Strife, that he uses to create all the challenges the players face. Simply keeping an eye on my Strife pool helps me know where I am in the game; I generally pre-create some large challenges in the forms of NPCs or extended conflicts, and then I can sort of fill out the interstices with mid-size and smaller conflicts on the fly. Meanwhile, the remaining Strife pool, and the prepped encounters that I haven't used yet, help me to be able to say 'this is about the middle of this adventure' or 'this is the end' or whatever.</p>
<p>So, that's the pacing element.</p>
<p>The 'fit opposition' thing comes from the way Strife is calculated and how single encounters are constrained, based on the characters' abilities. This means that I know where the ceiling of challenge should be, and from there it's much easier to eyeball medium and small challenges than if I didn't have any reference points at all.</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>Heh. Why not?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Well, part of it is, I don't consider all the skills you're (implicitly) talking about (i.e. the skills I'm explicitly talking about) to be exclusively GM-skills; they are skills that are valuable for anyone playing games. Rather than being comfortable and well-adapted to the 'odd man out' role, I'd rather apply those skills to a power relationship I like better.</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>And not off what you said, but I'm going to add it anyway... do you feel like you have skills as a non-player GM that maybe GM/players might not have? If so, what are they, and do they compliment or conflict with your attempts to play hippy games?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>I suspect you'll have anticipated this answer - I feel like player and GM roles naturally call on the same skills, with different emphasis; as someone who prefers the 'player' role or in ideal conditions the 'epowered player' role, I think I've gotten more practice with skills like "share the spotlight" rather than "manage the spotlight"...</p>
<p>So, maybe this is better for the games I prefer to play; I haven't really (that I remember offhand) come across a hippie game I really wanted to play and said to myself, "I don't have the skills to do this."</p>
<p>Next post....</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>Sorry Shreyas, just to clarify: It sounds like you're saying here that you've had no functional trad experience at all. Am I groking you? I'm assuming that means that all of your experience was dysfunctional. Would you say you have a lot of this experience or only a little? Clue me in on your gaming CV.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Well, hmm... in high school I played a lot of games where I was in a player role and I wasn't having the same kind of fun as everyone else, I think. I remember saying to maybe Judd on gabbly that "I kept trying to bring in strong images by writing them into my character backgrounds, but I got soured on that because no one bothered to <em>use</em> the backgrounds in play." Basically, I didn't have the creative authority I wanted when I was a player.</p>
<p>GMing, I was just...incapable, at the time (this is primarily D&amp;D experience, I also <em>played</em> some White Wolf games but don't remember running any), of setting up strong challenges. I had a really intense unwillingness to castrate the players' authority to do cool things with their characters, which in those systems, and in the light of my cluelessness, translated to not really pushing the characters much. It was very lackluster play.</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>By friction, I didn't mean only conflict, I meant also, does it make you feel more distance from the discussion?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Hm. Not especially. I mean, every so often I have to point out, "You don't need to restrict this discussion to GMed games," and I occasionally come across threads and design approaches I find completely unable to talk about because they are so far from my preferences, but this just reinds me of our diversity. I find more common ground than anything else, and this dissolves any potential feelings of distance.</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>I anticipated that you'd talk "calibrating fit opposition" in a tactical mode, and I'm with you there. I unintentionally provided no challenge at all in Brand's first fighty conflict in Unbreakable, and then almost killed him in the second.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><em>:nod:</em> I chose to talk about tactical opposition because it's easy and familiar, and the technology is well-developed...</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>Can thematic or emotional opposition also be calibrated?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Yeah, I'm sure that it can. I'm not really ready to talk clearly about <em>how</em> yet, but like... intuitively, I think that you can say things like "Yeah, so Qaldun is this devout and honest warrior-priest; it would be more interesting to put him up against a cult eating the inside of his own priesthood, or a nameless doom messing with his seeress friend's brain, than to send him out into the steppes to fight giants." That's kind of what I think of for appropriate opposition in a thematic or emotional sense; we choose opponents that are emotionally relevant to a character, or thematically mirror him, rather than pulling something strange and unrelated out and putting it in front of him.</p>
<p>I feel like that's clear as mud...</p>

<i>What kind of experience do you have in a GM role?</i><br/>I have very little experience. I've Produced one PtA pilot.<br/><br/><i>Do you play hippy games, and if so, do you think that you have had a different experience with them than others because you have not historically been a GM?</i><br/><br/>I don't think I've had a different experience because I haven't been a GM, although sometimes I feel like maybe I'm behind on the learning curve. I don't think that is the case though.<br/><br/><i>Have you played any hippy games where traditional GM responsibilities were shared by all players in lieu of a GM  (E.g. Polaris)? If so, do you feel the game supported you with the new functions you had to fulfill, or do you feel it just assumed you had the skills to do it?</i><br/><br/>I've played a few, namely Capes and City of Birds. Looking back, I remember worrying that I wouldn't have the skills needed, but when push came to shove I didn't feel like I had any problems. I feel like those kinds of game take some of the pressure off in regards to the GM role and that helps a lot.<br/><br/><i>Have you made any attempts to GM any of these new fangled hippy games (that still have GM roles, e.g. Dogs)? If so, do you think that it was more or less daunting than it would have been to attempt a traditional game?</i><br/><br/>I attempted my GMing skills at PtA. I think it was definitely less daunting, although a lukewarm performance has made me nervous about continuing, but I just need to get back up on the horse so to speak.<br/><br/><i>Do you even want to learn to GM?</i><br/>absolutely. Being able to GM will give me more options when organizing groups for indie games.<br/><br/><i>If your first attempts at GMing were in a post-hippy exposure world, do you think that you are (or will be) helped or hindered in your efforts to learn GMing because of your lack of experience in traditional games?</i><br/><br/>I don't think that I will be hindered in my efforts to learn GMing by my lack of experience in traditional games. I think many hippie games actually provide GMing advice that is more helpful and makes more sense to me than what I have seen in traditional games.                        </div>

                            I really didn't hit the issues very well. A lot of the scenes felt like they fell flat or sort of petered out. It was a first time playing PtA for most of us as well, so that didn't help either.<br/><br/>I'm really not sure I've found my strengths yet.<br/><br/>I think the weaknesses I've identified, lie in scene framing and creating thematic opposition.<br/><br/>In terms of things I'm dying to know how to do, I think those two are the big ones. After that game I started poring over everything I could find related to scene framing and relationship maps. There was a thread on aggressive scene framing on here that I was following with great interest.                        </div>

I figured that. I also want to see about anyone else. I tend to think about games without one probably for the same reasons.                        </div>

                            There was a 24 hour period in 1977 where I was a player who had never GMed. And then I ran my first game. Because, essentially, I wanted to play more than anyone else. It was like:<br/>
<br/>
Mike: "Let's play Death Test again!"<br/>
Others: "Cool, but your cousin isn't here. Who'll run the game?"<br/>
<br/>
&lt;Cricket's chirping&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Mike: "Uh, I guess I will, but then maybe somebody else can do it next time. I want to play more, too."<br/>
<br/>
And I've been stuck as GM ever since.<br/>
<br/>
"Owned" the GM role? Well I hope that I've become good at it to some extent after 30 years. But I don't want to have to be the GM. At least not all the time. I've come to accept being GM, and to like it for what it is. But I can't tell you how many times over the years I've lamented the fact that I don't get to play near as much as I'd like. In fact, there have been periods several years long when I haven't gotten to play other than as GM.<br/>
<br/>
My point? Well, I suppose it's true in some way that the designs we come up with as experienced GM/designers can't help but reflect the fact that we've been GMs in some ways. But Universalis was not created so that everyone was forced to be a GM. Despite accurately calling it a "GM-full" game, in that the GM role is distributed, part of the reason I put in my input to have Universalis as it is (in reflection) is because that way I'd never have to be the one guy responsible for all the heavy lifting.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that's food for thought, and not a threadjack.<br/>
<br/>

                            Dave, damn good question!<br><br>What Brand said is true. Every one of the games I'm working on is GMless, and in thinking about my response here, I think there's several reasons why:<br><br>The single biggest reason I wanted to learn to GM was because I wanted Brand to have a chance to actually play games. Since he's come to Toronto, he's been the busiest GM in our play circles, because, well, he's got some mad skillz and a whack of experience and training in it (Yup, I said training. He's got academic backgrounds in literature, cultural studies, composition and rhetoric with an undergrad specialty in mythology. The man might as well have a damn Masters degree in gaming). I didn't think it socially responsible that he, and other GM's (like King Turnip and Mike Holms say, above) didn't get to play where they might have wanted to because they were exceedingly good at creating fun for other people. I mean really, what kind of reward management system is that?<br><br>Now that said, if you've read my blog, you might have heard me talk about how GMing doesn't scratch my gaming itch; it doesn't give me the thing I come to game for <i>in general</i>. However, because when I run games for Brand I am running them for the express purpose of making game fun for *him*, and to more deeply engage with my lesser used secondary story socket, it's OK that it doesn't provide me what I normally look for when I'm coming to play games. <b>However</b> if I could do both at the same time, that would be such a bonus! Slowly, I'm learning to find bits and pieces of my regular kinds of fun via things like "immersive" GMing, and I hope that I can find a better ballance of both via shared responsibility GMless games.<br><br>In general, I think that GMless games provide a more socially egalitarian model for gaming. I think undo pressure  is set up on the concept of the GM, and that that doesn't just harm the GM, but also the social circle around the table. I think that having a single centralized authority for all aspects of the game, even when that authority is wielded functionally and responsibility, fosters a lack of equal personal responsibility of all of the participants in the game. I also know from personal experience (backed up by Kirsten and Dave on this thread) that the role of GM is a daunting one to take on, and I think largely that it has to do with the unreasonable expertise that roleplaying traditionally have expected a GM to have. Ideal GM's are creative, dynamic, adaptable, omniscient, all knowing, all powerful, psychic social magicians and consummate hosts with photographic memories that never have doubts, or  have to look things up or ask for input. How does that become an approachable thing to decide to be, especially when you're in a situation like me, in my middle thirties where all of my GM friends have 20 or so years of experience at the task?<br><br>But beyond that, I think my design decisions are informed as a lifelong, impassioned, <b>full time player </b>as much or more as they are by my me not having been a GM (defined by what I am rather than simply by what I am not, that is), because they are also full of seeds about things like player empowerment, social investment, social cuing and nonverbal mechanisms that want to (though haven't yet managed to do in a way that I am satisfied with) promote strong, (and where possible, impassioned) play.<br><br>(Edited because my typist sucks, and to add to Mike after I crossposted: Yes! It may not be where I was aiming to focus, but I think it's entirely germane.)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            (Firstly, Mo, are you opening this thread to the non-non-GMs, cause I don't want to trample it if it's still "Calling all Non-GMs" and means it.)<br><br>I'm wondering, though, if in your comment there you are talking about <em>GMing a game</em> or <em>becoming the group's GM</em>.  I'm not terribly sure where it came from, but somewhere in gamer culture GM became a role that transcends individual games, and the same guy is expected to run multiple, most, or even all the games that a given group plays.  Which is fucked up.  So how much of the unease at GMing a game is wrapped up with the possibility that you might, perhaps inadvertantly as Mike did, <em>become</em> the GM in some sort of permanent fashion?                        </br></br></div>

                            Josh,<br><br>Well, the thread isn't getting too much traffic, so I'll open it up to you guys. I'd like to keep it focused on a couple of things:
<ul>
<li>Is GM experience a kind of assumed role in the hippy gamer community? Are we daunting to newcomers who lack that experience?</li>
<li>Is there insight to be gained about the community because it attracts GMs in a majority way?</li>
<li>Is there ways in which lack of GMing in trad games might give hippy GM's (or players) an advantage?</li>
<li>What can willing GM's in SG do to support the efforts of the people who have piped up here who have identified help or a desire to learn different GMish techniques (E.g. Scene Framing, Creating Thematic Opposition, etc) Are there people we generally consider experts in these problem areas that might serve as mentors in open threads?</li>
</ul>
We can start discussions here or spin them off if they become something.<br><br/>And to answer your question, I'd say none at all is wrapped up in becoming The GM (who is burdened to run all games), not least because Brand is around. He might absolutely want to play more, but I'd say he's actually incapable of not cooking a game to run for the long term. <br/><br/>Also, I'm GMing for individuals (Brand in Unbreakable, and Dave in a Dogs experiment) but I'm not, and have no real plan to, GM for groups.If I did open it up, most of my game friends would welcome a new GM with open arms, but when push came to shove, I'd lay money on the idea that they'd still want Brand. <br/><br/>I'm not badmouthing myself in this statement. I can see, with growing confidence and skills becoming a really good GM one day, even a great one, if I work at it. I think I have a lot of potential because, well, I've got a lot of training myself in things like lit, and cultural studies, and even an advantage over Brand: a heck of a lot of theatre. But in the end, there's something hardwired in Brand's fantastic ability to synthesize ideas and work off the cuff (that may well be a *product* of his GM experience) that I don't know if I could approximate, and well, because he's got a <b>25 year</b> head start.                        </br></br></br></div>

                            I'll cop to one reason why I have GM'd so much, that I think may also be a reason why so many habitual GMs are in the Axis of Hippiedom.<br/><br/>When you're the only one in your circle of gamers with a strong vision of play, you end up GM-ing because that's the role with the authority to pursue your vision. I have certainly spent a lot of time being the only person in my gaming circle who was really motivated to do anything beyond beer-n-pretzels gaming, and if you want to do that, you end up in the GM role by default under the social assumptions that "trad gaming" usually seems to hold. Ron was just talking about this stuff recently at The Forge - how the social, creative, rules-mastery, and other assorted neccessaries of play all get lumped together in a congealed mass called "GM."<br/><br/>I actually don't like a lot of the traditional GM responsibilities - I'm much too introverted. But if I want to play that whacked-out <i>Firefly</i>-meets-<i>Transhuman Space</i> game, I end up the GM, because I have to recruit a group... and we all know that the guy who recruits is the GM, right?                        </div>

                            I don't think it's so much to do with game texts or anything, though. I think it's a binding-energy thing. Because being GM (typically) is much more demanding of time, organization, and the like than other roles (where you can "just show up and play", supposedly), it selects for people who are sufficiently motivated to deal with that. That might be because they're naturally good at it, or enjoy the social strokes that come from doing it, or whatever. Or, as in my case, it might be because they're the most fired up about the specific fictional content they want to see. People who don't have that bug in their ear, and also don't get their happy from the social role, don't succeed as GMs.<br/><br/>(Boy, Shreyas, that thread went south in a hurry... but yeah, that's basically the phenomenon.)                        </div>

<i>What kind of experience do you have in a GM role?</i><br/><br/>I've run maybe three longish campaigns "successfully" (in the sense that they came to a good stopping point and people seemed to enjoy them), and maybe a handful of one-shots or "failed" campaigns (in the sense that I lost interest in running them and they came to a screeching halt).  Sometimes it was fun for me, sometimes it wasn't.  The ones that ended quickly were the ones that were particularly not-fun for me.<br/><br/><br/><i>Do you play hippy games, and if so, do you think that you have had a different experience with them than others because you have not historically been a GM?</i><br/><br/>Not usually, although our usual GM has had us try out a few of them from time to time, with mixed results.  Judging from the kinds of threads I read here, I feel pretty confident that my experience doesn't match up with the "GM-types," because I'm not a fan of narrative-passing mechanics or things that <i>require</i> me as a player to set up scenes regularly or narrate the outcome of what my character does.  Sometimes I find it stressful (though the advice in another thread here to simply not care about whether a contribution is good or bad and just go with it seems helpful in that regard).  Sometimes I find it's sabotaging a part of the game I think is fun: if I'm interested in seeing what happens next, I don't want to be the guy who has to come up with what happens next, because that just totally misses the point, doesn't it?  <br/><br/><br/><i>Have you played any hippy games where traditional GM responsibilities were shared by all players in lieu of a GM (E.g. Polaris)? If so, do you feel the game supported you with the new functions you had to fulfill, or do you feel it just assumed you had the skills to do it?</i><br/><br/>We tried one in particular, whose name I've unfortunately(?) forgotten, where everyone basically shared GM duties.  You'd have the primary responsibility for some parts of the game world (a concept, or an organization, or whatever), and everyone would trade off setting up a scene and running it.  There were tokens you had to spend to do stuff, or other people would have to pay you if they used your stuff, or...man, seriously, I don't even know what the hell was up with that.  I honestly didn't get how it was supposed to work, and probably never will, and never got a good idea from the ruleset what a typical game was supposed to look and feel like.  It didn't help that I also had absolutely no sense that the game itself was going anywhere, because lord knows I didn't have any direction for it in mind and neither did most of the rest of our group (at least half of whom are even less interested in running something than I am).  <br/><br/>More often, I get the feeling that a hippy game assumes that I'm interested in doing more things as a player than I actually am, or at least that it assumes I want to do them more frequently than I actually do.  Sure, sometimes I want to "take point" on a plotline, or have a particular scene or agenda in mind that I want to go with, but most of the time I don't want that.  Most of the time I want the game to flow smoothly and just stay in my character's head for it without having to also control the world around him.  I <i>like</i> having a GM for a game: I like having someone else handling the descriptions and narrating the resolutions, I like the kind of coherent/consistent plot that comes from having only one chef in the kitchen.  If I can come back there and make a sandwich for myself once in a while without having to take away his poofy white hat or commit to cooking something up every damn night, that's cool, too.<br/><br/><br/><i>Have you made any attempts to GM any of these new fangled hippy games (that still have GM roles, e.g. Dogs)? </i><br/><br/>I haven't.  Probably won't, though it's not out of any particular distaste for the new-fangled hippy games, it's just that I don't want to to GM anything.  Also, the more "out there" a hippy game gets and the closer towards the "no GM, everyone shares the narration" end of things it strays, the less likely it is that the other people in my gaming group will enjoy it, and at that point it really doesn't matter whether I like it or not or whether I'm actually in the rare mood to really dig into a game like that: the game isn't going to work because we'll have two or three people playing in it who are hating and resenting it.<br/><br/><br/><i>Do you even want to learn to GM?</i><br/><br/>Honestly, I could probably go to my grave without ever running a game again and never feel like I missed out on anything.  It's a lot of stress to run a game, and it means doing a lot of things that I don't think are as much fun as playing in someone else's game.  Every time I've run something, it's been because no one else wanted to and everyone settled on staring at me until I agreed to do it.  When a game has worked, it's been because through some kind of lightning-in-a-bottle situation where I actually found myself having fun setting up scenes and deciding what came next.  Most of my GMing attempts didn't work, and it felt like it was because I wasn't having any fun at all, ever.                        </div>

                            What do you feel a player's responsibility is to a gaming group, Accounting-for-Taste?<br/><br/>I've seen your attitude before in some very dear pals, but, Damn!<br/><br/>Do you not see how that can burn out your GM?<br/><br/>I've GMed some games with one or two players where I could take up that Total GM role you were looking for for a short period of time, but long-term? Fuck, those guys wore me out.<br/><br/>Me, I've almost always been the default GM in groups, and that's decidely why I like the shared-GM type games I'm seeing more of these days. AFT's attitude, one I've seen before, gives me frickin' hives.<br/><br/>Maybe if I was payed or something, but not for free.<br/><br/>Being primarily a GM though has effected my thinking about game design in a major, especially regarding "hippy designs":<br/>In practice, frankly I tended to bend, spindle, mutilate, Fiat, and Fudge whenever and where ever I felt like it, mostly as a reaction to having folks with attitudes like AFT's. These uber-lite type rules, ConRes? That's mostly an open version of what I was doing anyway, but with everyone in on it now, instead of just me.<br/><br/>That's why I like it. Illusionism is some serious frickin' work.                        </div>

                            I feel a player's responsibility is to...er...play the game.  You know, get invested in what's going on, follow up on plots, come up with schemes and plans, have conversations, try and do cool things in-character.  <br/><br/>I don't think it's my responsibility to invent/direct the game's main plot: introduce or advocate subplots, maybe, but not handle the big overarching part of the game.  I don't think it's my responsibility to say where a scene is set or what an NPC is thinking or other traditionally-GM activities, except in limited circumstances.  I don't think it's my job to grab the reins away from the GM and tell him what happens next: if I think I've got a nifty idea for what should happen next, I can float it past him and if he likes it, he can run with it.  If he doesn't like it, oh well, too-bad-so-sad.  Next time or next idea or next game maybe I'll suggest something that clicks.  <br/><br/>I get the impression that you equate "I don't want to be a GM or share GM responsibilities" with "I sit there on the couch like a lump and respond monosyllabically and unenthusiastically to anything the poor GM says, and also flog him when he refuses to dance like a monkey," which is not the case.  I like to be an enthusiastic and committed player, and I like to think that the stuff I do in-character drives the game forward and makes the experience cool and fun for everyone in the group.  I assume (whether rightly or wrongly) that the guy who typically GMs in our group adjusts where the game is heading based on what my character succeeds or fails at, so it's not like I have zero input on what's going on: I just don't directly control it, whereas the GM does.  <br/><br/>Honestly, what it comes down to is that I really just don't want to share GM responsibilities any more than I want to be a solo GM.  I simply don't want to run a game.  I don't want to be the guy in the captain's chair calling all the shots, because I find that as tiring as you seem to, and probably enjoy it even less.  I'm also not much of a fan of taking on 1/4 or 1/3 of the traditional GM role, because that's still 1/4 or 1/3 too much GMing for me to have fun.  Maybe it's the division between "I can make a suggestion to the GM about adding this" and "Everyone is staring at me because it's my turn to add something" that squicks me, some kind of horrifying amalgam of stage fright and reluctance to be in charge of things.  Maybe it's just that when push comes to shove, I like being able to focus in on one character and play within those boundaries more than I like being the nearly-omniscient director who controls multiple characters and the world around them.  Probably it's both of those things and some other stuff I don't care enough to sit down and enumerate: the upshot is that I've found that I have a lot of fun in a more traditional game, and less fun in a shared-narrative game.  And I'm going to try to go where the most fun is.                        </div>

                            I think it does point to a gap in design of rpgs. There is clearly room for more Participationist beer'n'pretzels type games. There do seem to be a number of players who are pretty content with a strong GM set up. I don't find that, in and of itself, bad. What I find bad is an overload of work on the GM's part for those kinds of games.<br/><br/>Somewhere, there needs to be some give. A GM shouldn't ahve to be doing more work to play than any other participant.                        </div>

<b>What kind of experience do you have in a GM role?<br/></b><br/><br/>I still think I have little experience in a GM role - which means, there is no toolset I can rely on to make a game at least acceptable.<br/><br/><b>Do you play hippy games, and if so, do you think that you have had a different experience with them than others because you have not historically been a GM?<br/></b><br/><br/>Yes I do, and I like some of them for their clarity of intent. If there is a different experience, it may be because there is more explicit information on what to do as a GM (the same is true for players as well). Note that this is not true for all hippy/indie games<br/><br/><br/><b>Have you played any hippy games where traditional GM responsibilities were shared by all players in lieu of a GM (E.g. Polaris)? If so, do you feel the game supported you with the new functions you had to fulfill, or do you feel it just assumed you had the skills to do it?<br/></b><br/><br/>I tried PtA twice - one was a success, the other was awkward. Experience in GM responsibility can be detrimental to a successful PtA game if - during the series pitch phase - noone wants to let go of their idea and sees no way to integrate them into someone else's. We tried Capes twice, but both games fluked - probably because of lack of preparation (and the fact that the game book itself is too hard for me to understand the rules from).<br/><br/><b>Have you made any attempts to GM any of these new fangled hippy games (that still have GM roles, e.g. Dogs)? If so, do you think that it was more or less daunting than it would have been to attempt a traditional game?<br/></b><br/><br/>I was quite successful with Dogs, and had fun with Don't Rest Your Head. Dogs was less daunting because I was confident I had a toolset in the form of the book. Don't Rest Your Head was OK, because I got additional information from actual play reports on the web.<br/><br/><b>Do you even want to learn to GM?<br/></b><br/><br/>Only insofar as it helps me become a more valuable member of a gaming group in any position (player, gm or non-traditional split).                        </div>

<b>What kind of experience do you have in a GM role?</b><br/><br/>Not a lot: several failed attempts at campaigns (Feng Shui and Unknown Armies, mainly), a handfull of oneshots in a purely humorous vein and a half dozen or so successful LARPS, though GMing a LARP isn't much like GMing a tabletop game.<br/><br/><br/><b>Do you play hippy games, and if so, do you think that you have had a different experience with them than others because you have not historically been a GM?</b><br/><br/>As many hippy games as I get the chance to play.  Sometimes I think I don't take full advantage of the hippy-ness of the hippy games, like not narrating things as fully or cooly as I could in a game with some quantity of shared narration rights.  <br/><br/><b>Have you played any hippy games where traditional GM responsibilities were shared by all players in lieu of a GM (E.g. Polaris)? If so, do you feel the game supported you with the new functions you had to fulfill, or do you feel it just assumed you had the skills to do it?</b><br/><br/>The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, The Court of the Empress, another of Neelk's games and probably some other stuff I'm forgetting.  In Munchausen I was showing the game to my normal D&amp;D group, so tried to be as assertive in the game as possible and wound up the most vocal of the group other thant he guy who usually GMs it.  The game seemed to assume the player had the ability top improvise stories on the fly, which came naturally to the GM but seemed less so to the other players (I was fine with that aspect).  The Court of the Empress gives a lot of narrational power to the Courtier role - we were creating nations and details and such all over - while the Empress role only controls scene framing and deaths of characters.  Nonetheless, I was avoided the actual Empress role because it seemed to GM like, and I wasn't sure how to go about playing that role.<br/><br/><b>Have you made any attempts to GM any of these new fangled hippy games (that still have GM roles, e.g. Dogs)? If so, do you think that it was more or less daunting than it would have been to attempt a traditional game?</b><br/><br/>Not yet, though I'm contemplating trying out GMing Dogs.  I think the idea of running Dogs is less daunting than running other games, because it provides a simple system for adventure creation and then you more or less just play out the NPCs.  And those are two of the GM-ish skills I lack, along with actually getting a half dozen people in the same place at the same time.<br/><br/><b>Do you even want to learn to GM?</b><br/><br/>Sometimes yes, sometimes no.  Usually only because it  is the only way I'd get to play some things that I think are cool.  I still haven't found the bit of GMing that people actually think is fun.<br/><br/><br/><br/>I think the experience or lack thereof of the other players may actually have more to do with the game's success than my trad GMing experience.  I think if I run a game for my D&amp;D group, they're likely to sit back passively and expect me to push the game forward as GM, while I expect them to take a proactive stance.                        </div>

This is something I'm seeing bits of here. For those of you who are GM's who enjoy it, what exactly do you enjoy? Assuming you aren't doing it it just because there's no one else available or willing to do it, what is it that gives you fun?                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mo</cite>For those of you who are GM's who enjoy it, what exactly do you enjoy?</blockquote>
This is an interesting question, because my answer has shifted since contact with indie games.  Back in the day, I liked to GM because I had more control over the story/setting/game, or because it was the only way that the game would happen.  I liked to set up surprises in the game, and do so in a fashion that actually did surprise the players without pissing them off.  Plot twists, basically.  Looking back on those days now, I seriously can't find an interpretation of my enjoymjent that doesn't basically boil down to "I liked to fuck with people and GMing gave me a socially acceptable means to do that."<br/><br/>These days, the thing that I enjoy in GMing is seeing the players' creativity.  Seriously, whatever my contributions to the game are, they're strictly second-tier content for me.  I want to see what crazy stuff the players come up with, I want to see the interesting twists the players put into the game mechanics, I want to see how they interpret themes.  The process by which players can take relatively neutral material, invest it with meaning, and turn it into a story is absolutely fascinating.  (Tangent: when I play, I do this too, but I find watching it more fascinating than doing it myself.)  Nowadays, it all boils down to "People are fascinating, and roleplaying gives them a socially acceptable means to display their creativity."                        </div>

                            I spent most of my 'career' as a gamer on the player side of the equation.  The few times I actually ever got round to the other side I, well, was never very satisfied by the results.  I felt like I had no real grasp of how to respond to the players' innovation in a substantive way and would get kind of frustrated (important to note that virtually all these efforts happened in middle or high school and that I am a wickedly introverted person).  I felt I just wasn't 'creative' enough.<br/> <br/>Fast forward to a D&amp;D campaign in the last five years.  The game went through some real spats over gaming agendas and I did my share of negotiating between people involved.  Over the course of those negotiations, I started to get a good sense of what people around me liked and didn't like about different GM styles.  Slowly, slowly, I began to warm up to the idea that I could run something.  Then, I jumped in, taking over that longterm campaign.  And I was very satisfied with myself and the game.  All that said, when I discovered Story Games, I was overjoyed because I saw a clear direction for what I had cobbled together to be carried a little further.  My thinking was very much "wow, if you start getting two or three or four people all doing what I was doing as a GM, then how fun would that be?"  Now, clearly, there are some real flaws in that notion when spread too broadly.<br/> <br/>So what was I doing that made me really get into GM'ing and then get really buzzed about 'hippy' games?<br/> <br/>--attending to the interests of the player, not just beforehand, but during the game, modulating events to adjust to what they were responding to, to what excited them.  More than once, a player would totally invest in an element that was mere color, but once they did, it became a key element, something they could take hold of.  I can keenly remember those occasions where I failed to do this and how it made the game less fun.  This skill is clearly all over hippy games, and something that most non-GM's don't intuitively latch onto.  <br/>--prepping beforehand, imagining and toying with different directions for the sessions, different sorts of characters that might ome into play, and then being perfectly happy to let that all go away when some other element came to the fore.  That pre-game engagement helps a lot to 'tune in' but can become a real hindrance if you take it as the 'truth' about the world.  Some very real failures in the game I did run happened because I decided to run a module--which made to easy for me to just be lazy and take it all at face value, which left me less up to improvisation and response.  This is probably less 'all over' the hippy games, but still implicitly present, and intimately related to the adjusting to your fellow players.  Most mainstream settings with their emphasis on faux history, actually discourage this, encouraging players and GM's to 'stick to the canon.'  First thing I did when I took control of the campaign was to entirely recontextualize the setting so there could be no canon.<br/>--And recontextualizing is a big, valuable GM skill which pays off in hippy games.  Take an action, then think about how that action can be seen in different ways.  This is the beginning, I think, of interesting scene framing.  Don't just show some action, show the value of the action, and let there be room for the scene to 'pan out' so that value becomes something entirely different.  Where an action that looks cruel is actually kind, where secrecy is not evil but careful.<br/> <br/>The funny thing about all these modes of interacting with the players, the game, the setting--I used them as a player but they never got me anywhere because the 'players' weren't given the sort of access to the game required to use them well.  I GM'ed because this was the easiest way to access this fun...to date, still may be, but I still have a fairly shallow pool of properly 'hippy' games, so I am still holding out a lot of hope in that regard;).                        </div>

                            What do I like as a GM? <br/><br/><b>Constant Direct Participation</b>: When I GM I usually end up involved, deeply and directly, in every single scene of the game. I get to play with every player constantly and without interruption. Now, in most of my games these days even the players stay pretty involved in scenes they aren't in, but its indirect and through table-talk and suggestions and the like. As a GM I get to do those and play hard into everything directly and ICly. <br/><br/><b>I am a Cast of Thousands</b>: Related to the above, perhaps, is that as GM I get to play lots and lots of characters. While this does stop me from (usually) getting the directed involvement in a single character that players get to have, it serves my ADD well. I don't have to like any given character or stick with any given thing for any length of time, I can be as many bizzaro folks as I like! <br/><br/><b>Hands Direct On Story</b>: In the old Illusionist days the only way to tell a story is as GM. These days this is no longer so. However, even now there is a degree to which the GM in most GMed games still has the most direct hands-on access to the story. The players get to author their characters, and if I'm being a good GM in my current model those choices determine the plot. But all the choices they're going to face (not the results, just the choice) the ways NPCs not controlled by the results of conflicts, the relationship map itself, and large chunks of tone and theme are still well and fully in my hands as GM. And as I'm Story Socket primary... <br/><br/><b>I Am the All Singing All Dancing Shit of the Universe</b>: I'm an entertainer and storyteller, both by preference and by training. I've taken classes on oral storytelling, as a Mormon I learned in my young life to enjoy speaking in front of crowds, doing stupid talent shows, and putting on plays about how stealing hurts my spirit. As a result I love to do my song and dance for other folks. In negative ways this lead to illusionism, but even in my modern enlightened ways it still makes me happy being GM. I get to sing and dance and do the juggling act with all the player's themes and flags and be the leader (not the boss, this being the big difference) in helping everyone make them fall together just right. This also ties in with the old saw of "I like helping other people have fun" but it isn't just that I like to help them have their fun, its that I get to do so while dancing like a cat on the stairs. <br/><br/><b>Put the Music On and Dream</b>: I love prep. Not the way lots of people describe their prep, with making maps and stats and all of that (though I did used to like that). I love to sit down and think about the PCs and NPCs and their relationships and the whacked out fucked up stuff that could happen. I love to listen to music and dream up bang after bang and situation after situation. (I've even gotten good at not thinking to the "what happens next" part or assuming that even 1/4 of what I dream up is going to make it into the game.) I love thinking about the potential and possibilities of the game and ways to goad it and spur it and ways to make it awesome. <br/><br/>And for one that isn't something I necessarily like like, but that certainly weighs in... <br/><br/><b>Can We Just Fucking Play Please?</b>: In almost any gaming situation where I'm getting together to play and we haven't decided what we're playing yet or whose GMing or what there is a time where we have to sort that shit out. Who is going to GM tends to be a big slow point, and sometimes kills it all together when hesitance or tiredness or whatever keeps anyone from stepping up. So often I just step in. That way that whole thing goes away quickly and we can actually get to playing. <br/><br/>This is probably less bad than it sounds because I'm going to tell you all a shocking truth. I like to play sometimes. If I never get to be a player at all I'll not be fully happy, but I won't be miserable. The bigger worry is that my POV would permanently skew because never getting both sides of the coin doesn't lead to a balanced view. The reason for that is, honestly, I would rather GM than play 90% of the time. I like GMing, I am good at GMing, I take pleasure in GMing. I want to GM in the majority of the games I play. And so the fact that I have to GM in most of the games I play is really an "oh no, don't throw me into the brier patch" issue.  <br/><br/>I do think its worth noting that if you look at some of these things from Ron's excellent recent series of posts about the different types of authority and the difference between authority and leadership, that none of these are inherent to the "GM." If I could be story leader when I'm not GM that may still make me awesomely happy -- but story and aesthetic leadership are still things we tie so tightly to the GM through assumptions (or at least that I do) that the easiest way to get them is to GM. The last point, especially, falls into this category.                        </div>

                            Excellent stuff!<br/><br/>The thing I find interesting in reading these posts back to back is that I read Ian and think the recontextualizing thing is nifty, then I read Brand, and I feel like I have no connection to Put the Music On and Dream. I love thinking about how things relate and how they interrelate, I love *feel8ng* the wave move across my relationship maps, but when it actually comes to the prep of the game, I can't just  Put the Music On and Dream because I can't relax enough to do it.<br/><br/>In recent months, I've found that the best thing working for me is to discuss the story with other people not in the game, Thomas, Dave, Alex and recently Daniel...  people who know the ongoing story (and seem to enjoy listening to it more than I would have guessed possible). Between the update of what just happened and the plan of what I'm about to do, everything becomes clear and crystalized, and a get an improved idea of what's exciting, or stomach churning or whatever. The problem is, since I've come to focus better that way,  I'm even more at a loss when there's nobody around 5to do that with.                        </div>

<i>What kind of experience do you have in a GM role?</i><br/><br/>Not heaps, in my opinion.  Iâ€™ve only run hippy games.  So far kpfs, InSpectres, DitV and Trollbabe.  None of these for more than 7 sessions.<br/><br/><i>Do you play hippy games, and if so, do you think that you have had a different experience with them than others because you have not historically been a GM?</i><br/><br/>Unfortunately, I havenâ€™t had a lot of opportunity to play hippy games as a player.  I got to play HeroQuest, and everything else Iâ€™ve GMed.  Iâ€™ve been a player in traditional games.<br/><br/><i>Have you played any hippy games where traditional GM responsibilities were shared by all players in lieu of a GM (E.g. Polaris)? If so, do you feel the game supported you with the new functions you had to fulfil, or do you feel it just assumed you had the skills to do it?</i><br/><br/>This kind of happens in InSpectres.  I didnâ€™t feel a lack of support.  But I also feel I've got a lot of the skills already, from other hobbies.  I felt the games didn't really support me in playing multiple NPCs in the same scene.  I tended to just get lost in the dialogue of whichever was the most interesting in the moment, without remembering to come back to others who should also have been having an impact.  This is a function that the games didn't support at all.<br/><br/><i>Have you made any attempts to GM any of these new fangled hippy games (that still have GM roles, e.g. Dogs)? If so, do you think that it was more or less daunting than it would have been to attempt a traditional game? </i><br/><br/>Much less daunting in terms of understanding the process of what should happen.  Much more daunting in terms of selling other players on it, and also explaining the rules to other players who automatically assume the rules must be broken and set about fixing them in their heads as soon as they hear them instead of following them.  I've also had players assume that stuff the game was doing was down to my innate wonderfulness, and refuse to believe that good stuff in a game could be due to anything else.<br/><br/><i>Do you even want to learn to GM?</i><br/><br/>I enjoy it sometimes, but I want to be a regular player as well.<br/><br/><i>If your first attempts at GMing were in a post-hippy exposure world, do you think that you are (or will be) helped or hindered in your efforts to learn GMing because of your lack of experience in traditional games?</i><br/><br/>I think that largely depends on the experiences of the other players.  About half the people Iâ€™ve played hippy games with were actively unhelpful because they kept changing the rules without discussing stuff because they automatically assumed that any game rules had to be tweaked in such a fashion.  This makes life difficult.  Hippy games help in the sense that they can often explain the process with less ambiguity, but this is not a hard and fast rule.<br/><br/>Claire                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mo</cite>So Josh, would you rather GM then play then?</blockquote>
Depends on the game -- heavily.  In <em>PTA</em>, my default preference is a Protagonist; in <em>Dogs</em>, I can GM at the drop of a hat (which isn't quite the same thing as prefering it, but it's close).  I still don't feel strong enough in <em>TSOY</em> to GM it, but I'd love to play it some more and eventually I'd like to GM it.  I'm just starting up a <em>Nobilis</em> game with my wife and Judson and some others, and I'm playing, and let me tell you, it makes me more than a little uncomfortable being in such an illusionist-facilitating, rule-zero-is-king game without being the GM.<br/><br/>I don't especially identify "GM" as a role that transcends individual games; each game has a different role in the GM (or HG, or SG, or what-have-you).  Some of those roles I really really like, some I'm just okay with, and others make me uncomfortable (in or out of that role).                        </div>

                            What kind of experience do you have in a GM role?<br/>
<br/>
AD&amp;D a few years long interrelated campaigns<br/>
Champions (3 cities, about 10 players across them all, some of them interrelated with 3 other friends games as well, spanning about 8 or so years real life time)<br/>
Shadowrun 3 players, few years duration<br/>
Cyberpunk same 3 players, intermixed with Shadowrun<br/>
Morrow Project, 1 player, year some, same with Gamma World same person during that time period<br/>
A few on and off things short term<br/>
Some attempts at PBM/PBEM<br/>
I am sure I am missing more than one instance there too<br/>
<br/>
Do you play hippy games, and if so, do you think that you have had a different experience with them than others because you have not historically been a GM?<br/>
<br/>
Just learning about them<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Have you played any hippy games where traditional GM responsibilities were shared by all players in lieu of a GM (E.g. Polaris)? If so, do you feel the game supported you with the new functions you had to fulfill, or do you feel it just assumed you had the skills to do it?<br/>

Mostly I just don't want to be involved in a process where my input and presence is, strictly speaking, optional.  Now, Judson (who is GMing the <em>Nobilis</em> game) mocks me and points out that of course he's going to take players into account and riff off of what we suggest and so on.  And in all truth I trust him to do so.<br/><br/>However, in order to do that, he'll be just slightly twisting the game-as-written which is a thing that I've come to be rather uncomfortable with.  It's like jury-rigging your sky-diving equipment or for a less drastic example, playing volleyball over a net made of a spool of rope run back and forth between two trees.  I'm sure it will be fun, and I'm sure it will work, but I will feel constrained to always keep an eye on the jury-rigged equipment to make sure it's holding up, and consequently I will not be as likely to push and play as hard as I might want.  By contrast, if I'm playing <em>Dogs</em> and playing reasonably by the book,  I can trust the safety net and go all hardcore.                        </div>

                            Josh, <br/><br/>I'm not sure Nobilis is what you're thinking it is, by the rules. In fact, I'm pretty sure its not, and that your hippy/non-hippy split is prejudicing your view. I mean, Nobilis isn't Dogs, but it isn't a rule zero game either. <br/><br/>We can talk about this more when I'm down there though, as it isn't really germane to this thread.                        </div>

                            Very simply, I like the accolades I get as GM (when I do...I think I'm awful much of the time). But largely I see it as being just another player who has to do more prep work, and on whom more stress is placed to be responsible for the game.<br/>
<br/>
When I'm preparing, I'm usually thinking about how I'd like to be done preparing and playing. Or how I'd love it if the game did all the work for me.<br/>
<br/>
I'm a participationist GM.... OK, that's not even close to right. But I want the creative acts of play to be as "stressless" as "just playing my character." Even as GM. And they're usually not.<br/>

                            Brand, note I didn't make any distinction into two categories.  Nobilis is certainly not your standard mainstream RPG and has a lot of innovation and shifted focus in it.  Sure; I am all over all of that.  But the core, and all of the "How to be a Hollyhock God" advice, is all about the GM being the maestro herding cats.  Herding cats to some awesome place, sure, but still quite plainly taking the lead role in taking in player input and weaving things together to be a coherent narrative.                        </div>

<b># What kind of experience do you have in a GM role?</b><br><br>Not a whole lot to be honest.  What I have is mostly GMing my son (who was 11 - 12 at the time) and, on and off, one of his friends in both D&amp;D and Farscape D20.  Past that I've <i>looked</i> at running games and have even done the odd bit of Exalted but that's it.  Thing is I don't enjoy being the GM.  At all.  It feels like work, and unwanted work at that.  I'm definately a player at heart.<br><br><b># Do you play hippy games, and if so, do you think that you have had a different experience with them than others because you have not historically been a GM?</b><br><br>I <i>want</i> to play 'hippy' games (and own a whole bunch) although don't get much in the way of opportunities at the moment due to other life stuff.  Still, there's a decent chance of games happening soon and they should definately be broken out at Conceptions in February.<br/><br/><b># Have you played any hippy games where traditional GM responsibilities were shared by all players in lieu of a GM (E.g. Polaris)? If so, do you feel the game supported you with the new functions you had to fulfill, or do you feel it just assumed you had the skills to do it?</b><br/><br/>I have, in fact, played Polaris, although it was nearly a year ago.  I don't recall whether or not it contained extensive advise on playing someones Mistake but I'm sure that it had some.  I don't know, I didn't feel that it required a skill set much different from that of playing a normal game, just a more hyper-active imagination with a tendancy to think in tragedy!<br/><br/><b># Have you made any attempts to GM any of these new fangled hippy games (that still have GM roles, e.g. Dogs)? If so, do you think that it was more or less daunting than it would have been to attempt a traditional game?</b><br/><br/>No, although I would like to try (and will have to soon to playtest my own game, Anarchy.)<br/><br/><b># Do you even want to learn to GM?</b><br/><br/>Yes and no.  As I've said I don't enjoy GMing.  The thing is that doesn't mean that it's impossible for me to enjoy GMing and I'm wondering if some of the newer 'hippy' games might aid that, with their player empowerment mechanics and dilution of GM responsibilities.  I guess I'll find out when I get more of a chance to play!<br/><br/><b># If your first attempts at GMing were in a post-hippy exposure world, do you think that you are (or will be) helped or hindered in your efforts to learn GMing because of your lack of experience in traditional games?</b><br/><br/>I suspect that the vast majority of any future GMing that I might do will be in the magical, hippy game land and I wouldn't be too surprised if even the small amount of baggage that I picked up with my ill-fortuned initial forays into GMing makes things more difficult.  However I think that will have rather less to do with my prior experience being almost all D&amp;D/D20 and rather more to do with it having been as GM for two, young boys who wanted me to lead them around by their noses and never take an ounce of initiative or follow up on any plot hooks that I dangled in front of them.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            This is old, but it was something I'd been meaning to respond to.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>I'm wondering, though, if in your comment there you are talking about<em>GMing a game</em>or<em>becoming the group's GM</em>. I'm not terribly sure where it came from, but somewhere in gamer culture GM became a role that transcends individual games, and the same guy is expected to run multiple, most, or even all the games that a given group plays. Which is fucked up. So how much of the unease at GMing a game is wrapped up with the possibility that you might, perhaps inadvertantly as Mike did,<em>become</em>the GM in some sort of permanent fashion?</blockquote>
There is this worry, a little bit.  I think it's one of the reasons I'm attracted to games that are specifically meant to be short-term campaigns; I can run Mountain Witch for three sessions, and then someone else has to take a turn at GMing.<br/><br/>What's kind of hilarious is that when I first started to get interested in GMing, I was actually worried that the guy who frequently GMs our games would someone feel like I was intruding on his territory.  Of course, the opposite was the case -- as it turns out, he's feeling pretty overwhelmed with GMing our long-term TSOY campaign at the moment, and jumped at the chance to be a player for once.  But I think there's definitely sometimes this real or imagine territoriality at play; you don't want to be perceived as trying to "steal" someone else's players, especially if you're gaming with the same general group of people most of the time.                        </div>

                            Kirsten, <br/><br/>That's because in the land of .. um... geeks... there can be territory issues around leadership and authority. I've seen it happen even with GMs who didn't want to GM all the time. They wanted to be able to play, but they didn't want anyone else to be a better GM than them, or to be able to have all the influence in the social circle that being the GM had always given them. <br/><br/>So, while it didn't happen in your case (yay!), I don't think your worries were unfounded.                        </div>
