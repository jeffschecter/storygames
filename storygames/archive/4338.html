I think it is an excellent game and it's probably one of my favorites.  It's such a simple game, but if played correctly, it forces great stories and role playing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI tried to think about why I like this game so much.  I'm really not a Western fan and the card mechanic is neat, but I prefer other mechanics over it.  The reason I like it is because the characters aren't good people.  They are almost anti-heroes, but it's more that they just are bad people.  Not villainously bad, just crappy people.  They are ruled by their devils and do horrible things.  And that's ok.  The player isn't being a dick by having his character cuckold the other player's wife, his character is lecherous.  It's very difficult NOT to have sex with the wife.  And that's just cool.  It also makes it cool when they dude resists his devil and gets harmed because of it.  You have to contemplate every action and cooly enough, every action has some kind of consequence.  Usually not a good one, poor characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess the problem I have with most games is that people will take a vice/drawback/whatever like impetuosity and then use it as an excuse to be an ass.  "I stab that guy because he looked at my wife funny".  Usually the result is the rest of the players roll their eyes and the GM just sighs and lets him stab that guy and then the game moves on.  People use them to be funny or bad ass and get away with it without any consequences.  For real...you just STABBED A GUY for looking at your wife.  It's not reasonable and nothing happened because of it.  You just got in a stupid 30 minute fight while you tried to roll enough successes to actually stab the guy (stupid Exalted) and then the game moves on.   But in Dust Devils, you can have the devil "impetuosity" and lose your cool and stab the guy in the face.   However, there is going to be fallout that comes from it and it's probably going to last for a little whitel.  It will me the character's life more difficult than it would have been, even if you had to go against your devil and took some harm because you resisted.  It's just cool.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOk...that's a lot of rambling.  It sounded better when I woke the husband up at 1:00 am to discuss my ideas with him.   Anyways, now on to the idea part of my post.  Like I said somewhere up-post, I've had Dust Devils in my mind for a while.  I also have had a setting in mind and I tried to put it together and I think I managed it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe wild west setting is awesome!  However, it's not my bag at the moment.  I don't really care for the ronin setting and the other settings just didn't grab me.  But you know what setting does?  The 20s.  But not just the 20s, the Roaring 20s.  The upper echelons of societies full of rich heirs/heiresses to fortunes, high powered businessmen, rising starlets and move stars, rich widows and society matrons, etc just call to me.  It's a fascinating world because this is the time right after the Great War and right before the Great Depression.  These people have everything.  There is no day to day struggle for survival; no fight to the top.  These people ARE the top and they already are when the game stops.  That's not what the game or stories would be about.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that doesn't mean these people are happy.  I would imagine there is a growing sense of ennui in this circle of society so their vices and devils come out to play.  They have money and power to wield, instead of guns and knives.  Violence can't be the go to guy to solve problems.  It's not the wild west, but 'polite society'.  If you kill someone, you are going to prison and probably going to be black listed from society.  If you beat someone up, there are going to be lasting repercussions because it's so vulgar.  Not that their isn't any violence and I don't want any fights.  It's just that it's not the norm and it has more of an effect than beating up someone in the old west.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, I could go on and on and on about the setting.  I just think it's cool and interesting.  My inspiration for this is a combination of the Great Gatsby and *cough*The Hills tv show on MTV*cough*.  People like to peek into the lives of the rich and famous and see that they have problems too, just like us normies.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband thinks this is a cool idea for a one-shot demo of the game.  But I dunno...it's just something rolling around my brain right now and I thought I would share it to get input.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97793">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97793/#Comment_97793" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-20T08:24:00+00:00" title="September 20, 2007  8:24AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That would totally work.  <br/><br/>You should check out Hans' <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=24632" rel="nofollow">wedding massacre</a> technique, which I just used to great effect, and is a natural for a roaring 20's setting.

This sounds like a fantastic version of Dust Devils.<br/><br/>Here are some quick off-the-cuff suggestions to make things feel a bit more, um, Jazz Age or something: <br/><br/>1) Change "Devil" to "Vice." It's just a neat name change that feels like better language somehow. The Devils rules remain the same as the book. But, if you do that, don't let people just then go all over "Drinking" or "Drugs" or "Women" and all that kind of actual vice. Keep everyone on task that things like "Anger" or "Impetuousity" are bang on Vices.<br/><br/>2) Here's a suggestion for changing the Scores: <br/><br/>Hand ==&gt; Wealth<br/>Eye ==&gt; Wit<br/>Guts ==&gt; Nerve<br/>Heart ==&gt; Class<br/><br/>Wealth means using financial power and money, wit could be both social and intelligent conversation or know-how. Nerve is sorta like a more social guts -- bravery to confront people or do outrageous things. And, Class is all about social propriety, but also could be used as in Social Class and people from different tiers using their status good and bad.<br/><br/>While these sorta seem like cosmetic changes, in fact they change the game pretty heavily and inform quite significantly what will happen in the game. These would really moves the game away from physical violence like we see in Westerns and more toward social and financial grief like in, say, the Great Gatsby. Actually, that sounds like a hell of a lot of fun.<br/><br/>Holy cow! A Great Gatsby game. I'm blown away. Of course, I've also got to sit with that The Hills reference!

Last night, when I was pestering the husband about it, he said I should change the names of the stats to better reflect the mood/tone that I was going for.  You have captured exactly what I would like to do.  This excites me greatly.    <br/>\n<br/>\nI've worked up some sample characters.  Chris (husband) thinks I should just one shot it with pregens (that gencon wedding massacre game is a great inspiration thing).  This is just a list of the sample characters and their vices:<br/>\n<br/>\nMovie Studio Exec: enabler (likes to manipulate into giving into their vices)<br/>\nStarlet:  power hungry (will do anything to move up the social ladder, ANYTHING)<br/>\nRich Businessman/Studio Backer: alcoholic<br/>\nBusinessman\xe2\u20ac\u2122s wife: infidelity (she can't stop screwing around behind her husbands back)<br/>\nBusinessman\xe2\u20ac\u2122s heiress daughter: corruption (loves to corrupt innocent...er...think Paris Hilton and how she's run through Britney Spears and Lindsey Lohan broken and drugs addicts in her wake)<br/>\nRich Widow: manipulative (loves to manipulate people just for the fun of it, whether it helps or destroys them)<br/>\nCrime Kingpin: wrath (protective of his position as kingpin and takes offense at any slight)<br/>\nChief of Police: greed (easy to bribe)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, that's a lot but I am hoping to have the players chose which character they like and the rest will become NPCs.  I dunno.  I have a relationship map, but it might be cool to allow the players to come up with how everyone is interconnected instead or something.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI keep saying players like I actually have some.

Excellent movie, excellent for Dust Devils.  However, it was set in the 40s.  Also, and most importantly, it was way too violent for what I'm looking for.  It's not that I don't want any violence in my game, it's just not the best way to solve problems/conflicts.  <br/><br/>In LA Confidential, everyone's first reaction to a conflict was to shoot the crap out of people.  Violence was the go to guy.  But, being a cop film, that's perfect for the genre.  Man, the movie really did SCREAM Dust Devils, especially during the last scene of the last major conflict.  I won't say what it is for those who haven't seen the movie, but Chris and I looked at each other and went "ooooh...there's his end, and his redemption...coooooool"<br/><br/>My game would be more focused on the Councilman, DA, richie rich types who don't need to dirty their hands with violence.  They just dirty their hands with sex, blow, money, and power.  <br/><br/>Here are my pregen characters (minus stats) and the relationship map:<br/><br/><b>Businessman</b> - Vice:  alcoholic<br/> <b>Businessman</b> is the husband of <b>Society Wife</b> and father of <b>Heiress</b>.  He is currently financing <b>Studio Exec's</b> latest pictures.  He's also going to the <b>Kingpin</b> to be kept in a steady supply of alcohol.<br/><br/><b>Society Wife</b> - Vice: Sex (adultery/infidelity)<br/><b>Society Wife</b> is the wife of <b>Businessman</b> and mother of <b>Heiress</b>.

I figure I will let players (4 is my ideal number) choose a character that appeals to them and then the others would become my NPCs.  <br/><br/>Some example conflicts/events:  Society Wife starts sleeping with Kingpin behind her friends back.  Heiress introduces Starlet to Opium to try to get her addicted.    Rich Widow creates a public scandal about some other character to try to raise her social status by toppling her competitors.  Kingpin tries to have someone killed or beaten.   Things like that are what is important.  These people have it all, now they are trying to keep what they have and entertain themselves in the process.<br/><br/>Or...something...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98484/#Comment_98484" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-23T19:31:22+00:00" title="September 23, 2007  7:31PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Susie, sounds cool.<br/><br/>I guess all that's left is to give it a play. One thing I'd recommend as a first time GM is:<br/><br/>1) Don't beat yourself up too bad if it's not 100% "throw the horns" awesome. It'll take time.<br/>2) If the players suggest something that catches you off guard and you need a minute to think about the outcome, suggest a 2-4 minute break while you think of consequences.  I do this sometimes in my games.<br/><br/>Good luck!<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>ps: BTW, it was cool finally meeting you and your husband at GenCon at the RPGNet thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ihmcallister" title="ihmcallister"><img alt="ihmcallister" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ihmcallister">ihmcallister</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98524/#Comment_98524" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T04:28:41+00:00" title="September 24, 2007  4:28AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have been looking for an excuse to play Dust Devils and a 1920's adaption would suit me down to a tee.<br/><br/>Look forward to more info on it.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/><br/>Iain                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
