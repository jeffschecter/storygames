Stories teach vicariously.<br/>Games are good at objectification.  Stories are good at empathy.<br/>Games tend to quantize, reduce, and classify.  Stories tend to blur, deepen, and make subtle distinctions.<br/>Games are external - they are about people's actions.  Stories (good ones, anyway) are internal - they are about people's emotions and thoughts."<br/><br/>I read that and was like, hey wait!  But on further reflection, those points ring pretty true to me, even among the poncy edge case games where you roll to overcome your grief or burn your birth certificate as a resolution mechanic.  Is Koster right, or is he full of shit?  One of the things he argues in his book is that there's no compelling need for games to try to emulate stories, and that stories can learn a lot from games perhaps.  But I <i>like </i>vicarious learning, and empathy, and subtlety, and internal emotion and thought.  Are those things to be sought after?  Are we already reaching for them?  Is it a fool's errand?

All of my favorite stories focus on people's actions, leaving their emotions and thoughts implicit and open to interpretation much of the time.  A nicely extreme example of this is the "Saga of Hrafnkl, Priest of Frey."  On the other end of the spectrum, where the author focuses on emotions and thoughts more than action, we have <i>Frankenstein</i> by Mary Shelley.

In a game, it is about what your character is "doing", even if they are actively talking about their feelings and trying to beat their grief and whatnot. These are all things that drive the game forward. However, the game needs a good story (provided by the GM) to give reason to the action. But there's a word for people sitting around and talking about their thoughts and emotions: therapy. There has to be action, but there also has to be story behind the action.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 2 cents anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Oni<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.thirdeyegames.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.thirdeyegames.net</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156901/#Comment_156901" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-16T09:56:16+00:00" title="July 16, 2008  9:56AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that everything important is about action, so I guess I'm the wrong guy to be asking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_156902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156902/#Comment_156902" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-16T09:57:17+00:00" title="July 16, 2008  9:57AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 16, 2008 10:01AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Snyder:  Absolutely.  <i>A Theory of Fun</i> talks a tiny bit about tabletop RPGs, and it's clear that he's not too familiar with them, or in a hurry to get past them to his primary interest, which is obviously digital games.

It's about decision processes.  Something sort of vaguely like Dulse, in that there's a question to be answered in the scenes, except with all the 'characters' as internal personality facets.  Each person plays one aspect like 'paranoia,' or 'love' or 'anger.'  After some wrangling between them, the outcome tells us what particular action the collective protagonist will take in response to a question, but the action happens off-screen after the scene has ended.  The point is simply to watch the different voices in someone's head come to an agreement about what to do -- or to see how one voice suppresses or represses another.  It seems like it would work well to have multiple scenes in sequence, so that the outcome of the last decision has some impact on how the next scene plays out.  I'm thinking about some sort of currency mechanic that brings forth a 'what you resist persists' effect.  I think it <i>could</i> be both captivating and fun, with the right implementation.  I'll have to ponder mechanics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156908/#Comment_156908" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-16T10:18:00+00:00" title="July 16, 2008 10:18AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that the quoted text, when applied to the thing I do, is pure and utter bullshit.

In broad strokes, it is the assertion that a game of Chess does not need to tall a story to be a satisfying game, and that using chess pieces to tell a story will not necessarily make for a fun game. <br><br>Where it gets weird, especially for this crowd, is that we often view the creation of story from a more atomic level. That is to say, we embrace the _actions_ that create stories (creation, plotting, telling, collaborating, whatever) as being on the same level as any other action (moving a piece, making a tactical decision) so that when we create a game with those pieces, it create story.  That's awesome, but from Koster's perspective, that's more of a curiosity of the playing pieces we choose to use.  That some games create story in this fashion is no more surprising (and no more impactful) than the idea that a game about putting together food ingredients might make bread.<br><br>I feel like this is one of those things better expressed with a diagram or some kind of Algebra, but i hope the gist of it is clear.<br><br/>-Rob D.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156913">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156913/#Comment_156913" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-16T10:20:14+00:00" title="July 16, 2008 10:20AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is dividing things into "games" and "stories" a useful division for our purposes (because, in the end, they're just arbitrary categories)?

I'm not attempting to sound provocative, just that what Koster is calling a game isn't really the thing we're all interested in.

We build methods and mediums.<br/><br/>4th Ed, i would say is a game, and follows Koster's rules pretty well. Sure you can tack on more roleplaying scenes and develop story, but that's not really what the rules support, that's not "the game." Look at crossover board games, like Arkham horror, yeah there's story there, but it's not really the thing that makes the play fun; the color does, and the interaction at the table does. <br/><br/>jason- Very cute citing Lady and Otto as your example of a game where no action occurs. For those of you who don't follow the link or are unfamiliar with the game, Lady and Otto is about how gamers bring their own story baggage to games and will fill an otherwise pure experience with the corrupting need for conflict, drama, and plot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156920">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156920/#Comment_156920" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-16T10:33:52+00:00" title="July 16, 2008 10:33AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kevin Allen Jr</cite>Carry: a game about war isn't really a game, for random example, it's a method for telling stories.</blockquote>Can you elaborate on that?

I host bull sessions.  <br><br>In these sessions:<br/><br/>-We jointly collaborate on creating the interesting events surrounding a cluster of people in a made-up world, employing a fairly intuitive division of roles (at least to us), where one person loosely manages some stuff, and other take care of characters.

This may not be quite what you're thinking of, but hopefully, it at least won't be hostile to the thing you're trying to get at.<br/><br/>Treating the fictional world as a collection of playing pieces and objects means that we can get all the kinds of good stuff that regular game-type games provide.   Treating them as expressions to be empathised with can make for story stuff, but it can also lead to session as a weird means of communication - which is why people thinking about this kind of thing often also feel the need to stop and think for a moment about play-as-therapy.<br/><br/>Switching some piece of fiction from one of those kinds of thinking to another can yield interesting moments and enjoyments of other kinds; when your knight (an expression of you in the fictional world) is sitting around and their page (an object sometimes used to facilitate expression) suddenly says something inadvertently poignant as a mouthpiece for a GM, they might make the leap in your head between object and expression, and once you act on that, the transition permeates the group.<br/><br/>Going the other way, you might deliberately "step back" from your character, making them an object in your head, so that you can employ the now-object in a wider expression; when your send the knight to die, you're not expressing yourself through the knight, but with the knight as a tool.<br/><br/>These are just meandering thoughts on that...   Kind of looking at it as a "stance-to-fiction" thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clint%20Krause" title="Clint Krause"><img alt="Clint Krause" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clint%20Krause">Clint Krause</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156969/#Comment_156969" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-16T12:34:53+00:00" title="July 16, 2008 12:34PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 16, 2008 12:38PM by Clint Krause.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is something that I've been thinking about a lot lately.  <br/><br/>I've gradually moved toward designing games that are not about making stories in the the traditional sense.  They don't really support good narrative pacing, arcing fiction, etc . . .  What I've found is that such games <i>do</i> produce stories, or at least drama in some sense.  They produce the same kinds of stories that you get in sports or video games.  Little mini-stories about an interesting series of events within a constrained and regulated framework.  <br/><br/>Think baseball.  It's like the bottom of the 9th grand slam to come from behind and win the game.  There's certainly drama in that, and I think it's some type of story, but it's completely generated by the structure and procedures of the game.  <br/><br/>I got into this mindset a couple of years ago when I learned how to play D&amp;D "correctly" for the first time (I maintain that many, many people get bad impressions about the game because they play it wrong)  .

You can't use stories for vicarious learning until you have enough experience with stories to make them intelligible to yourself. Being a fluent reader or listener of stories takes lots and lots of practice. <br/>\n<br/>\n2. Stories and games are not good at anything. They are however good for many things. What they are good for however depends on the practices of their users, the traditions of their users culture, and the skillfulness of their users.  In the hands of an unskilled user or in a culture where games are not used for objectification nor stories for empathy, we will not see them being used for such purposes.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. I think Raph would have been better served by saying that games explain and stories give us meaning. But does this mean that we cannot find meaning from the games that we play or explanations from stories? I suspect that we can find meaning in games and explanations from stories.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Thoughts and emotions are actions. Furthermore, only some cultures distinguish the external and internal or even hold views on the matter. Even those that do hold this distinction came from those that did not. Yet all these cultures have or had stories and games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_156994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156994/#Comment_156994" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-16T13:42:33+00:00" title="July 16, 2008  1:42PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Coming late to this particular party, but... this right here?\n<blockquote>Games are external - they are about people's actions.

Also, false dichotomy.<br/><br/>To me, a story which is mainly about people's emotions and thoughts, with very little in the way of action, is usually intensely dull unless incredibly well done (sometimes even then) - though <i>the same is also true</i> of a story which is mainly about people's actions with very little about their emotions and thoughts. <br/><br/>The first kind is the stereotypical "literary" story, the second kind the stereotypical "genre" story. "High" culture and "low" culture. <br/><br/>Well, screw that distinction anyway.

However, around the quantified structure of a game (whether is my hit point total or how many times I'm on the owe list), "story" can hang on. <br/><br/>So you can have game and story at once, and arguing about divisions between them again becomes a questionable exercise.<br/><br/>I suggust the premise of the story-games site being about being interested in games were story comes first acknowledges they are not the same thing and not mutually exclusive things.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_157014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157014/#Comment_157014" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-16T15:20:21+00:00" title="July 16, 2008  3:20PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You "you can't define it!

But you're right; we don't have any common ground in this thread to speak about this stuff with any specificity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_157025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157025/#Comment_157025" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-16T16:21:37+00:00" title="July 16, 2008  4:21PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I have no problem with provisional definitions, definitions <i>arguendo</i> and so on, but I think the main issue many have is trying to take these definitions beyond the hothouse where they were carefully raised from tiny sprouts and trying to plant them in frat house gardens and ceramic pots at smoky diners.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_157030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157030/#Comment_157030" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-16T16:59:07+00:00" title="July 16, 2008  4:59PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For Koster's values of "game" and "story", his premises are entirely consistent and (barring some weird edge cases) perfectly accurate. The major thing that makes them a poor fit for the sort of games "story games" is dealing with is pretty clear, too.<br/><br/>In Koster's world, a game is a closed system. It contains all the fictional content and all the "rules" in a fixed, unalterable form when the player encounters it. All the player can do is explore the game as it exists.<br/><br/>In "story games", the game is an <b>open</b> system, a <i>mechanism</i>, if you will, that takes player input and transforms it into new rules and new fictional content. Indeed, a fair number of our games don't even <b>work</b> as Koster games - they are intentionally incomplete systems unless they get user input and rule-making. Even highly exploratory games - things like <i>Spore</i> or <i>Sims</i> - only allow the user to manipulate a defined set of elements. You can do anything you like, as long as it fits into this framework. I think highly System-Matters, coherent TTRPGs come about as close as anything in the tabletop world to a Koster game, but they're still a good distance away.<br/><br/>Similarly, what counts as "story" in our medium and other media are only superficially similar, but we could be here til doomsday if we get into that swamp.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_157038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157038/#Comment_157038" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-16T18:09:23+00:00" title="July 16, 2008  6:09PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What if we remove the terms game and story from the original quote?

Items with Property B teach vicariously.<br/>Items with Property A are good at objectification.  Items with Property B are good at empathy.<br/>Items with Property A tend to quantize, reduce, and classify.  Items with Property B tend to blur, deepen, and make subtle distinctions.<br/>Items with Property A are external - they are about people's actions.  Items with Property B are internal - they are about people's emotions and thoughts.</blockquote>\nThen can we view these as attractors within the possibility space of experiences we could have?  There are some things that have a lot of Property A, there are others that have a lot of Property B, there are some that blend the two.  The closer you are to either pole, the more likely you are to be drawn farther toward it.  Is it better to have one or the other?  Depends on what you like.  Is it necessary for one Property to be more like the other?  I don't see how we can draw that conclusion.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Arpie</cite>And there is the idea to contend with that actions can be external expressions of the internal.  In other words, you can translate what someone is feeling from how they're acting.</blockquote>\nYeah, internal and external are linked in both directions.

Think of it whichever way you like -- the specifics are less relevant than this:<br/><br/>It doesn't necessarily matter what a game is or what a story is, or how we culturally define those terms.  In this particular context, Koster is talking about conglomerations of things that tend to go together.  Whether you call them game/story or A/B or Bob/Fred, you'll still observe phenomena clumping together in some way.  Maybe Koster segments them differently than we would, and so means something different when he says 'game.'  The 'proper' definition can be argued, but I think it misses the important point.  The point, in my mind, is not so much how we label the segments, but whether or not how we've segmented phenomena is useful.  Do experiential teaching and objectification tend to go together?  If so, why has that historically been the case?  Are there exceptions?  How hard would it be to do one without the other?  What about for subtle distinctions and vicarious learning?  And so on.<br/><br/>Does that make any sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
