                    Yesterday I picked up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wario_Ware:_Smooth_Moves" rel="nofollow">Wario Ware: Smooth Moves</a> for the Nintendo Wii (entirely too many gameplay videos <a href="http://www.gametrailers.com/gamepage.php?id=2633" rel="nofollow">here</a>, similar Japanese doujin game with maids <a href="http://www.simulationstyle.com/nemigi.html" rel="nofollow">over here</a>), and between that and <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2173&amp;page=1#Item_11" rel="nofollow">Jonathan's earlier thread</a> and that <a href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/Quiz_and_Dragons_RPG.php" rel="nofollow">Quiz &amp; Dragons 24-hour RPG</a>, I accidentally came up with yet another concept for a game (or possibly several games, or something).<br/><br/>Wario Ware hits you with a succession of "micro-games," teeny-tiny little challenges where sometimes figuring out what you're supposed to do is more challenging that what you have to do (especially with the Wii's motion-sensing controller). In multiplayer, the game uses these micro-games in several different contexts, and sometimes even makes them irrelevant to the main objective. All of this is done with a bizarrely eclectic range of art styles (it has snippets of dozens of Nintendo games, exaggerated 3-D models, what look like little kids' drawings, etc.) and activities (from guiding a finger into Wario's nose to shooting a cannon at a giant robot). I find this really, really neat for some reason.<br/><br/>So this would be a sort of meta-game, where the GM ("Host") has some random props (dice, scrap paper, pencils, an action figure, a rubber ball, etc.) and tosses random challenges at the players (Draw a happy face! Open this soda can! Stack these dice! Catch!) rapid-fire, in place of (or in addition to) any normal and reasonable resolution system.<br/><br/>I want to put together a deck of micro-game cards (including blank cards so you can make up new ones to go with whatever props you might have handy), a simple comedy RPG, and a board game, plus suggestions for dropping the micro-games into all kinds of other tabletop games.<br/><br/>I have to think more about the RPG part, in terms of what kind of mechanics and setting/premise would actually go well with spastic micro-games. The Wario Ware games actually do have characters and stories, even if it's just the afro guy being followed by dancing kitties or the kung fu guy fighting his way to the front of the line at a meat bun stand.                </div>

                            Hmmm. I'd have to see it to believe it, but you won't hear any Nay's from me. Wario Ware is one of the coolest game franchises ever, and seeing it on the table would be pretty darn cool, be it an RPG or even just a "Cranium on crack" boardgame.<br/><br/>Good luck and post your results!<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            We sort of did this at lunch yesterday.  I brought a bag of random dice and we made up a bunch of stupid games on the spot.  The best one involved leprosy, but none of them were tied together or seemed particularly fun outside of their time-killing function.  It would be interesting to see a game that had, say, ten different methods of resolving conflicts, and there was a good reason to change them up built in.                        </div>

This sounds brilliant. Also, it means you could do things like Jenga-based resolution or Plasticene-based resolution. You couldn't design a whole game round them, but for a mini-game, they'd be perfect.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>
