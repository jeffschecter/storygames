<p>So I suspect we're all pretty cool with the idea of the following sequence:  You play a knight.  You want him to climb a high, slick tower.  He tries and fails.  He gets ropes, tries and fails.  Finally he gives up, and goes and does a quest to help people.  Upon this quest he gains a map that shows him the secret path to climb the tower.  He returns and tries to climb up the high, slick tower and succeeds.  Yay!</p>
<p>I also suspect that some folks may not be as comfortable with the idea of the following sequence:  You play a high school student.  You want him to admit his love to a girl in his class.  He tries and fails.  He manages to find time alone with her when some friends are out at a theme park, and fails.  Finally he gives up and goes and helps his friend with other emotional issues.  Doing this he gains insight into his own fears and how they were holding him back.  He returns and tries to admit his feelings to the girl and succeeds.  Yay!</p>
<p>So ... how come this is so difficult?</p>
<p>Is it that it violates our sense that we <em>are</em> the character ... since those internal constraints that stop the character don't exist in us, the player?</p>
<p>Is it that it violates our suspension of disbelief, because while we're willing to give a system the benefit of the doubt about whether a guy can climb a tower, we're sure we <em>know</em> whether a guy can talk to a girl?</p>
<p>Is it because it robs the players of choices, by telling them that they simply cannot have their character do certain things?</p>
<p>Is it because it parcels out authority to narrate in a way with which we are not familiar (specifically <em>not</em> giving one person absolute rights over everything that happens inside their character's skin)?</p>
<p>Or is it something else entirely.  What the hell's going on here, anyway?</p>

Could you detail what is happening in the game systems with both the knight and the high school student.<br/>

                            I have allways maintained that it is easier to suspend disbelief  with something you know little about.<br/><br/>For the same reason it is easier to imagine a friend getting a job they are only vaguely suited for that it is to imagine yourself in the same position. <br/><br/>You can imagine being the guywith the girlfriend a lot more clearly than you can imagine climbing a slick tower; and in imagining itmore clearly, you come up with things that catch on your disbelief.<br/><br/>what might help this is a way of saying to the player that there is already in the guy with the girlfriend some reserve of courage or something that says it's ok to imagine him doing something that we would be scared to.                        </div>

                            I think it's because the map is a thing that the guy can hold in his hand and he can't have it until he goes and gets it over there.  The high school scenario is all about <em>characterization:</em> and the "rational" response is "why does the guy have to go over there to figure that out, why can't he just figure that out himself right there?"  Which isn't that stupid of a question.<br/><br/>It might be helped if you frame the problem and the character as having something that stands in their way and will stand in their way until overcome.  Which I think you're doing.                        </div>

                            Hm.  I've never had a problem with unspoken affection between characters in games.  In fact, I think internal conflict over affection for me has been a terrific and fun aspect of games.  This includes many of my convention games as well as regular campaigns, so I don't think it's a peculiar mix of players.  <br/>
<br/>
Now, there are other internal conflicts which I find much harder.  Conflicts over issues distant from present experience are tough: like pain, or fear of heights and other phobias.  Regardless of whether these are handled as rolling dice or through role-playing, it is difficult to get them to have much impact.                        </div>

                            What Joshua said, pretty much. In the tower example, there's a concrete reason why I succeed or fail (the ropes don't catch, the map works).<br/>
<br/>
Also, there's an embarrassment factor in there. I feel slightly embarrassed playing a character who can't talk to a girl, because I don't want to reveal to everyone else that I'm incompetent at talking to women.<br/>

<p>That is an interesting question. It seems to be easier, or just more often accomplished, to detail the exterior abilities of a character on the character sheet than to do the same for the interior. Putting the character's emotional state, thoughts, and ideas into the play space seems an elegant solution for this problem. Though, then you still have the break: You can't 'be' that character with such gadgetry in place.</p>
<p>I also find I have the exact opposite resonance than you might expect. I would much rather play and would enjoy more the latter conflict than the former. Hmmm.</p>

<p>Interesting!  If there's a consensus about causes here, I'm not seeing it.  So maybe it's a lot of factors, or maybe we're all confused, or both.</p>
<p>Here's some thoughts I've had, looking over things (sorry, folks, individual responses on this many varied opinions is beyond me on a sunday morning):</p>
<ul>
<li>I think there's a distinction between the conflicts people would <em>like</em> to play, and the conflicts that a system (in the LP sense) encourages you to play.  We have more <em>tools</em> for playing out the tower scenario.</li>
<li>For instance, we pretty well know how to set losing stakes for the tower.  If you try and fail it is likely that you will fall (and/or drown).  I, at least, don't know quite as well how to set losing-stakes when you're trying to express yourself.</li>
<li>... uh ... I thought I had more new thoughts.</li>
</ul>
<p>That begs the question, though:  Does anyone have any tools that they've crafted for this purpose?  How did they work out?  What can we abstract (read "steal")  from them?</p>

<i>"Does anyone have any tools that they've crafted for this purpose? How did they work out? What can we abstract (read "steal") from them?"</i><br/><br/>Tools? Well, let's see.<br/><br/>We could use the typical RPG contraption and apply it to this purpose. This is similar to the white board monopoly idea that was kicked around the forge a few years ago where you remove all the pretense of the game being about real estate. Just take the typical RPG mechanics for combat and insteal of making it combabt skill and wound points you have the teenager roll his courage attribute modified by his love trait and roll against his fear stat, which is ablative like hit points and with each attempt it gets lower and lower until he finally overcomes.<br/><br/>Personally, I think this is a ball-crushingly bad idea.<br/><br/>Several years ago now, I was toying with an idea where the characters are members of a rock band. What stymied me was how to represent the defining feature of being in a rock band: the music. I griped about this in an RPG chat room like how I didn't know how to do concerts and someone suggested to just treat it like combat with the players rolling their instrument skill against the audiences entertainment rating or something like that. I didn't like this idea at all for a very simple reason: I can't hear the music. Hence why I've scrapped that idea. Using mechanics to abstractly represent the musical element murders it. You could play the system and roll the dice and keep track of the number, but it won't be anymore interesting than that.<br/><br/>That said, teenage soap opera can be a little easier to represent than music. The big problem I see with the above-mentioned system of courge roll and fear points is that it works in the oppoisite way from how it should. With each attempt, the courage roll "damages" the fear, that is the fear becomes less until he overcomes it. This is exceptionally boring. What is supposed to happen is the with each attempt the fear becomes greater and greater until it becomes so great, the teenager either overcomes it or completely succumbs to it. The stakes need to be raised as things progress or else subsequent actions will appear weak and are consequently less interesting.                        </div>

<p>I was thinking more in terms of tools for addressing some of the questions raised in this thread, about how in-the-skin stuff can be harder for players.</p>
<p>Now if you're in the "fucking morons" camp then this would be seen as "How can you do this perfectly reasonable thing, even though your players are fucking morons?"  For me, it's more like "This is hard, for a variety of reasons ... how can we make it easier?"</p>
<p>But either way, it's a step <em>prior</em> to the question of how to accurately represent teenage angst.  You need tools to prepare the ground so that you can even <em>use</em> the type of tools you've talked about ... tiller before hoe, hoe before pruning shears, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>So, for instance, reward systems that <em>allow</em> either action ("Just tell the girl" vs. "Clutch under pressure") but which strongly punish one and strongly reward the other can do a good job of training people.</p>

                            For teens, Tony, you could get a lot of oomph out of a Pride pool.  Doing <em>anything</em> outside of the social expectations of conformity and mediocrity requires spending points of Pride.  So talking to the girl, yeah, you've got to spend tons of Pride to do it.  That's going to leave you totally demolished, though, so maybe you try and just spend two Pride so you have some left over for later for, you  know, other things.  But that doesn't work.  So you try again and bid out four Pride, and still that doesn't work, and now your Pride is so low that you're in danger of not being able to do anything but attend class, eat lunch, and practice varsity-sport-of-choice.  So that weekend you go skydiving with your crazy grandpa, and since nobody's looking it doesn't require you to spend Pride, and in fact you Learn Something Important that reduces the amount of Pride you need to spend in order to talk to the girl on Monday.                        </div>

in the tower senerio, the obsticles are external to the character. For the teenager, the obsticles are internal. The guy himself is what's keeping him from his goals. I know I have had problems encouraging players to be their characters' own worst enemies like that.                        </div>

<p>I think the only problem I have with the original concept -- teen can't talk to girl -- is that it's described as a whiff.  We've all complained about physical whiffs: a bad roll for the knight climbing the tower means not only that he was unable to achieve his goal, but that he displays complete incompetence. Or the warrior in a fight with goblins, where every failed roll is described not as "the goblin blocked or dodged that one" but as "you swing your sword in a completely random direction because you're a boob".</p>
<p>If a roll determines that you fail and you, the player, describe why you fail, then there's no difference between conflicts outside the skin and inside the skin, the way I see it. I don't think most people would have a problem with that teen drama, if they chose why an attempt to talk to girl failed, or if the GM chooses based on general descriptors the players chose during character creation. ("My character is SHY, so any failed social rolls are because of an inability to bring himself to talking to others.")</p>

<p>Okay ... I just don't get that.</p>
<p>If I'm playing (say) some fresh meat in a US invasion of ... shit ... Ottawa, and the rules tell me that I can't have my character do something heroic, and that in fact I end up wetting myself ... how exactly does that conflict with the idea of my being close to my character?</p>
<p>That sounds a <strong>hell</strong> of a lot more plausible than the idea that I would be a chivalric knight in a kung-fu Middle Ages where the Holy Roman Emporer is oppressing the land with Manchu-Angels (or whatever other perfectly bog-standard type of roleplaying setting you want to imagine).</p>
<p>Would I <em>like</em> to believe that when facing the beaver-heads I would be brave and true, never flinching, always heroic?  Sure.  That'd be nice.  I'd also <em>like</em> to believe that I'd always be alright, and never have one of my balls shot off by sniper fire, but there are plenty of rulesets out there that don't give me the right to enforce <em>that</em>, so why should they enforce the other?  Why am I supposed to have a harder time identifying with the guy who panics under fire than with Lopsided Lou?</p>

                            I had posted this to my LJ<br/><br/>Brian Craig in his novel Zaragoz give an interesting take on the matter:<br/><br/><b><i>When the Caliph lifted his cup again, and drank from it, Orfeo cleared his throat and began. "Orfeo," he said, "had walked beneath the hot sun for many an hour, along the north shore of the river Eboro..."<br/><br/>"You tell the story as if it had happened to another," said the Caliph, uneasily, "although the name which you use is your own. Why do you not say 'I had walked' as any other man would?"<br/><br/>"It is not the proper way to make a story," said Orfeo, gently. "And the feet that a story is true does not mean that it should cease to be a story. When a man says 'I did this' and proceeds to tell you about the bravo whom he bested in a fight, or the fish which he landed from the stream, does he not often lose the truth in self-aggrandizement? If I am to tell you most precisely what happened, then I must look at this man who was myself with a dispassionate eye, to weigh what he did and why as though his lack of heroism and cleverness were neither here nor there. Otherwise, the temptation to remake him in a finer image might prove too strong. I beg you, my lord of Mahabbah and the Twin Seas, to let me do this in the proper way."<br/><br/>"Very well," said the Caliph, though he sounded a fraction unsure. "I will not interrupt again.</i></b><br/><br/>I hope that communicates what I mean.                        </div>

                            Just for the record, my response is not linked to the "closeness to a character" argument. I'm thinking it's mostly a matter of whiffness. Unless everyone agrees up front "in this game, we want to portray our characters as people struggling against themselves", people are going to object to such a struggle being forced upon them. I'm not saying anything more than that.<br/>
<br/>
However, I suppose I should add that, in non-force situations, some people are just not going to be interested in all kinds of conflict. I wouldn't play a teen struggling to talk to a girl in serious games, but I'd do it in a comedy. I'm just not interested in teen drama.                        </div>

                            "Just for the record, my response is not linked to the "closeness to a character" argument. I'm thinking it's mostly a matter of whiffness." Unless everyone agrees up front "in this game, we want to portray our characters as people struggling against themselves", people are going to object to such a struggle being forced upon them. I'm not saying anything more than that.<br/>
<br/>
*nods* I see. I just happen to think the closeness to the character explains some of the why behind that. If you have a guy and go--<br/>
<br/>
GM: "In this game, you're playing a teenager"<br/>
Player: "Alright."<br/>
GM: "And you go up to the girl of your dreams to tell her how you feel but you chicken out."<br/>
Player: "What? No way. I wouldn't do that." *<br/>
<br/>
But if there's a bit of distance there, then you could have this--<br/>
<br/>
GM: "In this game, the character you're dealing with is a teenager"<br/>
Player: "Alright. Hey, how about I have him fall in love with some chick but he just can't bring himself to say so" **<br/>
<br/>
Now, this may not be 100% reliable but it does seem reasonable to me that it might free up some possibilities during play and might reduce some of the my guy or turtle play tactics. <br/>
<br/>
* Leaving aside that this example used GM fiat as that's not the issue here.<br/>
<br/>
** Again, leaving aside that this example shows planning before play rather than during the actual play session                        </div>

                            Hmm, Jack, I can't really separate what you're trying to say from the GM fiat issue.  In the second example, it seems like the player is really interested in exploring romantic shyness, while in the first example, the GM is trying to tell the player that he's interested in romantic shyness, like it or not. <br/><br/>Do you think that you can give me a better example?  Because it seems to me that you're using "distance" to mean "able to find interesting things in failure," but I don't think that has much to do with the degree of personal investment in the character.  I, at least, love my characters most when they're failing in really exciting ways.  (Boring failure, on the other hand, is much less fun.)<br/><br/>I actually think that the "how" of emotional failure is key to whether players are willing to accept it.  I know that I would feel very differently about the following two examples:<br/><br/>Player: So, I sit down next to her and say, "Hey, I like you."  (Much abstracted, okay?  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>)<br/>GM: You stammer and blush.  The words just won't come out, and she's looking at you like you're nuts.<br/><br/>Player: So, I sit down next to her and say, "Hey, I like you."<br/>GM: Actually, you can't do that.  You're too shy to tell her that.<br/><br/>In the former example, I feel that I, as the player, have a choice of how to react to my inability.  I can choose how I feel about it, where it's coming from, etc.  I have a variety of interesting ways to react to the problem.  In the latter case, I'm being told exactly how I feel about things.  My behavior is being constrained in much less interesting ways.  I don't mind emotional conflicts for my character that are introduced by other players or the GM, but they have to be introduced as conflicts - not as fiat about how I'm going to play back to it.<br/><br/>Consider the comparable examples with the tower:<br/><br/>Player: So, I try to climb the tower.  Check out my cool rope!<br/>GM: Sure, but your rope breaks.  What next?<br/><br/>Player: So, I try to climb the tower.  Check out my cool rope!<br/>GM: You're too afraid to try to climb the tower.  What next?<br/><br/>One empowers the player to respond, the other constrains their possible responses, not just on the scale of "What next?" but possibly in the long term of the game.<br/><br/>So, uh, going back to Tony's original list - I think it's a little bit of <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, but mostly <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> with a smattering of <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a>. <br/><br/>There may be other stuff going on here as well.  I think I need to wander off and ponder.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

<p>Jess:  I think that's a real solid point.  How failure is narrated can have a huge effect on how the players feel about it.</p>
<p>I remember a thread, way back when, talking about a Conan-type rolling to fail to hit a sickly wizard.  You could either describe it as "The wizard is good enough to block your blows" which makes Conan a wimp, or you can describe it as "The wizard is fleeing for dear life!  He opens a secret passage and tumbles through, the axe missing his neck my a hairs-breadth as he makes his cowardly escape," which makes Conan an absolute ass-kicker who missed.</p>
<p>What do you think about the option of handing that opportunity for narration back to the player?  Like so ...</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>Player:  I sit down with her and say "I like you."<br/>
  GM:  And you're trying to achieve?<br/>
  Player:  I want to change her reward scheme so that she gets +1 Victory dice when my character shows affection.<br/>
  GM:  Okay ... and we roll and ... not going to happen.  He fails.  Why is that?<br/>
  Player:  I try to say it, but I'm too embarrassed.  I stammer and blush, and Biff the hunky quarterback comes by to offer her a ride home in his car.  She takes it, leaving me alone at the bus-stop.<br/>
  GM:  Does she give you a sad glance before she goes, as if she had been hoping you'd say something?<br/>
  Player:  Oh totally!  That's awesome.  Ouch.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>You could, potentially, give different explanations ... perhaps even one that had the character professing his love passionately ... but if you <strong>know</strong> that it's not going to make a lasting difference (because the mechanics have told you so) are you still motivated to do that?  If he confesses his love and it doesn't even make a difference ... <em>ouch</em>.</p>

                            I really like that, because it allows the player to decide exactly what happens AND what it means to the character AND to provide hooks for what it might mean to the future of the game plot.  As a player and GM, I probably would never phrase my stakes in terms of system rather than story - I'd say something like "I want to make her heart beat faster when she thinks of me," and then take care of the mechanical effects outside the scene if and when they came up, but that's a minor detail.  I like the basic outlines of how things are being handed back and forth.  For me, at least, this would totally be fine on the creating-internal-conflicts front: the dice or the GM may decide that there is a conflict, but I get to decide what it is and what it means to me.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

<p>Actually, I'm not at all sure that it is.  The system is a means of communication, of the player and GM agreeing on what is established and what is free to narrate.  If you don't have that communication channel, it makes it harder for the GM to cede narration to the player.  Imagine, for instance, this exchange:</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>Player: I sit down with her and say "I like you."<br/>
  GM: And you're trying to achieve?<br/>
  Player: I want her heart to beat faster when she thinks of me.<br/>
  GM: Okay ... and we roll and ... not going to happen. He fails. Why is that?<br/>
  Player:  Because he's such a calming presence that their deep and abiding love isn't about her heart beating faster ... she feels so comfortable with him that it calms her and gives her peace.<br/>
  GM:  Yeah, y'know what?  No.  That's not a failure.  I'll narrate you a failure, since you clearly can't be trusted to do it right.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>That exchange suffers from a lack of communication between the two people, and therefore from an inability for the player to confidently narrate something that will be satisfying to the GM.</p>
<p>Now you can open the communications channels wider, even without what people think of as "system" (though, of course ... it is ... it's all system) by more clearly defining your results before hand ("Okay, if you win her heart beats faster, if you lose ... what?")</p>
<p>And now, having run off on a tangent, I'm going to bend it back around and make it a side-trip ... hopefully even one of value.  I think that the question of making sure that both sides are satisfied with the outcome is another of the hard things in playing inside the skin.  Some of us (well, some of <em>you</em> ... not me) shy away from carefully considering the <em>impact</em> of failing a conflict inside the skin.</p>
<p>Specifically:  How is the young man who fails to say anything to the girl <em>worse off</em> than he was before the encounter?  I mean ... we all know that he is, right?  That feeling <strong>stings</strong>.  But it's hard to pull it out and think about it.  Is he so hurt that he won't be able to even approach her tomorrow?  Does he give up?  Or is he all the more obsessed with expressing himself, filled with ardor and zeal?  And if the player has a choice of which of these paths he pursues, what are the consequences of one choice over another?</p>
<p>All these things are hard to quantify and agree on, compared to (for instance) "You fell off the tower.  Your ankle is twisted.  So, you still <em>can</em> run, but it's going to hurt like hell and do lasting damage if you do."</p>

                            I see what you're saying, Tony, but the problem you're discussing just wouldn't happen in my group.  Obviously we play quite differently; I only want mechanics (you're right, I don't entirely mean system) to get involved in my game when I have no other choices.  I don't particularly want to get into this whole discussion again, as I think it's been hashed over a number of times on these forums, but I'll just reiterate that I agree with you completely on concept, but would handle the details somewhat differently.<br/><br/>I think your point about impact is a good one, and probably also has to do with the fact that most people are not terribly self-aware.  Even if the player is, the character may not be, and vice versa!  So even if we could describe, quantify and agree on the impact of the emotional damage that's been done, either the player or the character could, plausibly, not even be aware of it.  They're not trying to squirm out of failure - but it's easier to reason about a broken leg than a broken heart.  Legs are mostly the same, but hearts are all different.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            JD: <br/><br/>See my example, above.  The GM can describe this difficulty using <i>external</i> factors (for example, you stammer and blush; someone else comes along before you can get the words out), which helps players make the internal conflict their own.  I don't think that player narration is necessary to deal with this problem!  The question is how you get player investment in the emotional stakes, since if they're going to portray emotion well, they have to make it their own.  (I think this has to do with the fact that the players are actually expressing emotions, while they aren't actually running around or trying to climb towers.)  Personally, I've found that providing players with a concrete situation to react to, rather than fiatting how their character feels and therefore what the character can do, helps create investment in these kinds of emotional conflicts.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            You know, I read the first example and thought fucking railroading GM, I go and get the damn rope - a perfectly reasonable and sane solution to getting up the tower but NO I have to go and do your lame ass quest first. Fucking force abuser! Time for a cock-punching!<br/><br/>But that is, you know, by-the-by.<br/><br/>I believe it is down to what we've agreed to let the system control. In most RPGs <i>who</i> my character is is mine to control, it is only the outcome of his actions that is systemised. In your example, matters are different; I no longer control the who of who my character is. Which is fine, I think, but needs explicit up-front control. Personality mechanics work grand in Pendragon because I've given control whether I can resist that young lasses charms up to my Chaste stat, but the GM who tells you your character can't be chaste 'cos the barmaids got lovely cleavage in D&amp;D is being an ass.                        </div>

<p>By the way, Jess, I find it absolutely fascinating that you view "You stammer and blush" as an <em>external</em> factor inhibiting the character.</p>
<p>I think that places your sense of "inside the skin" actually at some boundary that's drawn substantially within the skin itself.  Does that sound about right?</p>

                            Yes, I think that's true.  Stammer-and-blush is an involuntary reaction, so it makes sense to me that either the GM or the player can invoke it.<br/><br/>I guess I'd draw my personal line as follows: I don't mind if the GM tells me what my character's body does, but the heart and mind?  Those are all mine.  Don't tell me what to think or feel, unless I consent - because the body of my character is all in my imagination, but I am an actual thinking, feeling person and those things belong both to me as a character and me as a player.  <br/><br/>Of course, I'm sure that if I think about this for twenty minutes or so, I'll find at least half a dozen counterexamples . . . .<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            Hey, Jess --<br/>
<br/>
Even if it isn't what you do normally, can you imagine a game where other players can control the heart and mind of your character that would also be fun for you to play?<br/>

                            I can easily imagine a game where other players can suggest things as players - I already do this quite a bit.  ("Hey, wouldn't it be cool if she fell in love with him?"  "Oh yeah!")  But that's very much with-my-consent stuff.<br/><br/>I can also imagine letting other players telling me what my character thinks or feels . . <b>if</b> I then get more control over the concrete situation in which they think or feel that way.  I'd totally be into a game where the currency that you're trading is internal vs. external narrative control - where the more you control how your character feels, the less you get to control the situation they're in, and vice versa.  I have no idea how that would work, but now I kind of want to design that game.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Finally, I can imagine a game in which I don't have "a character" that's mine in the traditional sense . . . but that's kind of breaking the parameters of the question, so I'm not sure it's a useful case.<br/><br/>But right now, I can't really imagine a game in which I would want other players telling me both what situation the character is in <i>and</i> how she reacts to it.  I'm not sure I would feel like I had a whole lot of authorial agency left.  That might be a result of my hardcore-hippie style rather than any inherent problems with that style of game, though.<br/><br/>It's a good question, Ben, and I'm going to keep pondering it.  I'm sure that I already <i>do</i> play games in which other players get to control my character's mental/emotional state, but I just don't see the situation that way.  It may be very much a state-of-player-mind thing.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

<p>I don't know, that sounds suspiciously similar to the rule "creating your own adversity is boring". I suspect you might have actually hit something, there. If you don't control either the situation or the reaction to the situation, what are you controlling? Are you even playing anymore?</p>

                            Well, I think if you're really into mechanics, you could get very into the mechanics behind who gets to control what when, saving up your resources to exert your agency, so there's kind of a meta-control thing going on.  But, like I said, I'm a hardcore hippie and so that's not so much fun for me.<br/><br/>I think that's an insightful comment, though, talysman - and I swear I'd say the same thing even if you weren't agreeing with me.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

<p>On a side-note ... you totally need to make a "Hardcore Hippy Manifesto."</p>
<p>I'm much more attracted to the concept of getting some mechanics inserted underneath the skin than Jess is.  A lot of these answers get less black and white once you have a way that people can actually <em>contest</em> what's happening inside of a character.</p>
<p>Other people have absolute control over my guy?  I agree ... boring.  They make situation and resolution.</p>
<p>I have absolute control over my guy?  Traditional.  To my mind, limited.</p>
<p>Neither of us has control that is <em>absolute</em>?  Well howdy!  That's an awful big unexplored territory that doesn't suffer from the limitations of either of the above.  Instead it suffers from all sorts of other limitations.</p>
