To that end, if I had my theory learning to do over again, I would:<br/><br/>1) start with game design fundamentals (e.g. the <i>Rules of Play</i> textbook), and really nail that down before <br/><br/>2) moving to Forge points about social contract and informal/non-textual system in RPGs.  <br/><br/>3) Then I'd pick through Forge articles and threads (or maybe Vincent's blog) for the most succinct distillations of RPG resolution options -- IIEE, DFK, ITM/ATE.  <br/><br/>At that point, I'd probably be more ready to make playable games than I am now.<br/><br/>I suspect that if you can make a game that has a clear aim and achieves that aim via feedback and rewards, and doesn't have extraneous stuff tacked on, you will automatically avoid CA incoherence/clash.

These are essential, since the perception of probability is at least as important as actual probability.  <br/><br/>3) Models of play - specifically from anthropology and some of the things in Koster's <a href="http://www.theoryoffun.com/" rel="nofollow">Theory of Fun</a>. I really wish he had published his book on this when I was talking this stuff up back in 2002 on the Forge.  Generally here you need to understand things like challenge, boredom, engagement, and different ways to approach "fun".<br/><br/>4) Evolutionary linguistics with some information and communications theory, also Hermeneutics and Derrida's notion of play - as foundations for understanding how systems are transformed by groups of people. Because once you design a game text and realize how people will perceive it when it works ideally, you want to start considering how it will be perceived when it works differently and deciding if that is acceptable or requires adaptation.<br/><br/>5) Ritual theory - I'm thinking in terms of Catherine Bell, specifically. It is essentially impossible to not form something ritual in the context of the RPG play, the purpose of understanding ritual is to encourage this element to further your goals and improve your players' experiences.<br/><br/>6) Small group sociology - I actually need to know much more on this, perhaps it belongs higher on the list.<br/><br/>After this I'd start worrying about RPG theories, when they would be useful (most of my own theories about RPGs stem from steps listed above 3 and 4 in particular, so I won't repeat them). <br/><br/>1) Mo's Socket theory - this is just solid and useful, and easily extended into a language, rather than a taxonomy.<br/><br/>2) the Forge taxonomy of resolution and other mechanical terms - as a description of where design has been this could be handy, but it's important not to be constrained by it, but instead to be aware that taxonomies are made to be broken. <br/><br/>3) Other theories as opportunity presents, especially theories that focus on particularly problematic parts of RPGs, since there are far too few of these. <br/><br/>As for the rest of the Forge theory, I do wish I had read up on the evolution of Freudian psychoanalysis before I joined in the discussions at the Forge, it would have made so many things make more sense at the time. As it is, I recommend it as a pre-requisite for the bulk of Forge theory.<br/><br/>   - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309647/#Comment_309647" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-25T21:48:05+00:00" title="January 25, 2011  9:48PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wyrmwood</cite><br/>As for the rest of the Forge theory, I do wish I had read up on the evolution of Freudian psychoanalysis before I joined in the discussions at the Forge, it would have made so many things make more sense at the time.

In general, high school English teachers are ready to rip into you for any logical or grammatical fallacy in an essay. And they may even provide some solid guidance in short story writing. But when it comes to poetry, it's just "Write something that shows you tried, and I'll give you an A. Or maybe a B+ if it's pretty awful but at least has plenty of words. Basically if you don't cheat and copy something you got from the Internet, you'll get a good grade."<br/><br/>After I had developed interest in the medium, I had the pleasure of taking a nice, formal college class where we learned to make use of basic poetry structures. We wrote blank verse. We wrote sonnets. And we didn't get away with just getting close - we had to demonstrate a control of the rhythmic structure of the words, or we didn't pass. One of the girls in the class, in particular, had a really hard time with it - she just couldn't hear it.<br/><br/>It was great having a solid, formal, structured class that really drilled us on the basics of the medium.<br/><br/>But I was only interested in learning all that stuff because I was already interested in reading and writing poetry. I was already making stuff. And I was already using some haphazardly gathered knowledge of terms.<br/><br/>But if you had thrown Turco's New Book of Forms at me back in high school and had me start with tons of theory and formal structure, I would have been totally turned off.<br/><br/>I think the ass backwards approach to theory actually makes a lot of sense, especially in creative endeavors. <br/><br/>Get interested in creating. <br/>Then get interested in creating better. <br/>Then seek out theory to inform your attempts to improve.<br/>Then, create better.<br/>(Then, perhaps, decide the theory is insufficient and write your own.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309913">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309913/#Comment_309913" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-27T11:34:49+00:00" title="January 27, 2011 11:34AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want to hear more about the Freudian thing, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309915/#Comment_309915" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-27T11:43:53+00:00" title="January 27, 2011 11:43AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 27, 2011 11:48AM by Paul_T.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, hey:<br/><br/>Why does the <i>order</i> in which you learn the theory matter?<br/><br/>[Edit: Honest question, here, not rhetorical.

The evolution of Freud's work has quite a few surprising parallels with Forge theory, which means that rather than piecing together the largely compiled process of evolution, you can map Forge ideas to their related stage in the evolutions of Freud's ideas. I particularly wish I had known this years ago, because being able to predict some of the evolutionary steps from, say, 2004-2006 would have made my interactions with the Forge much less frustrating - back when I was trying to point out what Koster does in Theory of Fun.<br/><br/>In retrospect I would have liked to have realized that my interest was in the analogue of cognitive science for RPGs, not the analogue of psychoanalysis - and I wouldn't have wasted my time and social capital on trying to make the Forge theory better suited to my goals.<br/><br/><br/>David,<br/><br/>I generally focused on what Mo was writing on <a href="http://www.spaceanddeath.com/sin_aesthetics/" rel="nofollow">her blog</a>, and treating most of those pieces as components of socket theory. <br/><br/>The classic on human uncertainty estimation heuristics is Kahneman, Slovic, and Tversky's book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Judgment-under-Uncertainty-Heuristics-Biases/dp/0521284147" rel="nofollow">Judgment under Uncertainty</a> I'm told some of Kahneman and Tversky's other books are less scientifically dense and more accessible to the lay reader.<br/><br/>   - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
