To ground the concept a little bit, I'll outline a setting first, but the idea is actually a broader one of mechanical bargains hard wired into storytelling. Imagine a game where powerful supernatural entities are constantly vying for power. These could be nature spirits, gods, demons, ghosts, fae or what have you.<br/><br/>In this game, player characters are not fairly matched with these over-beings, but mortals have things the spirits want. All the various spirits want allegiance, favors, boons, prayers or at the very least weird abstractions like memories or the color from your hair. Stuff like that.<br/><br/>In exchange, they will grant you boons. As you interact with more of these spirits, or the same ones over and over, you develop certain allegiances, and gain new abilities based solely on your bargains. In this way, RP scenes greatly effect your character's career both in terms of what adventures he goes on, but also what his abilities are. Thus, characters can gain more power if they're willing to take on more hazardous missions, or conform to the over-being's will. A question arises of what the character is actually willing to give up in order to achieve his own personal goals. The central tension of the system is derived from a conflict between the PCs and the over-beings' goals, and the act of bargaining. Neither can achieve their goals without the other.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359839/#Comment_359839" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-15T15:03:41+00:00" title="February 15, 2012  3:03PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seems like a cool idea.

Maybe sometimes you'd have to bargain as a group, and sometimes individually? Maybe sometimes just one person in the group would have to give up something for a group-wide boon, and you need to decide amongst yourselves which of you does it. Or maybe something one player promises comes back to haunt the entire group. Sometimes, players might not even know what their teamates gave up, when a bargain is conducted in secret. This also makes you wonder whether your teammates have made a bargain counter to your personal goals, which can sometimes be cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_359842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sliberty" title="Sliberty"><img alt="Sliberty" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sliberty">Sliberty</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359842/#Comment_359842" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-15T15:24:50+00:00" title="February 15, 2012  3:24PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathon - Sorcerer is pretty close theme-wise, but I don't envision a resource or score (a'la humanity) that you can spend or risk, but rather the trade-offs are more specific in-game constructs, things the characters have worked for or want, not just a number on their sheet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359846/#Comment_359846" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-15T16:12:52+00:00" title="February 15, 2012  4:12PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 15, 2012 4:17PM by johnzo.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>In exchange, they will grant you boons.

As the DM, you can write boon powers up on index cards, hand them out like magic items, and attach whatever fictional or mechanical strings you like to them.<br/><br/>Once, Orcus gave our wizard an extremely powerful boon power that did Charisma damage to the PC with every use and changed the character's alignment to Chaotic Evil when CHA was zeroed.  The player took me up on this.  He used the power repeatedly, his character went evil, became an NPC, and he is now part of my villainous choir.  Fun!<br/><br/>Right now, our bard has a boon power, a daily interrupt called "The Great Song" that some friendly aboleths granted to her.  It allows her to declare that the die that is about to be rolled will come up as a 20.  The bard doesn't fully understand the implications of using it, and is thus very wary, but she did bust it out for the first time last week to save the ranger's life. <br/><br/>The fictional consequences of singing the Great Song are not yet evident to the party.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_359882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359882/#Comment_359882" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-15T19:05:34+00:00" title="February 15, 2012  7:05PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sliberty</cite>And as for individuals not caring what their teamates owe, I don't think that's a big deal, as long as the PC who made the trade cares.</blockquote>\nA good question to ask before deciding whether it's a big deal or not is "What does everyone else get to do when one PC is making/renegotiating/paying off their deal?"<br/><br/>If the answer is "They get to watch," then it's probably going to be a big deal if individuals don't care what their teammates owe, especially as group size increases.  In a group of two to three players, sidelining one or two of them might be okay; in a group of six players, turning five of them into an audience is a no-go, especially if they've got zero investment in what the one person in the spotlight is doing.<br/><br/>You might find that you have to ask this question for every single deal getting made in the game, just to keep a player from wandering into a private cul-de-sac where no one else can (or wants to) participate in what they're doing.  Or maybe establish a convention (all deals require three PCs to submit to it, maybe) that will work towards keeping players directly involved in each others' deals.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359946/#Comment_359946" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-16T06:17:10+00:00" title="February 16, 2012  6:17AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 16, 2012 8:25AM by ChristopherWeeks.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the PBP Apocalypse World that I MC, the psychic maelstrom is inhabited (or made out of) several entities that are godlike in some ways and really quite limited in others.  I'd been playing with how they were going to be interacting with the PCs more directly when out of the fiction arose a situation in which a deal could be struck.  The player, the angel who needed to heal someone but was afraid of his <b>healing touch</b> (low weird) acquired this:\n<blockquote>When you are a <b>servant of The Island</b> keep a pool of favor that starts with 1 in it. At the beginning of each session roll+weird. If you get a 10+, add +2favor. If you get a 7-9, add +1. On a 6- you take none this session. You may spend favor any time you attempt to render aid to someone, after you roll. A point of favor turns a 6- into a 7-9 or a 7-9 into a 10+. If The Island gives you direction and you refuse to serve, trying to accomplish anything else is acting under fire. </blockquote>And I've been turning over in my mind what a hack of Apocalypse World would look like with no playbooks and <i>only</i> these kinds of deals.  So it sounds like we are very much on the same page.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_359963">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359963/#Comment_359963" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-16T08:10:07+00:00" title="February 16, 2012  8:10AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played a few games where the upward spiral of power leveling can drag the PC away from player control and I really like the mechanic. It makes the game more interesting as you level up, since each step takes the character away from humanity. Vampire the Masquerade, Dresden Files, there are a lot of games dealing with this concept with some part of their mechanics, which also help convey the concept that power can become a dangerous thing and the pursuit of it without control, only can end taking away what you care the most for.<br/><br/>What if each player, in character creation writes down what thing is the most precious for his character? then you could assign a value to that, say 10 points. Now have an scale for boons, that goses up to 10. So, you character can start giving up "small pieces" of whatever is most precious to her in exchange for various boons, or a single one at a higher level. For small things it could mean from tricky things like "Your worst fear" to more explicit ones like "the best memory you shared with your lover". Once the deal is done, characters could only get those things back in the presence of the entity (while losing temporary control of the boon) thus gaining certain control over the character in those moments.<br/><br/>Other things could be sacrificed for boons, like your character losing part of his feelings or hapiness, as her charisma score goes down in exchange for levels of a certain boon...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
