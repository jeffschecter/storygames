That's one way to avoid "always works the same way" science without veering into "is totally random" hand-waving.<br/><br/>I also like the idea that there are magical quantities involved in all this working-in-concert (in this case, runes), and that only magicians can perceive them, and that this perception enables a unique interaction.

It's where that post was written/is hosted. \n<blockquote>This is awesome, Ben.<br/>I especially like the anthropomorphization of magic (everything is a character). This opens up many mechanic possibilities, my first association being Fate fractals.</blockquote>\nFATE was my obvious inspiration here, and the fractal nature is something I feel has loads of potential. My biggest gripe with FATE has been the fluffiness and guesswork in improvising Aspects on-the-fly, and then trying to relate those to other characters in a way that felt meaningful, and wasn't just "Oh now you have another Aspect". <br/><br/>I feel that with some highly relatable and consistent stats like Nature, Heart, and Passion, it feels a lot quicker and more intuitive to be able to say "Oh the Ghost Reaver dagger is clearly Elusion, Harm, and Hate", and "This staff, the Herald of Mercy, is obviously all about Allure, Help, and Hope". Or at the very least, after making a few items/locations/etc it should become second nature much quicker than Aspects, at least as far as my experience goes. \n<blockquote>The fact that spells are magician-specific is also cool.

Not to mention the importance of filling out a spell book, and keeping it safe: with this system, a player losing their spell book is literally like their magician losing years of study and practice, because they no longer have any reference to which spells they can reproduce at all!\n<blockquote>I am a little fuzzy on how a magician creates a spell, though.

So every time you roll, you roll ALL your current Sentiments (and all your Desires and one of your Aspects). What this means is that you're stacking the odds in favour of certain colour Runestones, dependent upon your current Sentiment ranks (which change frequently). On top of that, if your environment is working with you (like, say, you're fighting to defend your home), then those composed stats will also add more of certain coloured Runestones to your roll. <br/><br/>What this means in practice, is that casting a given spell may be really easy in one condition, and impossible in another (you may simply not have enough of the right colour Runestones to duplicate it). On a side note, this is actually one of my absolute favourite parts of this system: longer Patterns (which are more powerful) are just inherently much more dependent upon your exact makeup of Nature/Heart/Passion when you cast them, so they are MUCH harder to reproduce. I literally don't have to do any work to arbitrate spell power/progression: it's all baked into the core mechanic!<br/><br/>As for the qualities of those Sentiments (Hate, Fear, Pride, etc), and how they and the environment might impact the fictional qualities of your spell, then that is left entirely to the fiat of the GM/player to your left. I would provide guidelines about the sorts of spells and magical effects that each Aspect/Desire/Sentiment should result in (and mundane effects too), but it needs to be loose and flexible for the fiction so no-one ever thinks "Oh, you had Help as your dominant colour, so you just heal this guy". <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449356">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449356/#Comment_449356" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-09T11:15:56+00:00" title="November  9, 2015 11:15AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very interesting.

So adding 4 Love to 5 Hate gives you 1 Hate. There's no need for cognitive dissonance or anything: that's very scientific. It works because it's magic. You could be a raging barbarian screaming with bloodlust, but if someone hands you the Heart's Eye Sceptre, you're going to have some sudden moving revelations. Or conversely, you could be a cheery carefree Hobbit, and then someone hands you the One Ring...\n<blockquote>What I don't understand is how we decide what magical effects are at all, the first time - I know that the player on the left decides, but based on what?</blockquote>\nI admit it's a bit light in the blog post, and I hope to follow up with some more 'colour' to flesh it out soon. I am wary though of the temptation to apply too much structure or rules to the system. For example, my mind longs to apply systematic interpretations to the Rune symbols themselves, using them as a form of crude language with highly context-dependent meaning, so that you could <i>almost</i> 'read' the gist of a spell from its Pattern if you understood the grammar... but then I'd lose a LOT of flexibility and I'd be betraying one of the core principles I set out to address!<br/><br/>At the very least, I haven't yet elaborated on each of the Aspects/Desires/Sentiments, each of which give context to how they might manifest. The Aspect scopes the sorts of fictional effects, the dominant colour gives the mechanical effect (which stats are affected in which way), and the degrees of success give the magnitude of the effect. With "mundane" actions, the fiction and the effect can (and arguably should) be completely independent, with no clear in-fiction explanation as to how the two are linked ("the lord works in mysterious ways" and such). But with spells, where the magician actually has insight into such things, then yeah, the manifestation of the spell should be relatable to the composition of its Runes. <br/><br/>So, for a simple example, let's say you need to get through a castle door, but it is heavily barricaded. Impetus is all about direct physical action against other physical characters (objects/people/beings), so you'd use Impetus as your Aspect, and now whatever spell you cast needs to physically impact another physical entity. If you roll mostly red Runes, with the Desire to Help and Sentiment of Love, then the GM/player-to-the-left has enough info to decide that, say, your spell levitates the barricading objects back to their natural positions, unlocks the door, and they swing open gently. They can also choose to consider the other colours for additional flavour, so they might see that your next most common colour is yellow, and you have Fear and Desire Change, so they may interpret that the spell fuses the doors open, ensuring that you can't be locked in. <br/><br/>And just to mix things up, you could have chosen Allure as your Aspect, which is all about influencing others to support you and changing their beliefs to align with your own, so you could roll the exact same Runes, but with Allure as your Aspect, and the spell may turn out to be about convincing those inside to let you in and give you safe passage.  <br/><br/>Basically, I want to give guidelines for interpreting the Runes, so that players/GMs can adapt these to whatever setting they are running. So right now, my thoughts are to provide two separate sets of examples, one for low-magic, and one for high-magic, giving dozens of examples running the gamut of Pattern length (longer Patterns ~= stronger and more impressive spells) and how to interpret Rune colours alongside Aspects to manifest intent. <br/><br/>It <i>might</i> help to think of it as kinda like "rolling dice to determine your Ars Magica Techniques", where the probabilities of certain Techniques are tied to your emotional/moral state.

Basically, what the magician wanted, as constrained and modified by the die roll outputs.</blockquote>\nPretty much, provided 'intent' is understood to be the essence of what you're trying to achieve, and not the action/effect itself. Like, "Shoot beams of scorching fire into his eyes" isn't a workable intent in this sense. Whereas "I just want him to fuck off" totally is. \n<blockquote>What the magician can reasonably intend, with any hope of success, depends on what dice they'll be rolling -- chain length dictates extent, and colors somehow influence type. So, I guess, if you want to perform happy healing magic, but all you roll are angry murder dice, then you can't perform your intent? Not sure.</blockquote>\nYou've basically understood it. If you want to help heal someone (like, your intent is "I want to help this person in danger", but you roll all Harm and Hate, then you'd still cast a spell, but it'd probably be along the lines of destroying every immediate threat to that person, rather than providing any direct healing. Your morality (Desires) and current emotions (Sentiments) make up the stuff of magic, so wicked witches can't cast benevolent protection auras and righteous guardians of light can't raise the dead to serve as slaves. <br/><br/>...but of course, through enough suffering even the most shining beacon of hope can be corrupted, and with enough love and compassion, the most hateful crone can see the light and make amends.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449375/#Comment_449375" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-10T04:43:08+00:00" title="November 10, 2015  4:43AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 10, 2015 4:44AM by Paul_T.">edited November 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a very neat view of this whole process: the Aspects being used determine some of the colour (the form the magic will take), and another player decides on the details (how the magic accomplishes your intent).<br/><br/>But all that really matters from your perspective is what you want.<br/><br/>This does lean heavily in the direction of improvised magic being more effective than existing spells (due to its flexibility), but directions to create unreliable or uncertain magic for the interpreting players ("reading the runes", as it were) and bonuses for reusing spells would work against that, so you could create the balance you wish in the game. (Your rules for spell mastery go in this direction, for example.)<br/><br/>I like the idea that the player interpreting the spell is, literally, playing the force of magic: "reading" the runes on the table to decide how the magician's intent takes form.<br/><br/>A couple of things that might warrant addressing:<br/><br/>1. What are the real-life functions of working magic? Is it purely human will turned to magical effect - your desire come to life? Or must certain magical arts be considered? <br/><br/>Are there components to magic-working which are external to the character's will/desire? Material components, gestures, words, and so forth?<br/><br/>It might be nice to include something about the *way* a magician calls forth their magic, perhaps making it personal, like the rest of the system. ("I cast my magic using poetic language, which gives me bonuses to Allure but penalties to Harm. If I try to work magic without using poetic language, I'm much more flexible but also much less powerful.")<br/><br/>2. Everything is a "character". How, then, do the players in this game decide which elements are active in the casting of a spell? <br/><br/>Can I hold a powerful magical sceptre and use its Aspects for my spell? Can I hold it in m hands and cast a spell *without* invoking its Aspects in my magic?<br/><br/>Does the location matter?<br/><br/>Do nearby people matter?<br/><br/>Do the subjects of my spell matter?<br/><br/>All of these questions are potentially bottomless pits: for instance, if location matters, how far does the onion go? Maybe my bedroom helps with Harm spells, because I got into a fight there once. But my house is a place of Love, so that should factor in as well, right? However, the village I live in as governed by Hate... and the country we are in is a place for a lot of Death has taken place, so... this planet is strong in Allure, so do we factor that in, too?<br/><br/>Somehow you have to be able to draw the line between which elements are invoked and which are not. One simple way is to say that the magician can choose which he invokes - "I call upon the Moon and my mother's love to cast this spell!" - but that works against your idea that being in a certain place or holding a certain object affects your magic negatively. (Which is a cool idea!)<br/><br/>I'm not sure what the answer is, but I think one of the key elements would be to base the impact or effect on the overall magical power of the elements involved. "The three most powerful magical 'characters' potentially involved with your spell are what we count."<br/><br/>The peaceful glade is a place of serenity, but its magical power is Low. Carry the Ring of Power into it, and of course we're going to be counting the Ring's effect on your spell, and ignoring the glade altogether. However, when we travel to Mars, the War aspect of the planet is so strong that it effects *every* spell ever cast by anyone on its surface.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449376/#Comment_449376" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-10T06:43:14+00:00" title="November 10, 2015  6:43AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Looks cool!

Personally, I actually really like the idea of a magician, when faced with a situation, saying "Oooh, I've got <i>just the trick for that!</i>"\n<blockquote>1. What are the real-life functions of working magic? Is it purely human will turned to magical effect - your desire come to life? Or must certain magical arts be considered? </blockquote>\nTo be honest, right now, I haven't committed one way or the other. I'm leaning towards a mix, where magic can just be a manifestation of will, but you can really help yourself out by gathering certain reagents, each of which excels in only one or two stats. Like, say, there may be a root which has 5 Preserve, or a lizard whose tail has 5 Expand and 4 Hope. This naturally lends itself to an element of min/maxing when composing multiple reagents together with yourself. <br/><br/>As for rituals and gestures and words and such though? I'm not sure of a way to frame that which would make sense mechanically without feeling forced. I like your suggestion of having a personal *way* of accessing their magic, and elsewhere someone suggested different "schools" with their own beliefs about how it works and what needs to be done to evoke it. <br/><br/>I can certainly just arbitrate that players must choose from a range of such beliefs, whether they be formalised through a school or intuited through experience, such as "I must move my fingers and limbs in specific motions in order to manipulate Patterns". I like the flavour that brings. It might be interesting to tie such things to some sort of backstory choice, like "The first time I did something magical, it was to protect my mother when I was terrified for her life. Now I can easily amplify my Fear to increase my Preserve by screaming and shaking my body."<br/><br/>Hmm. I think you might be on to something interesting. \n<blockquote>2. Everything is a "character". How, then, do the players in this game decide which elements are active in the casting of a spell? </blockquote>\nI'm picturing a bit of a soft limit in terms of diminishing returns with what's available. Bear in mind that composition simply replaces your weaker stats with any stronger ones, with the risk of weakening you with opposing stats. It's not additive. <br/><br/>Something standard might be composition of armour and weapon, with some cases adding someone you've been charged with defending, or a door you're barricading with your body. Most locations won't be significant enough to bother with. \n<blockquote>Can I hold a powerful magical sceptre and use its Aspects for my spell? Can I hold it in m hands and cast a spell *without* invoking its Aspects in my magic?</blockquote>\nYup. \n<blockquote>Does the location matter?</blockquote>\nThey can. Haunted houses, cursed graveyards, hallowed churches, enchanted cottages made of candy... Your relationship matters though. If they are working with you, because your intents align, then you can compose them (though you'd only want to if it would be a net benefit for your roll). Your own house could work with you, but it might be weak in stats.<br/><br/>You don't have to be a magician to compose such things either, of course. But often-times it won't be necessary to bother. At the end of the day, you're just trying to get more than a certain number of success (Chain/Pattern length). You'd only need to draw on every resource at your disposal when attempting to do truly heroic/legendary feats. \n<blockquote>Looks cool!  I'm glad my essay was of use to you. <br/><br/>What sort of settings and adventures were you thinking of using these mechanics for? </blockquote>\nThanks! Your essay was a very succinct summary of many issues I'd felt but hadn't been able to articulate. And it's taken me many years since for my mind to piece together something even vaguely resembling a workable solution. <br/><br/>Right now, the setting which I'm most drawn to exploring with this system is Grimm fairy tales and some of the darker takes on classic fairy tales, and movies like Snow White and the Hunstman, Red Riding Hood, The Brother's Grimm, Hansel and Gretel, Maleficent, and so on (though I'm not claiming these to be good movies in and of themselves by any stretch, except Maleficent). I'm also really inspired by The Witcher game series, particularly in its handling of the lore and the excruciatingly grey morality. <br/><br/>So I'm thinking of a twist on your stereotypical bands of adventurers, as a group of characters in a twisted, fanciful, and unpredictable world, who each have secrets which tie them to many of the mysteries occurring in the world around them, for good or ill. Ostensibly they work together to collect bounties for one side or another, with player characters resolving conflict between their own vested interests for any given bounty, and how such bounties are collected. <br/><br/>The core mechanic directly pushes and pulls at every character's Passions and Heart, so I plan on capitalizing on that through hidden motives and histories (side note: it seems I have a fetish for secret backstories which are revealed through play... all my games so far have explicit mechanics for this... hmm). <br/><br/>And I want players to care about how their decisions are going to impact their character's development, in the sense of changing their Desires and Aspects over time. I might *want* to be some brooding rogue all about Elusion, Harm, and Hate, but dammit, that attractive leader is just so kind and soothing, with all that Allure, Change, and Love... every time she helps me I become a "better" person... argh!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449381/#Comment_449381" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-10T15:04:50+00:00" title="November 10, 2015  3:04PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 10, 2015 3:05PM by Paul_T.">edited November 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lots of interesting ideas.<br/><br/>Two more comments:<br/><br/>1. If, as you imply above, your ability to draw on a certain power source is voluntary (you answered "yes" to my questions, above), then you won't have any of the "unwanted" results you keep referring to in your examples. (Even the brooding rogue becoming a better person.) So this should be given some thought; it's an important question.<br/><br/>2. As far as personal spell-casting, I *absolutely* think that it should draw on personal experiences, history, personality, or something like that. When a person learns how to use magical powers, they undergo some kind of ritual or change (a traumatic experience, a rite of passage, whatever you like) and, in the process, their magic becomes "tied" to a certain way of operating. This makes the magic a little less of a "generic intent-granting roll", which is something I'd say your system is likely in dire need of.<br/><br/>(Just my opinions, of course: you certainly don't *need* to satisfy my personal tastes in your design schema in any way, after all!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449390/#Comment_449390" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-10T19:53:38+00:00" title="November 10, 2015  7:53PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>2.
