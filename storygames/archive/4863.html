I was cajoled into "running" it, since I was the only one who had read the rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur captains:<br/>\n<br/>\nHakim, a rugged optimistic scientist, explorer, and xeno-archeologist, aided by his son and intern Eko, who wants him to get back together with mom, and his hot-shot pilot girlfriend Mao.<br/>\n<br/>\nSong, a spacefaring schismatic monk, with a monastic ship filled with his fellow apostates.  While Song is celibate, not all of his crew are, and his beautiful engineer yearns for his companionship.  Song is also aided by his cousin, a wilderness scout and bodyguard who belongs to one of the tribal sects.<br/>\n<br/>\nNathan, a daredevil risktaking salvage operator, has a second-in-command computer genius Dvorak who thinks he could do a better job running things, and an uptight accountant/bank bond stooge from the Kryos Territory Financial Investment Group.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome thoughts:<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's a lot of information to get through during game setup!  It took us a whole session (although we started late.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's also not much for the gamemaster to do, other than making a faction and some worlds.<br/>\nI understand that the gamemaster gets to decide the nature of the scourge, but that seems to occur mostly away from the table.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd while we're on the scourge, one of the players wanted the faction Song broke away from to be secretly controlled by the scourge.  I said he couldn't declare that, since we don't know if that has the possibility to be even capable of controlling something.  Can he do that?<br/>\n<br/>\nBrendan suggested that each quest should have it's own log sheet- he doesn't want to erase the information under the quest bubble, and there's not a lot of space on the front page of the sheet for all the details.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe character sheet should have a little box for noting what type of edge something is- consider "Fast" as a Talent vs. a Ship Edge, or "Powerful Weapons" as Ship vs. Gear.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far, so good though!  We're looking forward to playing, and I'm getting some fiendish ideas.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109136/#Comment_109136" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-21T08:03:30+00:00" title="November 21, 2007  8:03AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Willow. Thanks for posting your feedback. It's pretty similar to some other feedback I've gotten over at the Ashcan Front. If you haven't stopped by there, you might want to take a look at some of the tweaks and stuff that have been suggested.

I think you could have a fun mod of Galactic where, instead of ship's captains in a mysterious galaxy, you have ship's captains sailing the Spanish Main in search of a mysterious threat to the British Empire.  Or, for that matter, captains of mercenary companies roaming a Swords &amp; Sorcery world in search of an ancient evil that has reawakened, along the lines of the early <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Black Compay </span> novels. <br/><br/>Ah, the pleasures of dinking around with someone else's game! Long story short, you need to play a leader of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">men</span> people who puts those people in harm's way for a greater cause.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
