They are pretty crunchy and traditional, and it's not particularly story-gameish, as you say. There's also a lot of rules, and not all of them really have a point beyond attempting to be granular and realistic.<br/><br/>Personally, I wouldn't run it, and I wouldn't automatically sign up for a game of it, but with the right folks it seems like it could be a lot of fun.<br/><br/>If I could figure out a good way to run it with FATE, I would.<br/><br/>Burning Wheel isn't everyone's cup of tea, but I think it's awesome. Tolkien-inspired character-driven fantasy roleplaying. All the rules are designed to drive the characters to do interesting stuff. A+. Get the Gold Edition or whatever it's called; $25 and all the rules you'll ever need. The Revised books are great; I own them all, but if you're just now getting into it I'd suggest getting the Gold Edition.<br/><br/>If you don't own Fiasco, you should. It's an extremely smart game. It's a good game for people who aren't really "gamers", too.<br/><br/>So out of the three, I recommend you hunt down Fiasco.

One of my favorite things about BW is how it's obviously inspired more by fantasy fiction than fantasy games. So, the elves are like the ones i Lord of the Rings more than they are fighterwizards who live in the woods for some reason. Magic is also the sort of thing where a failed roll can mean summing an elder deity at random, or shooting a homing snowball, instead of whatever you were trying to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and just fighting legions of the Undead would probably not be optimal for the system. If you were thinking of wars between necromantic overlords with the players needing navigate the situation carefully, that'd be more BW's style.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd for the record, it's my favorite game on that list, too. Just reiterating why it may not be that great of a choice in this case, unless you want a really cool and detailed fantasy game that will feature a lot of interpersonal relationships, hard choices, and getting int trouble.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Denys" title="Denys"><img alt="Denys" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j128/iannoble/elf-pic.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Denys">Denys</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342703/#Comment_342703" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-13T21:15:57+00:00" title="September 13, 2011  9:15PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: chrisshorb</cite>So, I was all set to buy Eclipse Phase and Fiasco from IPR, but their website was down.

I've got like $50 I want to spend on games, and I want to spend them on New-Shiny, not on stuff I have already bought before.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's me:<br/>\n<br/>\nI read RPG books for fluff - I have never played Transhuman Space, and probably never will, but I love the idea.  Same with Over the Edge, and I've only played Traveller in one campaign that I had to GM.  So that's my interest in Eclipse Phase.  I probably won't ever play it, but read it for the fluff.  But if the rules are annoying, or too dense, or not to my taste, well then it's a sure thing I *won't* play it.  Maybe I will find a free edition online somewhere - I heard the publisher doesn't mind that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am currently playing 4E, because that is what brought my game group back together - an excitement for a new edition. Personally, I find it only meh, although my GM is really good an gets into it and brings bitchin' props and terrain etc (yeah, terrain in an RPG, who woulda thunk it back when I picked up the Monster Manual in 1977).  Said GM however has indicated he may be moving within the next couple of years (we only play once a month, which I know is pretty infrequent), so I'm thinking of preparing something for when he leaves.  The zombiegeddon idea is more like a horror game, with very shocking beginning, and then hopefully an ending that is fraught with moral choices, and with an investigation in-between.  Something like Se7en, but fantasy on the gritty side.  I'm thinking only 8-10 sessions long.  I simply chose the Pathfinder setting because that Huuuge Pathfinder Gazeteer book and other setting books seem to layout the setting very nicely, without really being rules-dependent.  But I'm certainly not married to that setting.  So I was hoping for a rules set that was not only about fighting, that wasn't very setting dependent, and that really played up the relationships between characters and NPCs.  I was also thinking of doing one of those John Wick things and making the players play NPCs on occasion.  So, my interest in Burning Wheel.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is, due to budget, I can't buy both EP and BW.  But since someone posted that I could find EP online for free, and then check it out to see if I want to buy it, I could save for a hardcopy down the line if I like it.  Problem solved.<br/>\n<br/>\nFiasco is a must buy.  I have a 2nd group of gamers, but not RPG'ers, or even hobby gamers (they like games like Apples to Apples and Quelf).  I'd like to stretch their minds a little, and Fiasco sounds awesome.  I was thinking Penny for My Thoughts, but Fiasco sounds a little more upbeat, maybe Penny can be my 2nd choice once I've broken them in on Fiasco...<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for all your input, I'd love to hear more about Burning Wheel. Should I buy Adventure Burner too after I buy BW Gold?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nChris                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark" title="Captain_Thark"><img alt="Captain_Thark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/674/nQDB5F77NZR8N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark">Captain_Thark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342709/#Comment_342709" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-13T22:13:21+00:00" title="September 13, 2011 10:13PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, yes you should.

Setting is cool, art is gorgeous.<br/>Also, did you know that you can get the Eclipse Phase PDF legitimately online for free? It's Creative Commons, the Eclipse Phase folks seeded torrents themselves. Hunt down the PDF. there's some slight revisions in the rules in the latest print version, but the seeded and legit PDF has all the art and rules pre-revision, and that should give you a solid grasp of the game. If you like it, pay for it! If not, no one loses! [EDIT: oops, you caught that free bit already. Well, there you go!]<br/><br/>So, my recommendation is get that Eclipse Phase PDF, save your transhuman money for three of the greatest transhuman books ever (by Greg Egan, who could build a wall out of his Hard SF trophies):<br/><br/><b>Axiomatic</b> (short story compilation)<br/><b>Diaspora</b> (novel)<br/><b>Luminous </b>(short story compilation)<br/><b>Crystal Nights</b> (short story compilation) is also good, but Axiomatic is pretty much some of the coolest and varied transhuman SF ever.

Basically as player can bring an NPC into the game by making a circles test. This NPC must be related to a characters previous lifepath (A Knight, would know Knights, Pages, Lady's in Waiting). The GM sets the obstacle based on some factors (time, likely hood, station, etc), the test is then made. NOW the test doesn't say if the NPC exist, but the NPC's disposition to the player. If a player fails a roll, maybe the guy he is looking for actually hates me or is working against him...maybe its a trap, and someone noticed the players looking for a dude. It is fantastic, one of my favorite game mechanics ever (as a GM and a player).<br/><br/>Relationships are also very cool. Initially they are bought during character generation for a number of points. The cost of relationship is based off the NPCs importance to the setting/world situation, and can be made cheaper by making the relationship an enemy, a forbidden relationship, family, etc. You can also gain new relationships by circling up the same hombre enough times.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bad_Santa" title="Bad_Santa"><img alt="Bad_Santa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://anvalisok.com/cthulhu.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bad_Santa">Bad_Santa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342730/#Comment_342730" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-14T05:14:59+00:00" title="September 14, 2011  5:14AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 14, 2011 5:16AM by Bad_Santa.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To add to Relationships, Affiliations:<br/><br/>Affiliations are memberships within groups.

I'd like to recommend that you check out <a href="http://www.dungeon-world.com/index.php/buy/" rel="nofollow">Dungeon World</a> (PDF = $5) as a much faster paced alternative.  Burning Wheel would work, but it would be better if you wanted to do, for example, the drama of life in a walled city surrounded by zombies.<br/><br/>[edit] Sorry read the first post and then had thoughts about it later, I think I see what you're shooting for more clearly now.

They're both gritty fantasy, 100%.<br/><br/>Burning Wheel is one of my favorite games OF ALL TIME. It's just excellent if you've never played it before. It is crunchy, but I think on a par with 4E and other fantasy systems. The concepts are easy to get, but the rules can take a few tries to get down cause there's a lot of them. I think Burning Wheel Gold is a must if you're getting it... cause it's basically the newer, cleaner, smoother version. <br/><br/>Honestly, there's a lot to unpack about Burning Wheel. The reasons why I think it might work for your zombie game idea is when you said "fraught with moral choices, and with an investigation in-between". Burning Wheel hits the sweet spot with player agency, character development, and meaningful choices. Beliefs, instincts and traits help make that happen. So, for a zombie game, where fast paced character development and tests of moral fortitude are at the forefront of the genre, that seems really fun actually! It might not hit the horror spot as well, but that might be something you can add. It certainly can have brutal combat... you get hurt, you're hurt for a long time. And combat is a mini game unto itself. <br/><br/>The only other thing I would suggest is looking at zombie games that exist, though I can't think of any off the top of my head, I know there's a few floating around that people really like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
