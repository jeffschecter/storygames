The first half moves 1 location in one direction and the second half moves 2 locations in another direction, during which time, the Chasers didn't move.<br/>\nThe Chasers are now 2 locations away from group 1 and 3 locations away from group 2 when a roll has them catch up 2 locations.  They have now caught up to group 1 but are still 1 location away from group 2.<br/>\n<br/>\n* I assume that when someone from group 1 makes a roll they replace Chase with Capture, but when someone from Group 2 makes a roll they still use Chase.

Not including that it's so easy to run I feel like I'm not doing enough work as a GM!<br><br>Bump 1 is how do we deal with Player vs. Player. Generally it's not a problem, but who rolls? I generally say, "whatever makes sense in the fiction." Otherwise, I have the person roll who has rolled the least in the game or has the most unanswered questions.<br><br>Bump 2 is often players want to help each other and they want it to matter mechanically. Which it does in many cases. You can help heal someone or help rescue someone. But can 2 players help each other accomplish the same action? Mechanically the game doesn't support that. That could just mean that the game isn't about that. You just describe each other helping in the fiction, even if it isn't supported mechanically. But I'e found players will stop describing help once it doesn't feel like it matters. Which isn't broken or anything. But they keep asking how they can mechanically help. Maybe that's just them expressing how tense the game is! You have to make hard choices so people want to find ways to soften those choices. Some other people are immersed in the situation and helping feels like it should matter somehow. Or maybe that's cognitive dissonance. I don't know. Not a big deal but something I've seen. <br><br>Bump 3 relates to your question. <br><br>What happens when goals seemingly override other mechanics? What if I succeed at my goal to escape but another category tells me I've been disappeared? What if my goal is to remember a memory but another category tells my I don't remember? What if my goal is to avoid the chasers but another category tells me the chasers capture me? What if my goal is to avoid harm but another category tells me I take harm? <br><br/>Maybe you simply can't have goals that are covered by other categories.<br/><br/>But what if my goal is to remember in the fiction? This has happened at least 2 times. I can't roll to remember because I don't have a goal. Sometimes there aren't any goals more important than remembering / escaping / not dying. But the goal category is a default category. You always roll at least 4 dice (unless you take Harm), one die which is for your goal. It's created clunky situations where we have to step out of the fiction and try to create artificial situations to make it all work smoothly. It's not a frequent problem, and I've run games where it hasn't come up at all. But I've seen it and other people have told me they've experienced it.<br/><br/>I wonder if Goal is simply not a default category. Just like Psi and Harm. When you have a Goal, simply roll and assign an additional D6.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357857/#Comment_357857" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-05T08:29:35+00:00" title="February  5, 2012  8:29AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, "bump 3" glared out at me right away...its my special super power / curse when I read rules :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nHow have you resolved Bump 2 in play?  I could immediately see "grant a helping die" or "make a roll with helping as a goal which allows you to grant a helping die" or "make a roll with helping as a goal which allows you to give whatever die you placed in goal to the other player (as is / same number)" as being viable options...but would the extra round of rollings disrupt the pacing of the economy?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe last option is interesting because it could double as a hinder mechanic as well.  If the die I put in goal is given to you (as is) and you MUST include that as one of the dice you use, then giving you a one might also be a way to handle certain PvP situations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357860/#Comment_357860" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-05T08:39:26+00:00" title="February  5, 2012  8:39AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 5, 2012 12:37PM by Jim_Crocker.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John,  think that the problem with the lack of helping rules is that a lot of people would consider it an integral part of the genre that then isn't supported by any concrete rules. In the game I played, there also seemed to be a huge reluctance to discuss the choices people were making with their dice; not only was there no mechanical support for aid, there wasn't any mechanical support for conflict in the form of mitigating another player's decision to be destructive. If another player said 'OK, so chasers don't catch up, I am unharmed, no question answered and I'll put this 1 on powers. What happens to the orphanage?' I felt like I had no ability to affect the outcome of that. <br><br>the main thing that took getting used to was that it sought to really reinforce the idea that youre a kid in an awful, confusing situation, and your agency is very limited by others. A much more overt spelling out of that as the main aspect of the game you'll be dealing with has players would help with expectations and help deflate the idea that players are getting into a 'superhero' game with this, because they're not!<br><br>On something of a tangent, I am going to see Chronicle this afternoon, which I expect to be totally in-genre for this discussion. I'll be keeping some of my critical eye open towards that, I expect. I'm looking forward to one or two moments where in my head I'm allocating their dice.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357875/#Comment_357875" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-05T10:27:54+00:00" title="February  5, 2012 10:27AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been tempted to hack helping but I really like the current pacing and balance of the game and don't wan't to disrupt it. I've really enjoyed the pacing. If something was to change, I would aim for the least disruptive changes possible. For example, when you help, if the person takes Harm, you can take it instead. <br/><br/>If I was to change any of the dice, I might be tempted to add +1 for help to the highest roll, rather than the lowest so we don't diminish consequences but rather increase success. But I like Ralph's idea better. <br/><br/>Ralph's idea of rolling to grant a helping die could also be fun because by rolling, you are increasing the odds something bad will happen which could compensate for the advantage of the help itself. Generally I think Meg likes the idea of more rolling, because it means more trouble :-)<br/><br/>Either way, Psi*Run is a pretty neat game!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357889/#Comment_357889" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-05T12:20:47+00:00" title="February  5, 2012 12:20PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, yeah.

I don't have authoritative answers but I can tell you what I think.<br/><br/><b>1. More rolling is fine. </b><br/><br/>For helping, either of Ralph's "roll to help" suggestions will work great; so will John's "your goal is to give +1 to her goal die." They expand the rules a teeny bit by adding bonus dice or modifiers, but are totally in keeping with their spirit.<br/><br/>"You both have the same goal, so both roll. If either of you put a high die in goal, you achieve it," is by the book straight-up and unmodified. So is "your goal is to protect her while she does her thing, so if you put a high die in your goal, she's not risking harm" and variations on it.<br/><br/>For PC vs PC, since both have goals, both players should roll. The game's rules don't provide an answer for mutually incompatible goals rolled simultaneously, so if both put high dice in goal you'll have to figure out what to do about it. I'd have both assign their dice blind, and whoever assigns the higher die to goal, theirs is the goal that happens. True standoffs - a tie in goal, and no other outcomes that change the situation - will be rare, and I'd just be like "it's a standoff! What do you do to break it?"<br/><br/><b>2. The results of one roll can be modified or undone by the next roll.</b><br/><br/>"The orphanage bursts into flames! Children die!" "Holy crap! Can I stop that from happening?" "Sure! What do you do? Roll for it."<br/><br/>You can do after-the-fact helping this way too. If I fail my goal and you want to help me succeed in it instead after all, you can make that your goal and roll for it.<br/><br/><b>3. Players are responsible for assigning their dice in a way that makes sense to them.</b><br/><br/>Ralph's example: my goal is to escape, I'm risking disappearing forever, I roll a 1 and a 6, and I assign the 6 to escape and the 1 to disappearing forever, so both happen. If that outcome doesn't make sense to me, I shouldn't assign the dice that way.<br/><br/><b>4. ...But you can rely on the first say rules too.</b><br/><br/>If I assign a 6 to my escape and a 1 to disappearing forever, the GM has first say over both. That's a risky play; by assigning the dice that way I'm asking the GM to reconcile them and agreeing in advance to whatever reconciliation the GM comes up with.<br/><br/>The first say rules suggest two answers to "my goal is to have a flashback that answers this question on my character sheet," a convenient one and a complete one.<br/><br/>The convenient one: "you can make it a goal to remember things, sure, but not to remember the answers to questions on your character sheet. Leave that for the reveal die."<br/><br/>For the complete one, here are the possibilities:<br/><br/>4-6 in goal, 6 in reveal: GM says what I remember, I say how it answers my question.<br/><br/>4-6 in goal, 4-5 in reveal: GM says what I remember, other players say how it answers my question.<br/><br/>4-6 in goal, 1-3 in reveal: GM says what I remember, but stops short of answering my question.<br/><br/>1-3 in goal, 4-5 or 6 in reveal: I have first say over not remembering, so it's my job to reconcile them. Maybe I just <i>know</i> the answer suddenly, without remembering anything, or something - but I can't figure out how to reconcile them, I shouldn't assign the dice this way.<br/><br/>1-3 in goal, 1-3 in reveal: No memory, no revelation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357891/#Comment_357891" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-05T12:24:32+00:00" title="February  5, 2012 12:24PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 5, 2012 12:39PM by Jim_Crocker.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I also wonder whether a 'softer' table so consequences ala Fiasco might not alter the game in interesting ways.

In the only game I played, it sort of ended up that the die rolls were always the climax of scenes that moved us on to the next area or scene, and had a narrative momentum to them that led us to just not think in those terms. The emphasis on making sure different players all got to roll before the same payers did an also felt like it weighed against that, but again, we were all first-timers.<br/><br/>The weird thing about my experience with it is that I remember the harshness of the dice being very frustrating to the point where I can't recall ever being particularly happy with my choices, but somehow ended up with a resolution for my character that I was really pretty pleased with overall. It was an odd play experience!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
