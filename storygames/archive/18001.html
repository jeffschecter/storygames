This is scary.<br/><br/>You see, the basic idea is to play out scenes from my life, when I was a kid and a teenager. I'll be using the hugely flexible and, in the end, unpredictable framework from "Play With Intent", which means I can have from zero to 100% influence over what happens. And I don't even know exactly what I want.<br/><br/>I do know that I'll be putting in some heavy themes there. Events that I only remember little snippets of, things that affected me a lot when I was a kid. Things that I'm not sure why I want to play out with my friends - I just know I want to try this out.<br/><br/>So. Exploration and experimentation. My main fears are:<br/>- That people will think I'm an idiot for doing this<br/>- That it will be horribly awkward<br/>- That it will just end up being silly<br/>- That it will just be boring and we won't be able to get into it<br/>- That I'll be emotionally exhausted by it (though that's not so bad)<br/>- That I'll be thrown into emotional imbalance for days afterwards<br/><br/><b>If you were going to do this, how would you prepare? And how would you play?</b><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406690/#Comment_406690" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-20T02:01:45+00:00" title="February 20, 2013  2:01AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're doing this with people you're already friends with, or with strangers?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406692/#Comment_406692" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-20T02:24:47+00:00" title="February 20, 2013  2:24AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mostly people I know, as that's the crowd that tends to come to HolmCon.

It's a beautiful game when done right.<br/><br/>What happens is: an interviewer talks the person through their life. It's broadly chronological. The very first question, which the interviewer asks, is: who would you like to play you? And the person chooses an improviser (a player, in our terminology) to portray them.<br/><br/>At any point during the interview, either the interviewer or the improvisers can decide to play a scene, based on something that's been said. It's part of their job to be respectful, to give the person a good time. It can go many ways: I remember, once, watching a scene about meeting an Italian family, which turned into a Godfather parody. <br/><br/>However, the person always has a veto. The interviewer keeps checking in: one common question is "Is that how it happened?". <br/><br/>It's one of the best improvised things I've seen. I've always wondered how you'd do it as a roleplaying game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406698/#Comment_406698" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-20T04:13:06+00:00" title="February 20, 2013  4:13AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent.

It takes guts. So my recommendation is to go in there and own your awesomeness. Even if the game ends up terrible -- which it probably won't -- at least you tried something new and difficult, so give yourself a little pat on the back for that.<br/><br/>Also, not planning a lot for afterwards is probably a good idea. I have been in your shoes recently, since I wrote a game about my experience with cancer, and found that running it sort of ruins the rest of my day. As in, I could hang out and listen to stuff, but not-so-much with the talking and playing other games. So be kind to yourself afterwards.<br/><br/>Other things to think about that were helpful for me: What's the most interesting part of your past for you? How can you push on that spot during the game? And what would you like people to say about the game afterwards?<br/><br/>Hope this helps!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406724/#Comment_406724" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-20T11:26:44+00:00" title="February 20, 2013 11:26AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, this is amazing. I wrote a game for a contest once that has now been eaten by the internet that was autobiographical and surrealist. The "main player" would quickly flesh out a number of characters and sets from their real life, and the other players would use those elements to frame scenes with. So you wouldn't actually play scenes from your life, but rather scenes from some mundane alternate universe. Which seems to be the way it'll go here, right? You can't fully play out scenes from your own life, but you can insert moments of reality around which everything else rotates. That's how I'd approach it.<br/><br/>I think this is bold as hell and your fears of idiot/silly/awkward are understandable. I don't think people will be bored, though. I think they will be hyper-invested if they know it's your life they're dealing with.<br/><br/>Please tell us how it goes!

If your community has the * that i think it's made of, they'll stand by you and be excited by the prospect of this experiment. <br/><br/>Wait, also, you're expecting to NOT be thrown into emotional imbalance for days afterward?<br/><br/>WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CHILDHOOD HERE. (ha!)<br/><br/>I would prepare by telling my co-players about my fears, and inviting them to share their uncertainties as well (i would limit this to a few minutes, total). Before gathering everyone, i would spend a long time getting into character. I would make sure to dread it, as i dreaded things when i was younger. I would take time to anticipate it as well, with that same feverishness. <br/><br/>I would build a safety-brake style "safe word / The Veil / try a different way / whatever" kind of thing to avoid silliness, and teach that to my co-players. <br/><br/>I don't think people will sign up to this casually, which is good. <br/><br/>I would play like i was falling backwards &amp; didn't have control, though that would be not actually true. I would trick myself. I would let the histories of my co-players bleed into the history we were re-creating. I would plan on being wiped out afterwards, and play something with a light tone later. <br/><br/>Sounds great!<br/>Excited to hear how it goes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406758/#Comment_406758" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-20T16:27:43+00:00" title="February 20, 2013  4:27PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure I would want to play?  <br/>I might have a drink or two.<br/>How long do you see this lasting?
