In any situation involving trust, after you threw dice you would put out your trust card and reveal. Then the dice would be interpreted with this in mind. If I betrayed you I could steal your high dice form the pool throw for my goal. or swap dice or something. In the early part of the game I could do stuff to get you all comfortable with my trustworthyness then, BAM! just before I was going to screw you you do it to me first. <br/><br/>Another cool thing one could do would be to have a group of cards which represent exersion. If we want to move something heavy we all pick a card representing the mount of effort we are going to put in. High exersion cards go away after use till the player has a refresh scene. Low exersion cards are returned to the hand every time. This would be very much like the BSG mechanic but could be brought into use in a lot of ways in RPGs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273301/#Comment_273301" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-27T09:35:00+00:00" title="May 27, 2010  9:35AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've had an idea for a while that still hasn't become a game, but I kind of love it: you're some kind of precognitive. To resolve conflicts, you draw a card from your personal deck, maybe use it like a d10 result or whatever. The coolness comes with the fact that your personal deck is not a full deck, it's something that you've built/been given, and it's small enough to make predictions about what's still to come. So I know my deck is like 10 cards, and I know that there's only 2 with a value less than 4, so I can play my character like I know the future, because I kind of do. When I get to my last card (right before I reshuffle) I essentially know the future, and I can play my character like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273313/#Comment_273313" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-27T10:26:58+00:00" title="May 27, 2010 10:26AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Cards as Shared History</b><br/><br/>My newest playtest version of Drift has a simple card deck, to clock the amount of effort a player can exert in a conflict. One of the side "mechanics" though is that when the conflict reaches a minimum level of importance each player who drew an empty card writes or sketch something about the current situation on one of them before returning it to the discard pile. What this means is that over time, the deck becomes filled with important, interesting, or just incidental elements of the different worlds and missions the player characters have encountered - a ripe opportunity for reincorporation or just a list of recollections. Over time, fresh empty cards get added to the deck to ensure that there is still the opportunity to add new elements.<br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273334/#Comment_273334" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-27T12:22:33+00:00" title="May 27, 2010 12:22PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Unlike with dice, card probability changes as you draw (sage's idea and the article's cards as timer rely on this).  If you draw the Ace of Spades out of the deck, now there's one less Ace in the game and one less Spade in the game, until you reshuffle.  This is how card counting works in Blackjack.  In a large deck, this effect is small (hence why Vegas casinos use multiple decks), but in a small deck it card be very useful.  If you deal the entire deck without shuffling, you can guarantee that a given card will come up eventually.<br/><br/>So you could have a balanced system of random character generation.  Instead of "roll 3d6 six times in order" you draw six cards, from a deck of six cards. Then the next guy reshuffles the deck and does the same.  You both have the same six values, but in a different order, so you're better at different stuff.<br/><br/>You could take it a step or two further and let players choose from multiple decks that are all balanced against one another.  One deck has 3, 8, 10, 11, 13, 18 while the other one has 5, 6, 9, 12, 15, 16 or some such.  Both decks total to the same, but one deck can be swingier than the other.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Also: Front and back of a card can give you useful tricks.  Chrononauts uses the front and back of a card to represent different states of a timeline (and has that idea patented).  Maybe each character has traits that are both good and bad for them.  Conflicts would consist of me trying to flip my cards to their good side (and using the advantages written on that side of the card), while you try to flip my cards to the bad side (and take advantage of the weaknesses described there).<br/><br/>A Larp system that I saw recently had special abilities printed on two sided cards.  The user read their side, which explained what they were doing and how it worked.  The person the ability was used on read different text on the other side, telling them what they experienced and the minimum rules for them to respond to the ability.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273337/#Comment_273337" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-27T12:30:54+00:00" title="May 27, 2010 12:30PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also: trading cards from hand to hand, such as in Settlers of Catan or the whole Gin/Rummy sort of family could be useful (and stealing cards as well).  My warrior needs several Rage cards to activate his big attack ability, but wants to get rid of the Sympathy cards he has.  Your priest uses Sympathy cards, so we can arrange for a mutually beneficial trade.  But the evil illusionist queen NPC can steal those Sympathy cards away when we trade, or some such.<br/><br/>Combine that with a system of Keys where each PC generates some types of cards but only can spend other types, and you get a situation where trading is necessary.  Then you set the PCs to be at least partially opposed to one another for entertaining play.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Deckbuilding: like in Magic the Gathering or its various knockoffs.  Maybe at the start of a game, you have a bunch of Scene cards, saying "Romance" or "Intrigue" or "Mysteries to be Solved" or "Sudden yet Inevitable Betrayal".  Each player picks some of these cards to go in the Scene deck, which is then shuffled.  Then in play, the scene deck tells you what sort of scene to do or gives bonuses/penalties to certain kinds of actions.  (Each card could have effects on play until some condition is met, perhaps, at which point it is replaced by a newly drawn card).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thor" title="thor"><img alt="thor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/thorhansen/Pictures?authkey=Gv1sRgCKPylM61jtOQbA#5529849930194336866"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thor">thor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273339/#Comment_273339" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-27T12:39:39+00:00" title="May 27, 2010 12:39PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            that sounds a lot like Dominion, but I like the feel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273340/#Comment_273340" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-27T12:41:54+00:00" title="May 27, 2010 12:41PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Stacking the Deck: <a href="http://www.atlas-games.com/piecesofeight/" rel="nofollow">Pieces of Eight</a> is nominally a game with pirate coins about ship battle.  But what it really is is a collectible card game where you stack the deck.  You decide ahead of time what order to put your resources in, and then take your secret strategy to face your opponent's secret strategy.  Partly this works because you can plan traps for your opponent, and partly it works because you always have two or three different abilities available.  But you never know exactly what will happen, because you don't know your opponent's setup.<br/><br/>It could be really useful for a couple of kinds of roleplaying games.  Maybe you're secret spies, and each time you uncover a new secret/layer of identity of your opponent, it gives them new abilities and resources to use against you (and your goal is to penetrate to their real identity).  Maybe you play kung fu masters, switching stances and maneuvering to find new openings.  Maybe the mechanics could be used to give a strategic feel for a game about fencers or chess grandmasters.<br/><br/>Or maybe it lets you plan out a character's story arc ahead of time but not have it be written in stone how and when it happens.

Most of the play in the game is in rearranging the order of the line so that you get the nice big value noblemen for yourself.<br/><br/>But you could have the line of cards be used for other things.  In a more traditional, combat oriented game, you could use it for turn tracking in combat, something like Feng Shui's shot system.  Maybe everyone gets a number of cards with their name on it (determined by a Speed attribute or the like), and those are shuffled and dealt out in a line.  <br/><br/>Different abilities can rearrange that order around in conflict.  Maybe my attack does some damage but also moves your next card back some spaces.  Maybe my quick attack lets me hit and move my next card up some spaces.  Maybe my attack does damage to the next person to act.  Maybe just placement on the line is used as a stand-in for damage/hitpoints: if you have no more cards in the queue, then you are out of the conflict.<br/><br/>This is a bit like having a random deck, except everyone can see the upcoming order and possibly do stuff to change it to their advantage.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King" title="Double King"><img alt="Double King" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King">Double King</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273352/#Comment_273352" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-27T13:33:43+00:00" title="May 27, 2010  1:33PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One i like a lot and not yet mentioned, is the deck in San Juan.

So there's a good chance that some of the cards that you're waiting on could already be in-play as coins; and may or may-not be shuffled back into the deck in a timely fashion.<br/><br/>One of the designers who advised on San Juan later went on to produce Dominion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273360/#Comment_273360" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-27T14:25:11+00:00" title="May 27, 2010  2:25PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An early card game that combined uses of the cards for resolution and representations of things in the game was Avalon Hill's Up Front.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273379/#Comment_273379" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-27T16:45:52+00:00" title="May 27, 2010  4:45PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The story-focused skirmish wargame I wrote, <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1164498/Bullet%20City.pdf" rel="nofollow">Bullet City</a>, uses a shuffled initiative deck with a Joker that triggers a reshuffle of the deck.

I've been pondering cards as a way of adding some cool 'gamey' elements to an RPG in ways that are hard or impossible with dice. Two things I thought I'd point out that might be too obvious to be worth mentioning, but it's all I got:<br/><br/>1) To go back to Magic: the Gathering for a moment, one element of that game I really appreciate is the way the land cards work, on a couple of levels. For one thing, the land card itself isn't the resource you need to do spells. It's the generator of the resource. Secondly, playing with what proportion of your deck is land cards is an option (all though it turns out there's an optimized number, something like 1/3 or 1/4, it's been awhile since I played) because you need enough to power your spells, but not so many that you don't draw the spells you need! Third, there's 5 different kinds! and depending on the set, these all interact with the spells in various ways. It's a very complex resource system, but super easy to grasp and play. That's good stuff.<br/><br/>2) Munchkin from Steve Jackson Games does a pretty darn good job at getting a dungeon hack out of a card game, with no map or anything. I kind of wonder as a thought experiment if you took the Munchkin rules, rewrote them all serious-like, made new 'normal' dungeon crawl cards for each category, and presented it as an old school revival RPG what sort of effect you'd get                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273398/#Comment_273398" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-27T23:44:28+00:00" title="May 27, 2010 11:44PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            jackson tegu's game "the smoke dream" uses a deck of cards to represent a story that's heavy on repetition - you don't ever shuffle the deck, so generally you encounter cards in the same order over and over.

I loved that game! Even after I picked up on miniature wargaming per se, I still played and enjoyed that game (also, the quality of components was pretty super great for a board game - I use that tower included, with a few modifications, as scenery with "real" miniatures). I had forgotten about the cards for activation of units until you mentioned it.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JCunkle</cite>I wonder now if it really was an improvement.

Your hack basically went to more risk, less gamble, whereas the original system allows for the swirling tides of war to be represented by more of a gamble system. One thing I've seen in wargames with card drawn activation of units is to vary the frequency of certain units' activation to represent initiative or speed (going through the whole deck on a turn, then shuffling it or starting it over in the same order, or whatever). So, a possible compromise would be to have both sides units in one deck, but the commanders get the option of adjusting the frequency of different units (but are capped at how many total cards they can have, and maybe every unit must have one card).<br/><br/>To get this back to story games, I could see this being a pretty interesting combat initiative mechanic. Just replace "units" with "moves" and "commander" with "player"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273627/#Comment_273627" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-30T02:03:37+00:00" title="May 30, 2010  2:03AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I use a fair few card deck devices in my games Bogeyman and its precursor Fearmonger. <br/><br/><b>Cards as Health Track :</b> each players' hand of cards is their health. Run out of cards and you could be hurt. Each time you take damage, you have to discard cards to the value of the damage and, unlike regular tests, you don't get to redraw them. This simulates increasing impairment from physical and social damage making it harder to accomplish goals. The major advantage of this method is that you don't have to write anything down on the character sheet. You know how healthy you are, and how much damage you can take, from the cards in your hand.<br/><br/><b>Cards to Encourage Voluntary Failure : </b>in Bogeyman, the key to success is making sure your hand of cards has as many good cards as possible when you really need them. There are several ways to get rid of bad cards, the most common being throwing them away on less important tasks that you don't really need to accomplish.<br/><br/><b>Cards to Encourage Player Interaction :</b> Another means of getting rid of bad cards is inter-party conflict. If you face off against another player, both players are going to be able to get rid of a bad card. It makes for interesting social dynamics within the group.<br/><br/><b>Cards as Mood Indicators :</b> Another Bogeyman tip. Each suit can represent one or more statistics, and only cards of that suit are worth they face value. That means the cards you have in your hand dictate what tasks you're most likely to excel at, and are a good indicator of mood. If you've not got many Power suit cards in your hand, you may be tired. If you've not many Intellect cards, it could be because you're scared or confused.<br/><br/>I'm a big fan of the use of cards in serious games because they give far more tactical options to the players if used properly than a bunch of random dice can.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273633">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273633/#Comment_273633" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-30T03:29:27+00:00" title="May 30, 2010  3:29AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Using the red/black divide as a symbol of blood magic.

But it could easily be a small deck assembled on the fly.<br/><br/>Say each PC has a bunch of cards on them.  Each card has their name on it.  In a conflict, you take cards from each involved character.  All these cards are shuffled together and one is drawn.  The person running that character gets to narrate what happened/won the conflict.<br/><br/>Perhaps putting cards in is spending a resource: once you spend your 40 cards, you're out of cards for the session.  Or perhaps you can put in a number of cards determined by your skill rating or something: I have Guns at 7, so I put in 7 cards; you have it at 4 so you put in 4 cards.  I have a better chance of winning, but not a guarantee.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
