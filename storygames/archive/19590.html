For those of you who don't know, the series takes places in a fantasy renaissance-esque city, and follows a group of characters as they commit Ocean's 11 style heists. I've been chomping at the bit to run a game focusing on this type of play. I know there is Leverage, but how does it handle non-modern games? Also for those who have played it - does the flashback mechanics become too ridiculous? Or better yet is there an alternative system or hack that's been created to run this type of game?                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435406/#Comment_435406" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-16T19:21:26+00:00" title="July 16, 2014  7:21PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wordstudio/project-dark" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wordstudio/project-dark</a><br/><br/>must be mentioned.<br/><br/>Leverage would work pretty great shifted back in time: there's nothing in the game that really prevents you from time-shifting it, and the flashback mechanic will do lots of work in helping the team work together while separate and unable to communicate.

The Roles aren't from any time period, except Hacker. So you can use as-is. F'rinstance, Jean might be a Hitter/Grifter while Locke is a Mastermind/Grifter and Sabetha is a Grifter/Thief. Distinctions are 100% freeform, which works well. And the Attributes can stay the same, since they're just physical. Everything else boils down to the Fixer giving traits to everything, and Traits are freeform.<br/><br/>The only thing you have to wrangle are the Hacker Talents (since the role doesn't exist any more), but the book has guidance for how to homebrew Talents. Plus, watch out for Talents that presuppose radio communication like the Archangel talent for the Mastermind.<br/><br/>Also, I really like the poster who posted after me and pointed out how well BW would work for GB.

The Hacker is about gadgets and information.  There are a  few talents that don't work at all, but if you change most of the rest to medieval or steampunk gadgets and use their ability to get into quickly, you're gold.  It's also very easy to make new talents.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435715/#Comment_435715" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-23T22:47:37+00:00" title="July 23, 2014 10:47PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Blades in the Dark</i> is about a gang of criminals.

BW characters just fail more often than Locke and Jean et al do. Locke and Jean end up in rough situations partly because of occasional failed rolls (especially when they're completely out of their element like the sailing parts of Book 2) but mainly because the villains simply outclass them.<br/><br/>YMMV of course. But I know that I personally would be leery of using BW to try to "do" GB and expect a similar feel in the fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435858/#Comment_435858" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-28T05:26:14+00:00" title="July 28, 2014  5:26AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Though Locke and Jean are at least 5-6 LP characters....
