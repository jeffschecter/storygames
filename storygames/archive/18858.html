You duel other wizards by creating and countering spells <br/>Check it out here: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wizard-war/id702839715?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wizard-war/id702839715?mt=8</a><br/><br/>So, to try to make it *slightly* more on topic: I think from a game design perspective there are a few interesting things to consider. The multiplayer in Wizard War forces people to play live, at the same time. Half the fun the game is that you have to play it *with* someone, preferably in the same room. I think that roleplaying is fun for the same reason. I've tried asynchronous RPGs and they are nowhere near as fun. I'm kind of hoping that more quality shared experiences are created for phones and tablets. <br/><br/>Another interesting game design bit from Wizard War is the exploration aspect. The game teaches you a few spells, but you're supposed to experiment to figure out the rest. Personally, I love experimenting with games and figuring things out and I hope that comes through as part of the fun here. In the earlier versions, you could explore, but there was no feedback mechanism. It was amazing how much of a difference it made to add the skill progress bars, the single player quest and the spellbook. It was already fun to explore, but it's almost like you didn't realize you were having fun until a progress bar said you were. The game needed that extra sense of accomplishment. <br/><br/>Anyway, let me know what you think, and sorry for the off topic. <br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
