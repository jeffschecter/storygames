The first residents were adventurers who came here several years ago: the actual adventurers went into the dungeon and never came back, while various henchmen and camp followers were left behind. The first few times this occurred the henchmen went back home, but as new parties arrived and found the old campsite, and improved upon it, things started to grow. The tipping point came when a particularly large and well-funded expedition left behind what amounted to a small fortress, 10 listless armsmen and food and other supplies for months; these men never went home, they just decided to stay here.<br/><br/>When that first choice of setting up a permanent camp was made, things started to quickly accumulate: new adventuring parties would arrive regularly and discover this little piece of civilization out in the wilds. They would pay for bare necessities like a safe place to sleep, food, equipment. Some of them would stay instead of traveling back to a real town in between expeditions.<br/><br/>The camp/fort only really became a boomtown when some adventurers really struck it big in the dungeons. As adventurer hopefuls flooded the town, certain social dynamics became dominant:<br/><b>*</b> Adventurers no longer arrive as party expeditions; rather, they arrive one by one and form their expedition parties right here.<br/><b>*</b> The original "stay-behinds" who turned the cold camp site into a permanent home may have envisioned a pioneer lifestyle, but not so with the newcomers arriving with the boom: the ones who don't want to be adventurers want to be the service industry that leeches easy money off the actual adventurers.<br/><br/>Looking at this, what I'm seeing is a small wooden fort occupied by what amounts to a clan of militant hardholders, surrounded by a boomtown. The "stay-behinds", as I'm calling them now, are the formal town authority due to having been here first and basically having decided that they own this place. The town's been here long enough for the claim to stick, but not so long that you can't find people who well remember when this place was just a convenient camp site.<br/><br/>I envision the stay-behinds as relatively militant because that's the most common cultural context in our D&amp;D games for big dungeon expeditions: they are essentially mercenary operations. When the flower of the mercenary company went underground and never returned, the one or two senior sergeant types left in charge at the camp naturally took charge. Because the main assets of the future town at this point consisted of the remains of the over-sized adventuring company - various junk that adventurers tend to lug around, like crossbows and rope and mules and whatnot - as well as the semi-fortified campsite, the stay-behinds had natural reasons to stick together rather than spreading around: they had safety in numbers, and by staying and sticking to the organization they maintained individual claim to shares in what may have amounted to a meaningful amount of wealth for poor henchmen. Once this arrangement had been around for a couple of years and the stay-behinds realized that they were sitting on top of a trading post of sorts, the continuity of the arrangement was secure.<br/><br/>This being the case, I suggest that the head honcho of the place is a sheriff type, who might ironically be called "the Castellan" by the townsfolk because he lives in the fort. He's the leader of the stay-behinds, who in turn form the town guard and used to do everything around here before the boomtown started to, well, boom. The Castellan is elected by the stay-behinds from their sergeantry, the senior rank of the organization. It's not a true military so much as it's a citizen militia, as many of the stay-behinds have other jobs aside from soldiering.<br/><br/>The stay-behinds collectively would probably like to control the economy of the town, all the more so when it's started to boom, but we don't want that design-wise - it's not a proper boom-town if there's a strong central authority gathering the cream. It is credible that the stay-behinds are unable to mount the out-of-control tiger of a town <i>now</i> that the boom's on-going, but why couldn't they clamp down and develop their own monopolies when it was all just starting? I figure that there must have been a power struggle, dramatic events that shaped the town and forced the stay-behinds to become merely the most powerful faction in town, rather than an absolute aristocracy over the rest. I see this pertaining to the powerful adventurers who pass through, and do not necessarily accept any and all claims of authority.<br/><br/>Perhaps I'll get back to this story later. Let's see what others have.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468774/#Comment_468774" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-09T04:43:12+00:00" title="January  9, 2018  4:43AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is a motte and bailey castle.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468775/#Comment_468775" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-09T04:44:43+00:00" title="January  9, 2018  4:44AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There might be some smithies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yhsper" title="yhsper"><img alt="yhsper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yhsper">yhsper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468776/#Comment_468776" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-09T12:22:10+00:00" title="January  9, 2018 12:22PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 9, 2018 12:26PM by yhsper.">edited January 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some slightly anachronistic groups for Boomtown:<br/><br/>Mapsellers: synonym for "crook". Some people say the dungeon change everytime you go in, some say it stays the same. Nonetheless, map sellers have a bad reputation in this town. These can be found in tables at the back of taverns and dark alleys, preying mostly on newcomers to Boomtown, promising routes to treasure troves or previous parties&amp;apos; TPK sites.<br/><br/>Agents: old adventurers or entrepreneur types who invest their time and money on particularly promising dungeon delvers, expecting a cut of the profit.<br/><br/>The Inconsolable: a group of men and women who lost their loved ones in a dungeon collapse some time ago. Their main activity is protesting and sabotaging adventure parties, trying to stop them from going in.<br/><br/>Vultures: roguish adventurers who enter the dungeon alone and follow novice parties from a distance, waiting for them to perish to loot their still warm bodies.<br/><br/>Goldbugs: beggars who crowd the dungeon entrances, waiting days and nights for adventurers going in or out to ask them money. Goldbugs are actually a good information source on who&amp;apos;s currently inside the dungeon and since when.<br/><br/>And a location idea:<br/><br/>Old Boomtown: a ghost village nearby, since its\xa0 dungeon was cleared. Adventurers often leave Boontown&amp;apos; s dungeon through Old Boomtown, since the two are connected. Some folks still live there though.

Destroyed and by demons and undead, in later centuries humanoids and other horrors took up residence. Far away humanity recovered as petty kingdoms, before once again uniting and growing in power. A population boom has brought expansion. The desolation of the ancient empire was generally left to rot despite the wealth that would still be there.  Based on the Klondike gold rush idea and the "Ton of Gold" that came into Seattle. Of course, many became wealthy just selling equipment and supplies.<br/><br/>Another idea is reclaimation and cleaning of a Moria type dungeon. This is orchestrated  by vast groups of adventurers working off a surface base camp, clearing out areas, and carting out what they find. Another might be a region of barrow mounds such as in tLotR or in The Black Company. Perhaps a Valley of the Kings style collection of tombs. After being overun by undead and hunanoids, the gods have delcared a crusade to clear it out with extra XP for resanctifying the tombs. <br/><br/>Perhaps going another way, what if certain types of ore are a conduit for spawning monsters. Like the veins of dead god, until the mine is tapped out\u2014they\u2019ll keep respawning. Perhaps the veins are sentient, almost plant-like. The raw ore has to be mined and then hauled away to be smelted and purified. But the miners need to be safe, so the adventurers have to go in first. They get a claim on any treasure found along the way. <br/><br/>There would also be \u2018Canaries\u2019, the human kind, not birds. The nickname given to them, taken from the oft-used method of using a canary in a coal mine. Murderers, molesters, rapists, and other undesirables given the choice of going into the dungeons rather than swinging from the gallows. They\u2019d be ferried into the boomtown from larger cities in civilized areas. So you\u2019d need a place to temporarily house them and the jailer would be an important figure. Serious local crimes could also result in the judge laying down harsh punishment and the accused becoming a Canary. These are dead men walking, fiend-fodder, monster-bait, whatever else you want to call them. They could work as alarms for the miners and if they are lucky enough to make it out alive, maybe, just maybe, their restitution would be paid. But chances are, however, each and every one would die a horrible death. Impaled by iron spikes, drowned in black pudding, beheaded by a bugbear, crushed in a vice trap, flayed and eaten alive, a damn-near endless number of ways to be killed. Still there\u2019s always a chance.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468813/#Comment_468813" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-11T04:23:55+00:00" title="January 11, 2018  4:23AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/vgunn" rel="nofollow">vgunn</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>There would also be \u2018Canaries\u2019, the human kind, not birds.

"What where you convicted for" added a quick element of characterization on top of race+class+alignment, and everybody had picked "neutral" on the good-evil axis anyway.<br/>OTOH, I wouldn't use this sort of starting point at the same time as gold-rush mega-dungeons and dungeoneering boomtowns. In fact, the very point of the "adventurer as a sentenced convict" setup is to establish dungeon-delving as an anomaly, not a regular lifestyle in the setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468817/#Comment_468817" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-11T12:58:15+00:00" title="January 11, 2018 12:58PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 11, 2018 10:58PM by Paul_T.">edited January 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's certainly a valid way to look at it.<br/><br/>However, if this bizarre thing we call a "dungeon" exists in the world, who knows how people would react?<br/><br/>Perhaps the place has a surplus of convicted felons and nothing obvious for them to do?

This would pressure guards/militia/whatever law enforcement's out there to arrest "undesirables". Now, I don't know how many canaries you'd need - presumably, the lower a canary's life expectancy, the higher the need for replacements - but this might create a conflict of interest. Town needs canaries, criminals are canaries, town needs criminals. You can see where this is going.<br/><br/>Second, if criminals can be ferried in, then this means other goods can as well. This implies the boomtown has reasonably close ties with whatever greater government exists. But if we're going with a prison colony (makes sense, considering the need for prisoners), then there might be some tension. Maybe, as the players walk the streets, they come across an ambushed guard patrol. Or maybe the town's run by an army, colonial style. The players could side with a faction, or exploit the situation for profit. Then again, if the situation deteriorates too far, then the monsters in the dungeons might sense an opportunity...<br/><br/>To make friends, of course.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
