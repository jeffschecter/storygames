And, sometimes that's useful - some of those terms are pretty loaded, and problematizing their use might be a good thing.<br/><br/>But often, we end up miring good conversations by demanding a clarification or substitution of terminology.<br/>And that's frustrating.<br/><br/>The problem, as I see it, is that we're lacking some useful terminology. Or rather, I'm lacking some useful terminology and you might be too.<br/><br/>The issue: Vampire and AD&amp;D don't belong in the same category. Neither do The Shab-Al-Hiri Roach and Spirit of the Century.<br/>But "our" definitions are typically binary and aim to be all-inclusive (to describe everything about a game, instead of a component).<br/>So trad might get used to describe Vampire and AD&amp;D, while indie might get used to describe Roach and Spirit.<br/><br/>Anyways, I'd be happier if I knew how to use terminology that ACTUALLY reflected the qualities of game that were being called into question.<br/>"GMless" and "GMed" are great terms in that regard. Categorizing all games under those labels makes sense. It improves the ease of discussion.<br/>I say that even while recognizing that there are games that don't fit that binary (some games with 3 different player roles, etc), and that games within one category or another are wildly different from one another (Ribbon Drive and the Shab-Al-Hiri Roach, for example).<br/><br/>Stepping outside of the practice of categorizing games altogether seems impossible for us. So, instead, I'd love to know a lexicon of categories that actually describe games and their playstyles meaningfully, that interact with one another, that compliment one another. I'd love to understand games as inhabiting a point in a 3-dimensional space, rather than on a singular line between "trad" and "progressive".<br/><br/>Are those conversations already going on?<br/>Do those understandings of categorization already exist?<br/>If not, am I right in wanting them to?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/marknau" title="marknau"><img alt="marknau" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c29/marknau/dwarf.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/marknau">marknau</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266674/#Comment_266674" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-12T11:51:46+00:00" title="April 12, 2010 11:51AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, you know how when you ask pandora why it picked a particular song for you, it says something like "Intricate melodic phrasing, groove-based composition, pop metal qualities?"

Categories are useful shorthand for large groups that share similar qualities or lineages. The problems is is that there relatively few published RPGs. So it's easier (and more methodolgically sound) for me to talk about, say, 3:16 in it's particularity rather than trying to reduce it (and a number of other games) to some larger category. Only then to make a problematic comparison or description using this category, which would only mystify 3:16 itself. <br/><br/>Even the 'trad' distinction is problematic: D&amp;D3.x-4ed play doesn't really look like either Vampire or Rifts. They all have GMs but beyond that all the similarities in experience would be because of cultures of play and meta-game assumptions being brought to bear. What I might say, it that the distinction between 'trad' and 'indie' might correlate to a number of games historically speaking, but that really they're cultures of play or play style. What's controversial is that the implicit thesis that "Rules don't matter that much."  To borrow from anthropology, language doesn't constitute our experience of reality, it just draw attention and highlights various experiences. Then, the rules are significant but aren't total. <br/><br/>So, don't worry about it, Joe! Be descriptive and not prescriptive.

'Trad' is a pretty useless term, in most discussions.<br/><br/>These three games are all GMed.<br/>All three are dice-ful games.<br/>Vampire and Rifts both have canonical settings (and D&amp;D has an assortment of canonical settings).<br/>Vampire is a relationship-centric game.<br/><br/>Talking about those qualities is useful. Understanding how to talk about qualities-as-categories is useful as well.<br/>Understanding that Vampire and It's Complicated are both relationship-centric games is a useful realization.<br/>It can help us think about whether there's play methodology that's transferable, it'll help recommend games, it'll reduce the learning curve in understanding <i>why and how we play these games</i>.<br/><br/>In an ideal world, where we have lots of time, lots of patience and lots of critical thinking capability... I would just describe Vampire to you for an hour or two, and then you'd think about everything I said and understand it on the first go, and then you'd think critically about all the other games you'd play, and then you'd say "AHA! This game bears some similarity to It's Complicated, based on a component of play that you have described, and that leads me to thinking about how you might also like it!"<br/><br/>But in the real world, conversations don't happen like that very often. So having a conversational short-hand is useful.<br/><br/>I'm not saying we should run out and make a bunch of terms and force people to use them.<br/>I'm saying that I wish I had the language to have conversations about different kinds of games.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Nathan Wilson</cite>To borrow from anthropology, language doesn't constitute our experience of reality, it just draw attention and highlights various experiences. Then, the rules are significant but aren't total.</blockquote>\nSo, I'm aiming to: use language (some of which will be specialized) to highlight various categories of experience, in order to generate context for our discussions of specific experiences.<br/><br/>Saying "trad" and "indie" is not an effective way to achieve that goal, primarily because the only context they provide is about identity politics.<br/>So I'm looking for the right words and language to effectively provide context, so that we can get down to what really matters in a conversation.<br/><br/>Now, if I say that Apocalypse World has a GM role, what I've done is brought us 70% of the way to being on the same page.<br/>In under 20 words, I've provided a lot of context. That's a useful tool to have, the word "GM".<br/>Of course, it's only useful if I make it that remaining 30% of the way by foot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266696/#Comment_266696" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-12T12:37:20+00:00" title="April 12, 2010 12:37PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite><br/>So saying "Tranditional GM" role although accurate is useless.<br/></blockquote>\nAnd to echo the argument I just made to Nathan: Saying "it has a GM" brings us 70% of the way to having a conversation.<br/>The remaining 30% is "...who pre-constructs towns that are being distorted by sin, and who pushes the PCs to confront complex situations and deal with the fact that their ideology puts them into hard choices."<br/><br/>There's a lot of information contained within the term "GM".

Or is that stuff left for play advice?  I always got the impression that Vampire was mechanically just another game of its era with some heavy flavor troweled onto it.<br/><br/>It doesn't seem to be possible to play Its Complicated without creating and focusing on a fictional relationship -- can the same be said of Vampire?  Does that matter?<br/><br/>I was initially thinking along Mark's lines, that a set of attributes could be defined that would describe an RPG, and that hopefully each attribute could be defined so that would be unambiguous about whether a game possessed one or not, just by examining the text.  Things like: points-based character creation, random character creation, rotating antagonist, one player plays NPCs, oracular situation generation, antagonism budgets...<br/><br/>My hypothesis is that you'd see huge attribute intersections among swathes of games, and from those intersections, classifications like 'old school' and '90s trad' could actually coalesce usefully....\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Agreed!  But then we also need good terms for play-style, right?</blockquote>\n...but how useful is it to do that without considering play style at all?  This is a big problem for less-focused designs where: <br/><br/>a) parts of the game's agenda were purposefully left undefined--as in a toolkit game like GURPS, <br/>b) where the game agenda is incoherent -- the play advice says one thing, and the game mechanics say another.<br/>c) It also isn't helpful for games like D&amp;D that are almost entirely defined by local culture.  D&amp;D appears to me to be strictly about killing and looting, and that's how I try to DM it, but D&amp;D has been drifted into more things than are known in your philosophy...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266741/#Comment_266741" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-12T14:16:48+00:00" title="April 12, 2010  2:16PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>It'd be cool if someone who is not me could come up with a simple three axis differentiation you could map to color and intensity.

I had distinct aspects of the games associated with cardinal directions. For example, North became the direction of Roles, which meant that GM rather than GMless translated to the Inner North - while more complex, stricter, or unusual Roles translated into further frontiers in that directions.

I don't talk a lot about games but I do talk a lot about theory. The problem there is that each term is used and abused by different thinkers in different ways at different times. Ideology has probably a dozen particular definitions, and a more specific (singular) definition attached to who's using it. Yet, there is much fruitful discussion. Moreover, that discussion is <i>necessary</i>. Categories are tedious. That AW has GM doesn't even get me 70%, it just brackets all the game I can think of that have GMs. Even if you had a series of tags to apply, I still wouldn't really 'get' AW until I had played it. Even then. What those tags would tell me is what it wasn't like. Yet, AW could only ever stand in for itself. Or maybe John Harper.<br/><br/>While I agree with most of your post and I don't mean to undermine your project, I'd like to point out that generating context via pregiven categorical knowledge is difficult and time consuming work. Say, I don't know or don't understand these new categories and then we go to have a conversation about Vampire. You say something like "Vampire is team-based player-niche drama." I'll just ask you to unpack those terms. Then you spend an hour or two talking to me about terms and not Vampire. <br/><br/>For myself, I'd rather just have that conversation. Can we have that conversation, Joe? I've never played It's Complicated but I did play a bunch of games of the new Changeling. Maybe I can buy you a coffee at GPNW and we can live in you ideal world for a few hours.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266755">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266755/#Comment_266755" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-12T15:11:36+00:00" title="April 12, 2010  3:11PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 12, 2010 3:12PM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think that "trad" and "indie" are about games, so trying to label games as one or the other is generally going to be a mess. But really they are used, as far as I can tell, to refer to paradigms of social organization &amp; assumptions about roleplaying in general. They are associated with particular games only in the sense that in some cases the games encouraged one set of organizing principles or assumptions over another -- a very real and useful association, mind you, but not one that is even remotely vulnerable to a criticism based on the unlikeness of Feng Shui and Vampire: The Masquerade. The use of the terms does not imply any relationship directly between any two games, it just implies an indirect relationship having to do with the formation of social principles.<br/><br/>So I kind of feel like to some degree (unrelated to its general usefulness otherwise) this thread is an attempt to defend a straw man (from JD Corley, no less, there's some irony here somewhere.) I do think the idea of more refined terminology is a nice goal to pursue regardless, but it doesn't seem necessary in order to keep conversations on point -- that mostly just requires the people involved to want to keep them on point, instead of getting up in arms that some people use words differently than they do.<br/><br/>I do kind of wish people would just get over the fact that terminology is imperfect -- it's not some personal affront, people, it's just how language works.<br/><br/>Also, Nathan seems to be saying everything else I would like to be saying, so that's good.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266767/#Comment_266767" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-12T15:48:35+00:00" title="April 12, 2010  3:48PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You could do something of a scale.<br/><br/>Like GM-Narrator-Director-Referee<br/><br/>GM is literally master, their word is law, ultimate control<br/>Narrator is just a step down - the story and pot is in their control<br/>Director is starting to step on shared story-telling, the players are sort of in Actor-Writer roles, and the director pieces things together<br/>Referee is pretty much shared storytelling responsibility with a single adjudicator - the role is only really distinct in the case of disagreements<br/><br/>If there's a GM you as a player can expect input in your own character's actions, but not control of them<br/>If there's a Narrator you as a player can expect control of your own character, but no input in the story<br/>If there's a Director you as a player can expect control of your character and input in the story<br/>If there's a Referee you as a player can expect control of your character and of the story<br/><br/>That's a lot more useful than GMed and GMless, and usually the term used in the rulebook (unless it's GM) will reasonably reflect that scale.<br/><br/>Another thing that could be looked at is tagging - have a set of unmarked characteristics, and use d20/D&amp;D as the benchmark - something's only marked if it deviates from D&amp;D, so a game could be described in a list of features that it has as different from D&amp;D.<br/><br/>diaspora has shared world &amp; setting building, shared character generation, character advancement by change, narrative input by players - those are significant characteristics that stand out<br/><br/>reign has hit locations, multi-axis task resolution, complete flexibility in random and designed character generation<br/><br/>heroquest has paragraph and make as you play character generation, fuzzy encounter difficulty, unlisted character traits, conflict resolution                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266769/#Comment_266769" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-12T15:58:29+00:00" title="April 12, 2010  3:58PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 12, 2010 3:58PM by Johnstone.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Name me: one. single. piece of terminology. that this community uses consistently and never has an argument about.<br/><br/>Do we really need to close the terminology gap?

You have to be able to present the information so that someone else will understand it, which means you'll need to establish what they already know, correct any misconceptions they have (without calling them idiots, preferably), determine from their demeanor and their questions whether they're following along with you, and generally give them the information in whatever format makes the most sense to them.  Maybe you can get there by talking, maybe you need to give them something written, maybe you need to show them a quick hands-on demonstration...and if you still get it wrong after all of that, you have to go back and try a different approach.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266814/#Comment_266814" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-12T21:02:42+00:00" title="April 12, 2010  9:02PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite>Johnstone said, "If you want a shorter way to describe games accurately, start with an accurate description, then make it shorter."<br/>That's what I was asking.<br/>How do you do that?</blockquote>\nAren't you saying I just did that to your original post?<br/><br/><br/>Pick something you want to describe, then describe it. Then refine it. First, try to make your description better by yourself. Then take it to somebody else you know who you know understands what you are describing, and have them take a pass at it. Rinse, repeat, refine. You have more training in communication than I do, man. What do those skills tell you to do?<br/><br/>And then you unleash it on the internet. Or just email it to JD Corley. If there's any bullshit terminology still embedded in the description, he'll find it, and tell you it's wrong. If he can't find some way to make fun of it, then it's probably done.<br/><br/>That's the process, though. What about the substance? Games aren't monolithic entities, either.

You just need to be aware of what you're describing: that term does not capture any game design solutions inclusively, it just asks whether the target game or idea is derived from Forge culture. (The answer in this case is a simple no, incidentally: there is no reason to suppose a link where there is no proof of such, not even any of the idiosyncratic Forge-like mechanical solutions.)<br/><br/>It seems to me that the general problem in using various terminology is that people are relatively uninformed and lazy, not that there is a particular lack of terminology to use. To begin with, the whole notion of a robust universal terminology is a fool's errand; different discourses have different needs, terminology that would be highly relevant to one might be irrelevant to something else. The fact that "trad vs. indie" doesn't capture D&amp;D 4th edition particularly well (it being a post-Forge mainstream game) does not prove that those terms are vague or somehow bad; it just means that they're not suited to the occasion.<br/><br/>I tend to find the terms I need myself in rpg discussions from a couple of pretty powerful sources: if pure rpg analysis a la Big Model doesn't do it and the Forge-style historical analysis doesn't do it, then it's likely that I can borrow litcrit terminology or perhaps even boardgame theory terminology and find something useful. I don't remember that any discussion of mine would have been stymied for the lack of <i>words</i>.<br/><br/>To demonstrate:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite>The issue: Vampire and AD&amp;D don't belong in the same category. Neither do The Shab-Al-Hiri Roach and Spirit of the Century.</blockquote>\nVampire and AD&amp;D have many similarities and differences. I might describe one of the most prominent differences as the difference between "adventure game" and "storytelling game"; AD&amp;D presupposes a game with challenges and mediated interaction to enjoy semi-chaotic outcomes, while Vampire presupposes a dramatic exercise with literary creative goals, coordinated by a GM. Both use similar systematic tools derived from the same sources, such as being party-based, mission-based, GM-dominated, niche-oriented and character effectiveness -oriented, which justifies calling them both "traditional", to pick another piece of terminology. There are also lesser similarities and differences - we can talk of "simulationism" vs. "gamism" to hone in on the creative agenda of the exercise, we can look at literary genres of "D&amp;D fantasy" vs. "neo-gothic horror", we can look into mechanics like "linear roll vs. target number" vs. "dice pool"... there are an arbitrary number of different ways for those games to belong in the same or different categories, and the terminology we choose depends on that. There is no God-model that'd capture the essential nature of individual games for all purposes, or even all purposes likely to be discussed on a web forum. Some people used to try to make GNS into such a God-model, but it just happens to be that saying that a game is "simulationistic" doesn't capture nearly everything that might be relevant about it. Pretending that a single label can exhaustively replace a conversation is naive.<br/><br/>(Shab-al-Hiri Roach vs. Spirit of the Century, by the by, is a case of "GM-full" vs. "GM-less", as well as "narrativistic" vs. "simulationistic" and "campaign-friendly" vs. "one-shot" and "adventure drama" vs. "comedy of manners" - the similarities of the two include aspects such as "procedurally well-defined" and "liked by many of the same people".)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266831/#Comment_266831" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-13T01:55:06+00:00" title="April 13, 2010  1:55AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Liked by many of the same people can apply to almost anything.

If, by "that," you mean "a nice term that gets at what I mean when I tell my friends I like 'indie' games without insulting everyone and being clear to everyone, everywhere."<br/><br/>Two, had I not been as lazy \u2014 or perhaps as interested in catching eyeballs \u2014 I could've done it better. I could've subjected it something like "Is <i>Savage Worlds</i> right for me and people like me?" Then in my question, I could've been very explicit and avoided this idea of "Forge-dervied" in the first place. But honestly, "Forge-derived" is just my substitution for "indie" as I use it colloquially, but if I'm talking on the Internet, I don't want to be pushed into a stupid definitional fight over what "indie" is.<br/><br/>For me, Forge-derived fits. (I'm stealing the term from Vincent Baker, for the record.) There is a definite trend-line in design (or several of them) around games that either were partly created around Forge forum discussions, or are influenced greatly by those games. I want to talk about that. I can be specific about the things I'm looking for, but I figured asking it that way was a lot nicer way of saying "Hey is this just a tarted-up version of D&amp;D?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/marknau" title="marknau"><img alt="marknau" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c29/marknau/dwarf.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/marknau">marknau</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266965/#Comment_266965" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-13T14:46:55+00:00" title="April 13, 2010  2:46PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the world of boardgames, a particular style of game is often called "Eurogame" (even if it is designed by an American, like Alan Moon.) And another style of game is often termed "Ameritrash." And yes, that second term has been embraced by many people who prefer that style of game, despite the inherent controversy. Sometimes the Eurogame is called a "designer game" (like the others spring up out of the ground?)<br/><br/>I think any terminology used will give someone an excuse for dispute.

I think, broadly speaking, that most of us up on the evolution of the hobby know what you mean.<br/><br/>Where I take issue is when negative assumptions are packed into those definitions.  And I'll fight that every time.  I'm sure you all have a sense of how that happens when it is used with the word 'indie' (= pretentious wanker self-promoting designer auteur game).  I've gotten into some pretty hot water on many forums fighting tooth and nail against that kind of characterization.<br/><br/>But I see it here as well in the way a lot of people bring up 'trad'.  I do think a lot of the time here on storygames it is done more in honest ignorance than outright malice (though on the forge I'm not so sure), but it is enough that an aware gamer who has a preference for trad games and plays them well could feel slighted and thus the silo gets reinforced.<br/><br/>So my critiques here were not to utterly destroy the terms or to break them down to the point where they are rendered useless, but rather to point out that there are a lot of negative presumptions packed into the definition that are inaccurate and harmful to the well-being of our wonderful hobby.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266970/#Comment_266970" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-13T15:04:03+00:00" title="April 13, 2010  3:04PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 13, 2010 3:30PM by Brian_Minter.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess any description along these lines has the potential to offend / irk / alienate someone.

If, by "that," you mean "a nice term that gets at what I mean when I tell my friends I like 'indie' games without insulting everyone and being clear to everyone, everywhere."</blockquote>\nGah, no, that's precisely not what I mean.<br/><br/>What I mean is that I lack the vocabulary to describe the types of games that I like, so instead I just use these hand-wavey terms like "indie".<br/>If that works for you, rad. Sorry to have misused you as an example.<br/><br/>I want to be able to communicate about the substantive differences and meaningful groupings of games, rather than using a binary that doesn't even speak to me in the first place.<br/>I want to be able to talk about types of games, not games within the context of a design timeline.<br/><br/>In my understanding, games have multiple, overlapping types. Andy used the term "tags" and I like that - you can have ten tags attached to something, and they interact to tell a story about what the content will be. Tags don't replace content, tags provide guideposts about content. Tags are not exclusionary of other tags... most can exist in tandem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267004/#Comment_267004" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-13T18:56:52+00:00" title="April 13, 2010  6:56PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the notion of tags too, I just wonder how useful it'll be in discussion.

Andy used the term "tags" and I like that - you can have ten tags attached to something, and they interact to tell a story about what the content will be. Tags don't replace content, tags provide guideposts about content. Tags are not exclusionary of other tags... most can exist in tandem.</blockquote>\nYeah, totaly! I love tags and this is exactly why. For instance, I used to sort pictures on my computer into folders, like Photos/People, Photos/Landscape, Drawings/People, Drawings/Landscape, Drawings/People/Fantasy, and so on. When I discovered I could tag them instead, I jumped ALL over that shit--now I can search for whatever parameters I want within my tags, and get a "folder" composed exactly of my needs of the moment--"medieval, female, mail, or "elf, horse, outdoors" and so forth. And it saves my brainspace from trying to decide what a particular thing "is", which I think is the <i>real</i> ppint for this discussion. Descriptive, not Prescriptive, yo.<br/><br/>Of course we still run into the problem of definitions; like Joe mentioned he wasn't getting much from my Action/Drama distinction, and to be honest I wasn't exactly married to it either--I was fumbling for words to assign to some concepts that are distinct to me, but hard to define. So someone would probably have to ask me, "what do you mean by 'Drama'?" and I'd have to say something like, "oh, y'know, social conflicts based on tricky relationships and personal issues, as opposed to conflicts that are solved by punching stabbing or shooting."<br/><br/>But that's OK maybe; the tags act as a start, not an end, to the discussion. There's no debate to be had; you're not <i>defining</i> PTA as a "Drama game," you're describing something about PTA, and if the simplest, shortest terms don't do it, you ask questions and elaborate, until you reach understanding.

Compare that to, say, if "rock" was the only label on the shelves on which ALL that music rested. have fun reading spines and back covers for the next five hours!<br/><br/>That said, now that tagging is "hot," maybe the way to go is to do  the tag build up... and then look at sets of games that accrue the same tags and decide on a descriptive category for such games, while ever acknowledging that it's just the first "navigation level" through which one might drill to get to the fuller tag set, which is just ANOTHER navigation level before you're actually reading the back blurb or executive summary of the game (which is STILL just another layer of descriptive--you won't KNOW the game until you've played it, repeatedly).<br/><br/>I find those who say, "categories can't describe a game, man!" to be laughable. Why do we call some practices "board games" and others "RPGs" and others "mini games" and others "card games" and others "LARPs?" Sure, there's TONS of overlap and edge cases... but the VAST majority of language users get a pretty clear picture of the activity when we use those terms.

Tagging is a model of categorization that fits with what I'm talking about.<br/>Tagging is, more or less, what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>Joel and Johnzo listed examples of specific language that does what I'm asking about.<br/>Daw65/Dave Wilson linked an example of a site that relies heavily on this sort of thing, to good effect.<br/>Mxyzplk described better than I have the usefulness of the stuff I'm asking about.<br/><br/>So, like, people: I'm not suggesting we invent codes, that we re-define indie/trad, that we spark a revolution, that we start doing something new.

I think you're saying you'd like to know what the universe of elements are that we could use to describe RPGs.
