It's as if all the tools I'm given just make it so easy for me to make things worse and harder for the characters. Sometimes it seems every single choice they make will be between two evils. And the ideas I come up with on the fly tend to make their lives more difficult, always. <br/><br/>How about you? Do you have a sadist in you?

It's strange, but the more invincible the characters are, the more sadistic I can be. In <b>This Is Pulp</b>, they can't be harmed in any way which mean I can put them in any kind of situation. Tied to a driving car? Sure. While falling into a volcano?

If they can't be killed easily then the players keep feeling invincible, kicking doors and doing stupid things just because they believe they will get away with it. For me, going sadistic is actually manage to scare them a bit in the fiction with the help of some good inmersion.<br/><br/>I recall one trick I used to make them have second thoughts about kicking the ass of an NPC who was actually going to help them (yes, my group is that kind of group) The party was invited to the palace, in the presence of the empress, when the mentioned NPC was announced. As they began making plans to kick his ass just for the fun of it I explained that they were in a room with a really tall ceiling (say, five meters maybe a bit less) ... and that the new arrived had to bow to get in. That worked. We had an interesting scene with lots of social conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nifelhein" title="Nifelhein"><img alt="Nifelhein" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/888/nUG22UPKX7MJD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nifelhein">Nifelhein</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403250/#Comment_403250" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-09T16:15:13+00:00" title="January  9, 2013  4:15PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am extremely antagonistic as a GM, I have found out that throwing dice openly or not throwing them at all helps me be closer to the players in wanting them to succeed, though I still like to bash them, take everything they hold dear, throw it away and give them a bloody grin while doing it.<br/><br/>I am evil.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403348/#Comment_403348" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-10T12:36:02+00:00" title="January 10, 2013 12:36PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 10, 2013 12:38PM by omnifray.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a lovely, sweet GM but for some reason my players always <i>think</i> I'm evil.
