By this definition, ZC is completely devoid of character creation, because there are no mechanical components of character. <br/>\n<br/>\nBy another definition, character creation is a set of guidelines which, when followed, ends up with a character having been fleshed out to a sufficient state that they can be played. ZC has this, even though those guidelines are completely optional. <br/>\n<br/>\nBy a third, character creation can be completely unguided, with the closest thing being the directive "come up with a character/concept".<br/>\n<br/>\nI lean toward the first definition, but accept the second as valid for games with no mechanical character bits. The third bit I don't accept as valid for any game in which characters are important.<br/>\n<br/>\nNathan, as this is your thread, which, if any, of these three definitions are you working from when you ask your question?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/edheil" title="edheil"><img alt="edheil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/edheil">edheil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207776/#Comment_207776" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-17T07:34:51+00:00" title="May 17, 2009  7:34AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Back in the early 90s I was reading Umberto Eco's works on semiotics and literary theory, and thinking about how our understanding of a fictional entity is constructed in the course of reading a narrative about that person or thing.<br/><br/>I was also occasionally participating in rec.games.(frp).design, and watching FUDGE being designed by Stephan O'Sullivan.

It does require players who are expert in Hero System, which is what I had.<br/><br/>In the first game, the opening shot was of each character's shoes, as they arrived in the conference room to hear why they had been brought together to investigate the missing expedition to the world's deepest cave in Mexico.  That was the game with the great telephone exchange. "Dust bin." "DUST BIN? Are you sure!"  "Oh, ah.  Ash Tray!  Ash tray."  "Oh! Whew."<br/><br/>Note that some players are Design-at-Start and others are Design-in-Play, and some games work better for one than the other, so it can be handy to figure that out.<br/><br/>Also, I've noticed some players (especially immersive) like time to develop a feel for the character before making big decisions, so would like to go through some routine before breaking the routine.  Games that start in media res with a big kicker can lead to unhappy outcomes for them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208690/#Comment_208690" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-22T05:59:21+00:00" title="May 22, 2009  5:59AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of my Game Chef entries, Liquid Crystal, starts off with a blank character sheet that is filled in as you play. Characters don't even start with a name, they have to think of one for themselves while the game is going on. The PCs play learning robots with the capacity to develop personalities of their own, on the condition that they are psychoanalysed after eight hours of operation and if they look like turning into dangerous psychopaths they get their memories and personalities erased and have to start again. As the game develops, so do their four emotions. These start out at zero, and can gain both virtuous and viceful points that increase the robot's abilities but also affect his personality. If by the end of the test period they are mostly well-balanced individuals they avoid the big wipe and reset.<br/><br/>It's still one of my favourite mini-games, if only for the Cue Cards. See, robots start off with only a simple face made of liquid crystal (hence the title) which can only display the most basic of emotions using emoticon-style images. I included a set of printable flash cards, each with a useful expression on, that characters could hold in front of their own faces to show what emotion they thought their robot was currently displaying. Always loved that idea. Robots that make it through the test period get their own unique hand-crafted face capable of proper human emotions.<br/><br/>If you poke around the old Game Chef sites you might still be able to find a free download of Liquid Crystal somewhere.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208707/#Comment_208707" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-22T09:18:27+00:00" title="May 22, 2009  9:18AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Nathan H</cite>Are there any games that start you off with a big complex character sheet, then get  whittled down thru play?</blockquote>Little Game Chef entry <a href="http://davidartman.com/rpg/the-sea-worshippers" rel="nofollow">The Sea Worshippers</a>.
