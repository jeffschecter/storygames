Here's my situation:<br/><br/>I'm running a post-apocalyptic game, based on the court of Clovis I, with four players using a pretty traditional game system (Silhouette by Dream Pod 9).  Our play group tends towards a more traditional style - PC's cooperate rather than conflict, players are moderately self-directed but keen to involve themselves in what they perceive as "the Plot", PC's prefer to operate as a group.<br/><br/>This last one is a stumbling block for me.  I have a relationship map of NPCs with conflicting desires who are "grabby" - trying to pull or push the PCs, befriending them or manipulating them, and generally leading into trouble of some form.  I try to craft the NPCs agenda, and the occasional Bang, to target each player character's specifically - offering them opportunities to make choices, thematic statements, and highlight their character's prowess in their own arena.<br/><br/>The way I've been framing this is as scenes where the player character is approached by an NPC, usually alone (as the NPCs don't want their discussions overheard in general).  However, the scenes are always played out at the table in the presence of the other players so they can act as audience.  I've even encouraged non-participating PCs to jump into scenes if they felt they had a reason to be there.  And I've tried to divide attention as equally as possible among the players, but the non-verbal cues are that they are somewhat detached during scenes their character isn't involved in, and the verbal feedback is that they prefer group activities.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, since verisimilitude is one of my big hang-ups (and strengths as a GM), I'm having trouble convincing myself as to why these previously private relationships would grow to include the other PCs.<br/><br/>I'd like suggestions on how to accomplish two things:<br/>1) Make better use of NPC agendas &amp; bangs to involve the entire group, even though they are very different characters with different motivations<br/>2) Make better use of individual scenes to evoke more energy and participation from the non-participating players<br/><br/>Here's the ideas I've come up with so far:<br/>1) improve pacing - keep individual scenes tighter and shorter<br/>2) Weave (from Sorceror) - re-incorporate elements from one players scene in another<br/>3) Cross-cut between multiple scenes, building toward tension simultaneously (has issues with passage of in-game time, and actively prevents some types of PC collaboration)<br/>4) Have non-participating players offer suggestions for the current scene or NPC<br/>5) Have non-participating players play NPC roles in the current scene (difficult in some cases because there are setting secrets / agendas the players are unaware of but wish to discover/be surprised by)<br/><br/>But I'm sure I'm missing some very good ideas - namely yours.  Anyone else have some good suggestions to offer?<br/><br/>As a corollary - am I falling victim to a form of <a href="http://culturesofplay.com/comments.php?DiscussionID=31&amp;page=1#Item_12" rel="nofollow">The Shuttle Game</a>?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147729/#Comment_147729" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T15:14:05+00:00" title="June  3, 2008  3:14PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Make bangs where an NPC approaches two PCs at once.

Still: as a gm I like to entice them, giving them attention and alliance-offers from mighty lords (inviting them to dinners, giving balls to their honors, referring to them as "a boon to the country" in official circumstances, etc.). Most players jump at the attention and smiles broadly to the flattery, and subsequent proposals.<br/><br/>More often than not I get them into alliances with lords that turn out to have mighty enemies, which in turn also turn their attention to the PCs, and offer them alliances, and will be very cross if refused.<br/><br/>We may call it <i>cross-pressure</i>.<br/><br/>This cross-pressure may be combined with <i>split lojalties</i>: I try to get players to talk with the mighty one-on-one sometimes, and underline that this is a great honor! And then I let the lord give them an offer they cannot refuse, forcing them into conflict with the lojalities of the group. It is dirty by me, of course, but it is effective and fun.<br/><br/><i><b>Cross-pressure</b></i> and <i><b>split-lojalties</b></i> are the two most used tools of mine in intrigues, I think, together with the occational <i><b>goldrush</b></i>. The "goldrush" is a gift that binds the PC in ways the player don't perceive. Or he/she see the unfortunate binding, but the consequences of turning down the gift is worse ...<br/><br/>To place the group or single players in dilemmas pertaining to the intrigues are great fun!<br/><br/>Hope this was of some help.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147768/#Comment_147768" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T16:49:53+00:00" title="June  3, 2008  4:49PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The main way I resolve this is in campaign design.
