From GenCon again this year, woohoo! We're doing a fundraiser to help us get some new gear and to help us spread out across GenCon. I'm really excited.<br/><br/>Please drop by our Indie Go Go page and check out the great games you can get as Reward levels for helping us out! I'm talking about stuff from Lamentations of the Flame Princess (two custom designed monsters), Atarashi Games (signed and printed games from Mr. Richmond... already sold out, sorry!), Galileo Games (a bulldogs! story and adventure and a Mortal Coil Adventure Frame built for this fundraiser) and Heroic Journey Publications (Mecha goodness!).<br/><br/>Also, we're offering game sessions at GenCon as a Reward level. I'm running something (Lady Blackbird, InSpecters, Shotgun Diaries, or Lacuna Pt. 1) for a table and we even have the Iron GM perfect score GM Erik Frankhouse running a session at a private room catered event, too!<br/><br/><a href="http://igg.me/p/119631?a=163043" rel="nofollow">Indie Go Go Campaign for TJI</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
