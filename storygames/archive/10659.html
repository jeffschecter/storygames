What if you created a game, available online, that people could subscribe to?<br/><br/>Each week (two weeks, month, or any other time period), you could release more content for your game. Now, I'm not just talking about what you find in 'splatbooks' for more traditional RPGs, but fully-realized rules that would expand or change the game in a noticeable way. One model I was thinking of (which was brought up in the Shirt Fight thread) was the card game Fluxx, where, as you play, the rules change.<br/><br/>Has this been done before?

I wrote a blog post about this a while back, but haven't published it for some reason. To me it seems that some games are very much serialized - most powerfully so Dungeons &amp; Dragons, which is built from the beginning into a non-discrete, evolving thing. I've been reading D&amp;D literature from various phases lately, and it all seems to me like a part of an extended dialogue, a serial discourse that explores the different directions you can take a "D&amp;D-like" fantasy game.

And most web comics stand alone even if serialized (i.e. they're semi-episodic). So I don't think offering (say) a new monster is good enough. I should think a whole module, Town, or Oracle set (or similar) would be a minimal thing. Alternately, a whole game (i.e. a mini-game, or something like Lady Blackbird).<br/><br/>Perhaps one could make sub-modules? Kind of like a series of stand-alone modules, each of which can be mixed or matched with others (with a bit of GM effort), but which can be run in the order presented for the "full, canonical" module. Something like the "chapter a week" author model, but each chapter is a sort of short story with generic characters, and the short stories compile together into a full "novel."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237489/#Comment_237489" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-14T12:41:50+00:00" title="October 14, 2009 12:41PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What if you turn it around?<br/><br/>Say you regularly produce modules/mini-games that you have to pay for, but for free you put up really well written Actual Play.

The problem is that RPGs resist serialization.</blockquote>\nIs serialization a necessary part of the model, or just a function of the model being developed for (newspaper style) comics?<br/><br/>It seems to me that what you need is: "Give away the primary source material in order to build fan support and investment, then sell supplementary material that sells because of that built investment."<br/><br/>And giving away your rules for free is one way that you can increase people playing your game.  <i>Playing the game creates investment in that game</i>, particularly for campaign modes games that last for more than a handful of sessions.  Playing a campaign is its own form of serializing the primary content, and builds the player investment that you're aiming for.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Here's my anecdotal evidence that this model works just fine for RPGs, in at least some cases:  By giving away the rules for 3.5 D&amp;D for free, Wizards of the Coast made at least $400-600 from me and my friends.  <br/><br/>We had been playing 3rd edition when it first came out, and when 3.5 came around, the entire group was resistant to it.  None planned on buying any 3.5 stuff at all, as we had enough 3.0 stuff to last for years.  But when my wife decided to start a new campaign, she said that we'd use the 3.5 rules, available <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/" rel="nofollow">for free online</a>.  If we liked the rules changes, we'd stick with it, and if not, we could go back to the old rules or something entirely different.  Well, we liked the slight changes in the newer rules, so as the campaign went on our investment in the campaign and the 3.5 rules grew and eventually everyone owned the core books and a couple supplements.  If the rules hadn't been available for free, we'd have been playing 3.0 or something totally different, and some other publisher would have gotten that money (or it wouldn't have been used on gaming).<br/><br/><br/>That includes the traditional RPG supplement treadmill stuff, but our investment could easily have been funneled into buying t-shirts or other any other supplementary material that rewarded and built on our player investment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_237561">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237561/#Comment_237561" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-14T16:17:44+00:00" title="October 14, 2009  4:17PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey,<br/><br/>I've been thinking about this for a fantasy game I've been working on, called Heart of Ashes.<br/>By "thinking about this", I mean thinking about how to do modular release of the setting &amp; situation elements.<br/><br/>Doing a Wednesday &amp; Friday "webcomic" format would be perfect.<br/><br/>Quick outline of game: You're children who stumble into a dark &amp; scary fantasy world. You realize you have magical powers. The adults there want that power. They want you on their side. Nobody's exactly good, nobody's exactly evil, but in dangerous times everyone gets greedy. The GM introduces groups/leaders/monsters, and if the players like one, they can buy a Key of the [group/leader/monster], and it becomes an ongoing force to be reckoned with (and to draw XP from).<br/><br/>As a result of the game's structure, you need lots of groups/leaders/monsters to cycle through, bits of colour and interesting little situations (say, a paragraph description of a village, and the two groups that are struggling for power in it). The game specifically invites a "take the elements you want, and stitch them together" approach. A webcomic release of that stuff would be perfect. Doing it by paper = people wouldn't buy it, doing it by PDF = it would clutter desktops. Webcomic style = rad.<br/><br/>Now, the game could be available as a free PDF, but you could also buy a pretty book (say, a $15 softcover which contains the first 20 of those neat-o groups/leaders/monsters/situations. 3 villages, 5 groups, 4 leaders, 4 monsters, 3 specific situations). Either way, you get to access all the ongoing updates.<br/><br/>Hmm!<br/><br/>Thanks, Ben/Charlie for the idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ptevis" title="ptevis"><img alt="ptevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ptevis">ptevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237564/#Comment_237564" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-14T16:28:24+00:00" title="October 14, 2009  4:28PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Two things:\n<ol>\n<li>As someone who regularly generates and distributes content for free, I'll point out that you should to have <i>something </i>you can sell as way for your fans to give you money.

With serialization you get people who are all into it talking about it with each other, or constantly sharing it with new people.  Webcomics in particular get linked to people or put in IM away messages or whatever frequently.<br/><br/>Compare this with say Cory Doctorow who has all his books online for free under Creative Commons.  If you read something of his there's going to be a limited window while you read it and afterwards during which it will be fresh in your mind and you will bring it up with other people.<br/><br/>With serialization you're constantly given reason to talk about it, and being reminded there is associated product you can buy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_237588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko" title="Seth Drebitko"><img alt="Seth Drebitko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w135/sethbashwinger/fetusgoplayavatar-2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko">Seth Drebitko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237588/#Comment_237588" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-14T18:05:12+00:00" title="October 14, 2009  6:05PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Reign is a pretty good example of this.

These are independent enough that somebody who liked what you published week n could still use it even if he didn't like what you published week n+1, but are related enough that the "stuff" as a whole still forms a coherent picture. This should happen at regular intervals, maybe with smaller "sub-stuff" pieces published even more regular, just to hit that sweetspot of internet attention. At regular intervals, like every couple of months, you put the material together and publish a nice, print(on-demand)ed edition for sale, MAYBE with some extra bits but nothing that's integral or NECESSARY. While doing all this, also have various other things for sale that's related to your "stuff", prints, merchandise, whatever.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Ok, that went somewhat more abstract then intended. I'll give it another try thta hopefully makes it more clear what I'm thinking of.<br/><br/>Let's imagine I want to write up a sorta Scifi rpg this way. I set up a pretty-looking page, with blog, rss feed, maybe a wiki or forum, whatever. (And an online shop, of course.) The first month or so, I publish as much stuff covering the groundwork as possible. If I use an existing setting (I keep thinking of TSOY for this for some reason.), here is where I set it, if I make my own I start with the basics. Maybe I subdivide the first month, like every Sunday there's a few pages of rules and every wednesday there's a couple of pages of setting/fluff/pictures, whatever. Each of those should be interesting on their own, so I'd try to make both enjoyable to read and as pretty as I can make it. I'd also try to work some stuff up before going public, so I have both some material already on the site when it starts as well as a reserve should some real-life come up. (Skip weeks are a bad idea here.)<br/><br/>After the basics, I'd probably have "theme weeks" or whatever, where I'd publish a series of related pieces that combine with others. One week, this might be "Nation X", with Fluff on Monday, some Crunch like Keys or whatever on Wednesday and maybe some powers on Friday, so that by the time the Sunday hits, you have everything you need to run a game in that nation. Or maybe it's an adventure, with NPC on one day, an encounter or two the next and so on. These "theme weeks" shouldn't be too long: Talk a month about Nation X and you risk that the people who aren't interested in Nation X stop reading and never notice when you cover Area Y that's totally their thing.<br/><br/>After the first month or two, there should be enough material for a small print version, about as big as the Roach or so. Also, if something is really pretty, like a nifty illustration, I could set up the shop to sell a nice print (Maps!!!), if it is usable, like a pack of cards or dice, it should be in the shop, if it's funny, why not put it on a mug? Here, we try to sell stuff, while never, ever trying to look like we're desperate for cash or making anything that's really <b>necessary</b>. So if the game uses cards, make sure that you have the files online for people to make your own (While selling pretty versions on your site.), if it uses weird dice make sure that it works without too much fuss with regular ones (While selling awesome-looking weird ones.) and if it's a map, make sure it's available as a download. (And maybe a pretty poster for sale.)<br/><br/>Also, keep an eye on the readership and listen to what they say. If people keep asking about, dunno, a notepad of character sheets, try to create one and put it up for sale. If they keep asking specific questions, put up a FAQ. If people keep using Races X,Y and Z in Areas A, B and C, maybe a small print version of just that material could sell well. Basic advice, but still.<br/><br/>Also, two also basic but IMO integral things:<br/><br/>1. Make it easy for people to give you money.

As I posted above, the "web comic model" doesn't require serialization at all, just regular content drops and merchandising.<br/>---<br/>It just occurred to me that a cool way to do this would be to NOT have a single RPG or setting or what-have-you. Rather, make it more of a resource for a variety of gamers. Maybe one day you put out a cool trap idea for any game with mechanical traps (i.e. a logic puzzle, basically). Another day you write up a weird alien or fantasy race, with stats for a variety of generic system (d20, HERO) to make it easy to convert. A third day you make a DitV Town.<br/><br/>A cool element to this is that you could expand your audience a lot faster than if you relied (a) on a single RPG or (b) a single scene. Hell, make board game rule variants and downloadable supplement (I'm thinking of new Zombies or Carcaissone stuff). A Mechaton or Mage Knight battle scenario. Etc.<br/><br/>Maybe not quite "web comic model"--more of "web aggregator model"--but the content is still free, with revenue coming from compilations or from merch.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237719/#Comment_237719" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-15T11:53:55+00:00" title="October 15, 2009 11:53AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: timonkey</cite>With serialization you get people who are all into it talking about it with each other, or constantly sharing it with new people.

And it's  rather germane--sorry you see it as dickery--because my idea actually IN the post (did you read past the point of being incensed?) speaks to a "web comic style" of RPG content distribution that would be utterly NOT serial, just frequent (and free and merch-supported: the rest of the "web comic model" under discussion). I point out the definitional distinction so that the discussion will NOT be limited by a narrow concept like serialization.<br/><br/>And so, no, for this thread I do not think your (custom) definition of serial applies, obviously. Unless "linked in some way" suggests "from the same source," in which case your definition is trivially generalized and thereby of minimal utility. Whereas serial (like the show 24 or a soap opera) implies a contiguous plot that each episode advances. Episodic is more like The Simpsons (or Penny Arcade): common characters, but no single plot line (barring occasional "mini-series"). Then you've got stuff that's semi-episodic like The Office: one can enjoy a single episode and that episode's situation resolves (or continues a tension), but there are nuances to an episode that one will miss if one is not aware of and caught up with the overarching plot line.<br/><br/>So, for "RPG" purposes, a "serial" would be like what a lot of folks have mentioned here: a single product (rules, setting, races, monsters, etc) which is released over time, and then maybe monetized with a compilation and accessories and merch, as Bret mentions. A "semi-episodic" RPG would be more like what I suggested in one of my earlier posts: each thing is stand-alone, but maybe they all come together to form an overall story arc (e.g. a bunch of modules or situation that can play alone, but actually form a complete series). And then an "episodic" RPG-related thingamabob (site, I reckon?) would be more like what I put in my previous post: no two releases have anything to do with each other (beyond the trivial "links" of a single author--though not necessarily, come to think of it!--or a single repository/source).<br/><br/>Perhaps you mean to use the term "series" and confuse it with "serial"? Or maybe you mean the somewhat more archaic meaning of "serial" which is merely an indefinitely continued, numbered publication? That's kind of applicable to the "web comic model," in that they are typically numbered by date. But, then again, they can often be read out of date order and still be funny, as would (I imagine) many "web RPG" products, particularly if they are conceived as stand-alone or system-agnostic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237926/#Comment_237926" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-16T18:49:07+00:00" title="October 16, 2009  6:49PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps series is better.

I decided it might end up like io9 is for me: a handful of stuff i care abut, and so I never visit the site, just read the RSS. This kills monetization.<br/><br/>That made me think of a site with "portals," like IGN--each portal could be its own blog with its own RSS feed (i.e. each is a subdomain).<br/><br/>And THAT got me thinking that it might need to be more than a one-person show, lest the content within a single portal be so sporadic that none of them gain traction. Maybe work it like Cracked, where you have contributors that just do it for the recognition or fun? But that's straying rather far from web comic model, into the more generic, "magazine" model.<br/><br/>But not wanting to solve the problems of assignment and publishing management (and payment) I then thought of doing it in "spurts" where you might go for a couple of weeks in the (say) D&amp;D Portal only to shift to doing a few Town in the Indie Portal, finally ending up over in the Eurogames Portal for the last week of the month with some Carcaissonne re-skin or expansion(s).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238361/#Comment_238361" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-20T10:38:01+00:00" title="October 20, 2009 10:38AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 20, 2009 10:41AM by Neko_Ewen.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ptevis</cite>As someone who regularly generates and distributes content for free, I'll point out that you should to have<i>something</i>you can sell as way for your fans to give you money.

They basically said that print editions of webcomics sell surprisingly well. One artist said that he feels insulted when publishers try to say that the comic is worth less because it's free online; in a way it's worth more because it's had years of advertising and building up a fanbase. One artist finally did a print version like 5 years after her webcomic had ended, and still sold through a print run of 500 copies.<br/><br/>Also, it was mentioned on another thread, but if you look at the store for any given webcomic, they'll typically have T-shirts, buttons, stickers, prints, etc., and at conventions these can sell even to people who've never heard of the comic. Of course, RPGs would need to have more and more distinctive visual elements than they usually do to pull that kind of thing off. The 3:16 pins are <i>awesome</i> in that respect, but I can't think of any RPGs that would lend themselves to, say, plushies like with <a href="http://www.nemu-nemu.com/shop/softgoods.php" rel="nofollow">nemu*nemu</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ru_Baraba_Dom" title="Ru_Baraba_Dom"><img alt="Ru_Baraba_Dom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/559/n1DT8PKZTUJ28.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ru_Baraba_Dom">Ru_Baraba_Dom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238379/#Comment_238379" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-20T11:30:54+00:00" title="October 20, 2009 11:30AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite>As a result of the game's structure, you need lots of groups/leaders/monsters to cycle through, bits of colour and interesting little situations (say, a paragraph description of a village, and the two groups that are struggling for power in it). The game specifically invites a "take the elements you want, and stitch them together" approach. A webcomic release of that stuff would be perfect. Doing it by paper = people wouldn't buy it, doing it by PDF = it would clutter desktops. Webcomic style = rad.<br/><br/>Now, the game could be available as a free PDF, but you could also buy a pretty book (say, a $15 softcover which contains the first 20 of those neat-o groups/leaders/monsters/situations. 3 villages, 5 groups, 4 leaders, 4 monsters, 3 specific situations). Either way, you get to access all the ongoing updates.<br/></blockquote>\nI'm working on a similar sort of idea, except I was planning on doing one pager releases (divided into 16 small pages).  Each page has complete rules, one character type, and six bestiary entries (generic fantasy stuff).  I hadn't thought about doing something web related for release... maybe have to try that next time.<br/><br/>The only trouble I see is the separation between consumption and execution, which is actually a problem that I see with rpgs in general (sort of responding to David Artman's thoughts).  If you have to read something independently of when it is used in a game, it will be less likely to be read in the first place (but it can be more complicated).<br/><br/>Maybe one of these solutions might work, to make reading serial game material immediate fun.<br/><br/>1. The content is entertaining in itself.  It has a section of flavor text or comic that's part of a parallel ongoing story-line, in tandem with rules and setting.

So maybe on Monday you've got an updated situation and folks have until Wednesday midnight (your time) to post in a forum as to what they'd do next--maybe even do that Karma thing where folks can vote for each other? Then, by Friday, you've update the situation, resolve the conflict, whatever, using the "Star Player's" solution or response. Then, Monday again, and you roll into a new situation that is a result of the solution (or a result of story advancement).<br/><br/>Somewhere between collaboration and actually running a game for the whole crowd. Focus on entertaining writing more than art (else it IS a web comic, not a "web comic model RPG") and providing situations that others can "lift" for their own games.
