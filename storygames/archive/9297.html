I know with the guys I play with regularly we're always looking for ways to increase the pressure on our own characters.  This occasionally takes the form of establishing adversity, reacting to it, and resolving it as an individual, which is what the Czege Principle will tell you leads to suck.  I get that, but in my experience it does not always lead to suck, and that's sort of interesting.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205877/#Comment_205877" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T04:38:01+00:00" title="May  7, 2009  4:38AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Example:  Monday night, in my Traveller one-shot, there's a tense scene where the useless naval officer is holed up in an armored car surrounded by an angry mob that is intent on hanging a member of the team outside.

When it is your turn, you frame a scene and ask others to participate and it is intended to be about your character's internal life somehow, his or her goals, dreams, fears, aspirations.  You declare positive and negative stakes, when outcome is uncertain you resolve it and narrate the outcome.  It's all about you and, in play, it works great when juxtaposed with mission scenes, which work in a more traditional way.  Personal scenes have a big impact on your character's arc throughout the game.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_205887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205887/#Comment_205887" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T05:06:33+00:00" title="May  7, 2009  5:06AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think we might have had a scene in Fiasco in which I put my character into danger and then had him killed.

And, at that point, you really need some buy-in from the player in question to know how far you can continue to push, right?<br/><br/>Say... um, we're playing Mouse Guard, I'm the GM, and your mouse has been kidnapped by weasels.  And they're going to be in the process of preparing to eat you when the other mice come to try and save you.  And I, the GM, am not quite sure how dark or gruesome I can make this scene without you feeling like I'm hosing your character or taking the story in a direction that you'll hate.  But maybe I really want the weasels to, like, eat your arm or something terrible like that, just to set the tone of the game and push your character into the spotlight more.<br/><br/>And this is a conflict, so theoretically I could just say, "Um, okay, if the weasels win, they eat your arm."  Or I could say, "If the weasels win, they eat you; you're dead," and then maybe, after the conflict, we compromise on them just eating your arm.  Or I could say, "Hmm, the weasels should do something terrible to you if they win..." and you pipe up with, "Yeah, like eat my arm or something."  And that seals the deal on the social contract, right?  Then I know that you're down with some pretty terrible stuff.<br/><br/>So while that example isn't really appropriate to the Czege Principle either, since you're not playing the weasels or whatever.  I think it points to something interesting on the edges of the Czege Principle that might potentially be appropriate.  And that's... sometimes (partially) authoring your own opposition is important to feel "safe" at the table, that you have some manner of control or at least final say in what happens to your character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205942">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205942/#Comment_205942" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T07:08:57+00:00" title="May  7, 2009  7:08AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 7, 2009 7:15AM by timfire.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, I haven't yet---sadly---played <i>Grey Ranks</i>. How does resolution work? You describe the player setting up both positive and negative stakes---this makes it sound like there's some sort of random element in there somewhere.<br/><br/>Personally, I like to describe the Czege principle as <i>"it's unfun to <b>all</b> a) establish your own adversity, b) decide what happens, and c) narrate the effects."</i> If in <i>Grey Ranks</i> you're letting the dice or another player decide what happens (b), then I don't consider that a breech of the Czege principle.<br/><br/>I'll also add that many times, what seems like a player creating their own adversity isn't. This specifically relates to Kickers in <i>Sorcerer</i> and Fates in tMW. In those games, the player is creating a general "topic" or "arena" of adversity, but the specific form of opposition is still generated, or at least controlled, by the GM (or whoever in other games). <i>[edit] Maybe another way to say it is that Kickers and Fates are a lot like highly defined Flags.

You fuckers type fast.</i><br/><br/>Okay, Verge, my cyberpunk game. It's been through a ton of incarnations. The first one actually had a character sheet and shit. But I digress. <br/><br/>In that first version, you got to roll a handful of d-sixes for your character. You also got to determine how many dice the GM got to roll. The greater the risk, the greater the potential reward. It was cool, conceptually. In play, it fell flat. With a few exceptions, players didn't like determining how risky something was.<br/><br/>In a later version, once character sheets went the way of the blue whale, and I sent the GM role packing, players were generating their own conflicts. They'd look at the network like a board game. They'd pick a node somewhere and "attack" it, roll dice to resolve it, then narrate what happens. All by oneself. That wasn't fun. Players wanted the give-and-take of another player involved there. I suspect it's Czege Principle stuff, or closely related.<br/><br/>This is all very different from situations where players complicate the lives of their characters. Making your character do something that intensifies his situation is not an example of the Czege Principle. If it were, pretty much all role-playing would be Czege Principle, and therefore would tend to the boring. <br/><br/>Sorcerer Kickers (chasing one's own character up a tree and throwing rocks at him at the start of play) manage to give players the power (okay, situational authority) to put their characters into a world of hurt, but Sorcerer puts development and resolution into the GM's hands. This avoids Czege Principle problems. <br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite><br/>How about personal scenes in Grey Ranks?  That's really what I've been thinking about.<br/><br/>(recap:  So everybody gets a personal scene in each chapter.  When it is your turn, you frame a scene and ask others to participate and it is intended to be about your character's internal life somehow, his or her goals, dreams, fears, aspirations.  You declare positive and negative stakes, when outcome is uncertain you resolve it and narrate the outcome.  It's all about you and, in play, it works great when juxtaposed with mission scenes, which work in a more traditional way.  Personal scenes have a big impact on your character's arc throughout the game.)</blockquote>\nI haven't played Grey Ranks yet (dammit), so I can only speak to the example. This feels a lot like the Confessional in Inspectres, but you're GMing it for other people. It's not a traditional conflict scene. I also suspect that the interplay with the other players, who know it's "your scene," creates a dynamic where you have one player and many GMs trying to make that scene more interesting. <br/><br/>If the other players turtle up, what happens to the scene? Since it's "all about you," I'd say it should be fine, in theory. I suspect this is not the case in practice, though. I suspect Czege Principle problems start creeping in. Do you have any data on that?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_205945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205945/#Comment_205945" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T07:12:02+00:00" title="May  7, 2009  7:12AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, OK Tim, there's a die roll in there n the Grey Ranks personal scenes.

If the entire game was structured that way, I bet it wouldn't, but because there's a sharp dichotomy between communal, outward-focused missions and solitary, inward-focused personal scenes, they seem to have a lot of narrative heft.  They end up serving a lot of different purposes - they let players flag stuff they care about in a big way, they give people space to refocus the narrative (sometimes important in an intense session), and they are creatively disruptive - you can throw them into the middle of other scenes, and this is just a great technique.  Despite all this I look at it and often have a nagging feeling it gives too much control to the player framing the scene.  That may be unfounded, and I'm not fixing something that isn't broken, anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205961/#Comment_205961" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T07:31:29+00:00" title="May  7, 2009  7:31AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 7, 2009 7:36AM by timfire.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=8726" rel="nofollow">this topic came up not too long ago</a>, and Eero made what I thought was <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=193033" rel="nofollow">a great observation</a>. He argued that the Czege principle is specifically related to what he called "advocation", which I am tempted to simply call "playing a role". The idea---as I understand it---is that when "playing a role" your task in the game is to pursue the interests of that "role". If you're forced to take over your own opposition, you're essentially stepping outside that "role", and that's why it doesn't feel right.<br/><br/>(OK, here's a little necessary theory---by "role", I actually mean "story role", rather than a specific character. So a player's role isn't really "Bob the barbarian", it's the protagonist. As a protagonist, the player actually has an interest in the type and intensity of the character's adversity, since overcoming that adversity is one of the big things that defines the protagonistic quality of the character. That's why something like a Kicker, or more generally just putting your own character in difficult situations, is still "fun".

I'll bet players do hose their own characters pretty badly sometimes. <br/><br/>I know in a number of games, narration rights after conflicts are apportioned in interesting ways. Verge separates who narrates from who wins, for example. In some cases, you might pick the smaller number of higher-ranked dice so you can narrate your own failure. This puts the choice into the player's hands, though, so they're not forced to do something they don't think is boring.<br/><br/>I'd like to see a mechanism that let players hurt their characters more after it was determined they lost.

It's like arguing about whether to grab dice with your right or left hand - who cares, we switch fluidly depending on where the dice are. It can be used as an aesthetic ritual thing, of course, like lighting candles, speaking code-phrases or narrating everything in the past tense. But overall, stance seems to me like something that is important to name only to be able to set it aside.<br/><br/>The Czege principle is closely related to the idea of "hurting your own character". What makes these discussions tricky is the divide identified by that advocation thing: on the one hand we have these games where you're "hurting your character" by asking/telling the GM to have something awful happen to him in the interests of playing fair and having an interesting story. But then you also have these games where you "hurt your character" by having the character act foolishly, humanely or otherwise in ways that you're fully aware will lead to awful consequences for him. The advocation model of narrativism pretty much tells us that while the latter is a routine and even integral part of interesting narrativistic gaming, the former is not - it's a conflict of interest to require the player to both advocate for his character and ascribe the consequences for his choices. That breaks down the advocation, which is what I think the Czege principle ultimately addresses: the choices your character makes do not have the zing of premise-resolution to them if the consequences, which are an integral part of theme-creation, are also ascribed by yourself only.<br/><br/>So that's one border of the Czege principle, but I'm not so sure it's the same one Jason has. Jason's first, abortive example is a fine case of how players can "introduce adversity" by having their characters act in stupid ways - it works, because representing your character honestly and with power is so important to a game like PTA that it overrides other concerns. Kaare's example is interesting as well, it's a different border, if it even is a border of the Czege principle: the issue of narration rights is about a trusty working relationship among the group - is Czege principle about that?<br/><br/>My own practical experience with the Czege principle falling hard is with <i>Contenders</i>. I've played it successfully, but that always seems to depend on internal drive from each of the players, there is no social dynamic that'd keep it going. One time we tried playing it and I just completely froze exactly because of this issue: I would have had to frame a scene, position my character towards a conflict, declare conflict, resolve conflict and narrate the resolution, all by myself. I just couldn't do it at that time, felt so pointless. Had to end the game at the first scene, practically. So that's an example of how the lack of advocation can ruin the experience for a player used to it: I couldn't orient myself to playing Contenders, because I had no external constraint for my character to make choices against: all constraints and consequences of his actions were controlled by myself, so I was just doing puppetry.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206009/#Comment_206009" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T08:57:15+00:00" title="May  7, 2009  8:57AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 7, 2009 9:20AM by Brand_Robins.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Cross posted with Eero and Emily) \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I don't really want to deconstruct anything.  What I really want to talk about is the dangerous edge of the Czege principle, and how it might be a place from which really interesting, fun play emerges.</blockquote>\nSo, back when this all started Paul was talking about Chalk Outlines (and partly a modified version of The Pool). The way he described how play went, and where it fell apart for him, was pretty much like this: <br/><br/>1) The player frames a scene in which they set up their own character's conflict<br/>2) Everyone plays in the scene, seemingly for as long as the framing player finds it interesting <br/>3) The player then decides which dice they roll, and rolls the dice<br/>4) The player then decides what the dice roll means and narrates it. <br/><br/>Which basically lead to a lot of problems of framing too close to conflict, solo play, lack of investment in each other's scenes (and even folks own scenes), and a general lack of "spark" where the game hit. <br/><br/>The thing about it, looking over that list, is that a lot of those are interesting ideas for ways to do things. The problem is that when they're all put together like that they result in virtual solo play. Where do other people's judgments of your character fit in? Others contributions to the scene? To the resolution? Where do you get that thing that turns the game from semi-joint daydreaming into an interesting game you're playing together? <br/><br/>Now, I have a feeling that the purpose of a lot of the stuff that was going on was to build investment and or that magical thing "protagonism." I think it may just be that it went to far. Putting together three of those elements might work, but all of them in a row kill tension and involvement as a group. <br/><br/>So maybe one of the places to look for the dangerous edge is to figure in how many ways can we get a person to deeply involve themselves in a conflict, to set up or resolve enough of the conflict that they are deeply emotionally committed, before we turn something over to the rest of the group to problematize, judge, randomize, or take away control. <br/><br/>Kaare's example is an interesting one here. In cases like that its pretty obvious that players will hose their own characters and do so with no "Czege violation" -- because they didn't control everything up to that point. The character lost as determined by the system and the input of the other players, so narrating the character getting genital tortured is fun (um....), because it involves a level of spark from both the system and someone else at the table. <br/><br/>My question is, would it still work if the player had framed the scene? If the player had framed the scene and set the consequences for the roll? If the player knew that he'd get narration win or lose, or only lose? <br/><br/>I think, in my history of play, that you can stack up several of those, but not all of them. If a character sets a conflict and narrates the resolution to the conflict, that's fine -- so long as in the stages in between someone (everyone) else at the table has a chance to substantively fuck it all up. And I don't mean "has a chance to add some fan mail" or "can make OOC comments" -- I mean has a real chance to change the outcome.

The story is being crafted to entertain and communicate to others, that's where the satisfaction comes from. <br/><br/>In rpg, though the back and forth between multiple players is crucial. (Well, generally, though there is the counter-example of solo play of a larp while locked in a closet--but even the closet is an external constraint, it at least implies the action of others.) It is also easy to lose energy if you are having to do it all yourself--that's what sounds like was happening, at least in part, in your example, Eero. <br/><br/>It may matter what the expectations are as well--I can imagine playing a solo game that you interact with to create and resolve conflict, but that is fun because you are prepared and ready to do it on your own. In a game that is supposed to point you at others, and promises tangles with what other folks have created, it is a let down to have to do it all on your own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206011/#Comment_206011" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T09:03:42+00:00" title="May  7, 2009  9:03AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 7, 2009 9:04AM by Emily_Care.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite><br/>I think, in my history of play, that you can stack up several of those, but not all of them.

Chris Claremont, X-Men writer, is notorious for having mind-control in his stories, even when, say, mind control already happened in the previous issue.  He can't get enough of it as a way to create interesting story stuff.  However, in roleplaying games, "mind control" tactics can be really deprotagonising.  Like when the GM says, "The monster appears and your character is really scared."  There, he's controlling your characters' thoughts or emotions, which is often no-fun and distancing.  So basically, the Claremont Principle was gonna be like: "There are both fun an unfun ways of influencing / hosing / antagonizing someone else's character."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206037">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206037/#Comment_206037" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T10:03:05+00:00" title="May  7, 2009 10:03AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks!

I got myself some learning from <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=21694.msg222607#msg222607" rel="nofollow">this Forge post</a> which cleared me right up.<br/><br/>So.  What's this all about?  It's about this sort of activity:<br/><br/>Player A gives monologue about his character.<br/>Player B gives monologue about her character.<br/>Player C gives monologue about his character.<br/>Repeat well past ad nauseum.<br/><br/>Czege specific complaint with this is that it's boring, which is a pretty personal response.  If the players are top-notch monologue-ists and everyone's in the mood to listen, it may or may not be boring.  But I think it's fair to say that the activity will be unsatisfying for people expecting to play an RPG.<br/><br/>As an aside, note how similar this appears to the "playing before playing" activity.<br/><br/>As far as being boring goes, it's probably fair to say that it is predictable.  Not for the listeners, necessarily, but for the player delivering the monologue.  Yes, there might be some sort of Fortune mechanic crammed in there somewhere, but that generally improves thing from a strictly linear narrative to a narrative with one branch point and two predictable outcomes.<br/><br/>The simplest contrasting activity I can think of right off the top of my head is the improv Say Again game.  It's easy to explain, so here it is:  Player A tells a story.  Any of the other players, at any time, can yell out "Say Again!" at which point whatever Player A just said didn't happen, and he needs to say something else.  So it looks something like:<br/><br/>"So I was driving my car to work one morning..."<br/>"Say again!"<br/>"So I was driving my car to a funeral one morning, and I picked up a hitchhiker along the way.  He was one of those scruffy, scary-looking guys..."<br/>"Say again!"<br/>"The hitchhiker was a beautiful blonde teenager in a too-tight Hooters shirt.  The first thing she asked me was..."<br/>et cetera, et cetera.<br/><br/>The fun of this is in the unpredictability, but I'd suggest that isn't quite enough.  I mean that it can be fun to play with something like Traveller's random lifepath generator all by one's lonesome, but that isn't enough in itself to be a full-blown RPG either.<br/><br/>So, where is the fun coming from?  I'm not too good to steal from Lajos Egri.  He wrote:<br/><br/>"In conflict we are forced to reveal ourselves. It seems that self-revelation of others or ourselves holds a fatal fascination for everyone. "<br/><br/>Ah.  Conflict.  Self-revelation.  That sounds like we're on the right track.  So I'd suggest the main problem with simple monologuing is that it contains insufficient self-revelation.  I'm relatively sure, but not entirely, that the important thing here is the self-revelation of the players, in contrast to the characters.<br/><br/>Fully-engaged play between two players reveals them both; the question is as revealing as the answer.  Unpredictability helps the players get down through the masks of ego and into their instincts, which is the interesting part of self-revelation.<br/><br/>So.  How will I judge my future play?  I will ask myself:  What did I learn about the other players?  What did I learn about myself?  Therein lies the value of it all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206721">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206721/#Comment_206721" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-11T11:43:19+00:00" title="May 11, 2009 11:43AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Character monogamy is the encumbrance rules of the future.</blockquote> We must have repeated this sentence a half-dozen times, like a cod-mantra, at the table on Friday when we played Fiasco.  For me, at least, it's becoming funny because it's becoming true.<br/><br/>From a metagame perspective, giving the other players a handle of some size on your character has the helpful effect that when you stall out, don't know how to continue, or are at a loss for ideas, the group can jump in and inspire you, and the rules sanction it. I feel like that addresses what Ron identified as the narrativist's complaint ("It bogs down!") so many moons ago, and does it more effectively than cutting out dice rolls, or abstracting conflict, ever has.<br/><br/>But, of course, what Jonathan says. It's a fine line to walk.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/raedwald" title="raedwald"><img alt="raedwald" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/raedwald">raedwald</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206964/#Comment_206964" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-12T14:56:20+00:00" title="May 12, 2009  2:56PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How about this.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) You outline a problem for your character.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) The GM or another player takes the outline, fleshes it out and/or complicates it, then serves it back to you.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) You solve the problem they have now given you.<br/>\n<br/>\nIsn't this what happens in any game where you can give your character flaws or disadvantages during character generation?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207020/#Comment_207020" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-13T01:01:38+00:00" title="May 13, 2009  1:01AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another data point, in a game of octaNe, Paula, my wife, was playing a kung fu monkey. He was looking for a map to the hide out of the Wasp Women (go-go dancers with beehives and yellow stripy costumes) who were out in the desert somewhere. He approached a bartender in Lost Vegas.<br/><br/>Paula won narration rights and had the monkey be forced to buy drinks to keep the bartender interested, he got so drunk, he got into a fight with his reflection behind the bar and was chucked out of the casino. For me, it was one of the high points of the game.<br/><br/>Characters also contain their opposites and there's fun to be had playing them too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
