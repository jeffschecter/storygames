Inspired by Jack Vance and Clark Ashton Smith, Wizards of the Three Moons lets you tell tales of the intrigues of the wizards who live amid the faded splendor of Ganymede, Titan, and Europa, as well as the adventures of their troupes of pawns. It uses a tarot deck and a bag of tokens to generate simple but provocative situations, challenges, and complications. <a href="https://www.distribly.com/product/8460?aid=1997&amp;aid=1997" rel="nofollow">Click here to pick up the PDF for just $5</a>.

In fact, some of the sketches contradict one another, and I don't even state categorically whether contradictions make something false. Also, the use of the tarot deck is not as a randomizer, the way that other games (including my previous game, House of Cards) do, but as an engine for adding narrative spice to conflict resolution. The cards prompt new narrative twists to be appended to nearly every conflict, which keeps the story moving forward with hooks for future development.<br/>- It can be played in a single afternoon,  but rewards return visits for the reasons mentioned above. Everyone wants to play both wizards in the framing scenes and their hapless pawns in the main scenes, so for everyone to get their time in the spotlight, long-term play is best, but it also lends itself to episodic one-offs.<br/>- I set the game in  a Numenera-like "future fantasy", and the invocation of Jack Vance's name is certainly not done lightly. After all, you sail between moons on ether balloons and solar caravels, and there are explicitly wizards right there in the name! I think if you can both enjoy a setting which is an anachronistic melange of pulpy sci-fi and medieval fantasy, then you'll be able to equally enjoy Wizards of the Three Moons.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ParadoxBoy" title="ParadoxBoy"><img alt="ParadoxBoy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ParadoxBoy">ParadoxBoy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475380/#Comment_475380" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-15T18:07:48+00:00" title="July 15, 2018  6:07PM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/10096/Parenthesis-Press/subcategory/25814_30252/Wizards-of-the-Three-Moons" rel="nofollow">The second edition of the game is now available in PDF and print at DriveThruRPG</a>, along with an accompanying Anthology Deck (a custom tarot deck designed to facilitate play).
