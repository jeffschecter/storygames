                    I'm running Best Friends at Dragonmeet and the organisers want a title for my game and a blurb.<br/><br/>The problem is, I don't know what the game will be about. The first thing I'll do is sit them down and ask what kind of game they want and what ages they want to play. So I can't even set a genre, because they'll decide that for themselves.<br/><br/>So how can I write a blurb that makes people want to play?<br/><br/>Graham                </div>

                            Best Friends is about a group of friends who know each other all too well. The characters are united by their friendship, of course, but also by envy, backstabbing, and the desire to one-up each other. Make sure the others get what they deserve and prove that best friends really are forever.                        </div>

                            Jonathan's summary pretty much nails it. You could maybe add some options to show its versatility.<br/><br/>Tangent: there are loads of cool possibilities for Best Friends hacks. I've been toying with two concepts, one of which is simply playing as the members of a rock band. Then there's the more involved mod of Special Relationship, which is about diplomats, where you stat based on your feeling towards the other player's countries.                        </div>

                            Also Graham, for convention games, it's no sin to tout a semi-imaginary session for games like Best Friends or PTA that illustrates the concept and makes them sexy:<br/><br/><i><b>Invasion of the Star Apes (PTA): </b> It's the television pilot you've always wanted!  The arrival of the Star Apes spelled the end for the comfortable world you knew - but it didn't spell the end of human ambition, lust, or cruelty!  Do a rag-tag band of circus trainers, zoo-keepers and scientists have the secret that will save the Earth - or will their issues tear them apart?</i><br/><br/>Then when the players arrive, you can say "We can do that - or something completely different and more fabulous.  Your choice."                        </div>

                            The thing is, although Jonathon's blurb describes the game accurately, it doesn't make me want to play it. It's not very grabby.<br/><br/>What I think I need is something which gives a hint of setting, but leaving things open:<br/><br/>"Perhaps the holiday wasn't such a good idea. You're stuck in a tent with four of your Best Friends: and, secretly, you hate all of them. Maybe they hate you too. And you're miles from anywhere. And is that wolves you can hear howling?"<br/><br/>Not <i>quite</i> that, but something like.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Jason, you're not advocating like a Bait-and-Switch, right? It's hard to tell with your last line about "We can do that - or something completely different and more fabulous"...<br/><br/>Graham: What I'd do is kinda like what Jason said in the first part: I tend to write game event descriptions for cons in two paragraphs or sections. The first pp or section is all about what the game itself will be about. Example from this upcoming MACE:
<blockquote><br/><b>Adventure Description:</b> A hidden village. A training ground and clan headquarters for a secretive ninja clan. Everything is going to change when a lone villager stumbles stumbles onto a piece of forbidden technology. The Shinto Priesthood will stop at nothing to recover the artifact, and will destroy anything that gets in its way.<br/><br/>A young elite paragon, troubled by nightmares; A jack-of-all trades who longs for fortune; A clan elder, his failing body enhanced by cybernetic implants; A soulgem-studded samurai-ninja who owes his life to the clan. These four must journey together to confront their personal fears as they set to return the artifact before everything they care about is engulfed in holy flame.<br/><br/>(SECTION ONE END. SECTION TWO BEGINS: )<br/><br/>This scenario introduces the Tenra Bansho system to 2-4 new players who have never played the game before. The game system, originally developed in Japan, is focused on character drama, play-acting, and action. The setting is like feudal "warring-states" era Japan, but thousands of years in the future, on another planet filled with high technology, magic, and unique people and creatures. No experience is required or expected to play, so come try out this "Hyper Oriental RPG"!</blockquote>
So, that second section actually came out lamer than I normally write, inasmuch as I blather a bit about the system, but I did want to plug a little what the game was about because the game title is just kinda out there.<br/><br/>Here's an old one I did a few years ago for a mecha game, condensing everything into one paragraph:
<blockquote>Mekkazombi: Infiltration - Hundreds of years in the future, the decadent Tenka-Yapon (Japanese) Empire has come to control a number of star systems through their advanced transport, mechanized infantry, and spiritual powers. The only rebels left holding them in check in this part of the galaxy are the Voodoun and Santia-using West Indies Hegemony from Earth. Powerful mecha and voodoo magic meet head to head in this adventure! Novices to the Big Eyes, Small Mouth rules are welcome.</blockquote>
Note how I don't really mention the system at all, although I do mention that it's a system open to all players. I think that this is important.<br/><br/>So yeah, pick a Setting. Pick some Scenario Seeds.  Make that what the adventure/session description is all about. Then at the very end just drop a single line saying something like "This session will be run using a rules-lite system called "Best Friends", a game about friendship and backstabbing. New players are welcome!"<br/><br/>Another great source of scenario descriptions is Rafael for his Dread games. Check this out:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.justusproductions.com/gaming/mace-prereg/mace-games-list.cfm?gamename=Dread" rel="nofollow">CLICK HERE for a list of Dread Events</a>.<br/><br/>Note that for all these scenarios, Rafael may have like, say, two sentences in mind for things that actually happen at the scenario.  Most of his scenarios seem to be shot straight from the hip, all improv, and based very loosely on the descriptions he submitted (IIRC, he writes the description sort of ad-hoc, his submit, and then only later thinks about the actual Content of the scenarios) but you really can't tell because he's that damn good of a horror GM. Note how it mentions Dread only at the bottom, almost as if in passing, and clearly makes the focus of the Cool Things that Happen in the Game.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Andy, it'd be a bait and switch if you couldn't actually run with the description you proposed.  If everybody shows up and is all "where are the fucking Star Apes?" then you can do that without breaking stride.  But you can give them the pitch and let them decide if they want a different show.                        </div>

                            Thanks very much for all the feedback. It's very useful.<br/><br/>Here's the latest draft. I've stolen lots of bits from what people suggested (Jason's idea of a default scenario, some of Gregor's description of the game and a bit of Andy's description of the PTA blurb).<br/><br/>So how does this read? Feel free to edit little bits you don't like.<br/><br/><b>The Mystery Of Black Rock Ridge</b><br/><br/><i>It's dark. You're miles from anywhere. You're camped on a craggy hill, with five of your best friends: but, secretly, you hate them all, and they hate you too. Is that wolves you can hear? Why the hell did you agree to this holiday? And when the chips are down, will you stick by your friends, or stick it to them?<br/><br/>The game is Best Friends, by Gregor Hutton: a game of girlfriends, jealousy and petty hatreds. It's also an infinitely customisable game, so bring ideas to the table: do you want to play Sex In The City or Mallory Towers? Horror or comedy? Grown-ups or kids? It's up to you and we'll decide as we play.</i><br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            That looks great and I'm totally stealing it as a future format.                        </div>
