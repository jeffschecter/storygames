Apparently Richard was turned on to RPGs (D&amp;D, etc.) by his son a few years ago, and according to my friend, he "talks about gaming with the giddiness of a teenager who has just discovered D&amp;D". Except he wants to make his game less about blowing things up and more about drama. He's also interested in game mechanics that might draw more from screenwriting techniques to become "more like collaborative storytelling."<br/><br/>Anyway, he gave my friend his email address and wants to talk game design with him.<br/><br/>So, did anyone pick this up? I didn't get a chance to look at my friend's copy too closely, and he lives many time zones away. It certainly sounds like Richard is trying to accomplish some of the things that storygames do really well, but he doesn't have much, if any, experience with the indie RPG scene. I think it might be worth while to have my friend direct him to the Forge, IPR, and possibly this site, but without seeing what he's already doing, I'd have a hard time suggesting meaningful specifics (other than "check out <b>Prime Time Adventures</b>, <b>Burning Empires</b>, and maybe <b>Shock</b>").<br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89472">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89472/#Comment_89472" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-22T09:52:16+00:00" title="August 22, 2007  9:52AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 22, 2007 9:52AM by J_Walton.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Somebody send that man Dogs, My Life With Master, Mountain Witch, Primetime Adventures, Shock:, Grey Ranks, and Sign in Stranger right now.  I think those do a fair job of representing the breadth of narrative structuring mechanics we've developed in indie games so far.  If I had to pick two, I'd send him Dogs (it's Mormon like Battlestar!) and Primetime Adventures (contains a lot of the screenwriting stuff he's talked about).  In fact, I'd suggest talking with Matt Wilson and Vincent and see if they'd be willing to donate PDF "review copies" to Hatch, since he's pretty likely to promote the games to bunches of other people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89485">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson" title="Ben_Johnson"><img alt="Ben_Johnson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2283/2131054135_2403ed15ce_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson">Ben_Johnson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89485/#Comment_89485" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-22T10:29:13+00:00" title="August 22, 2007 10:29AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Jonathan, while I totally agree with you in spirit, I don't want to load him up with a bunch of games (even really, really good ones), because that can be a little daunting. Besides, a big part of the indie RPG community is that most of the games can be played using a single slender volume, so I don't want to just throw the dude a fat stack of books and say "ZOMG!!! Read these!"<br/><br/>That's why I'm asking around to see if anybody has read this book, because if I'm going to recommend him anything specific, I want it to be something he might actually read. Ideally, one game. Maybe two or three. If he digs what he sees, he'll start looking for more on his own. Show the man the door, but let him walk through it by himself.<br/><br/>Think of it more like this: <br/><br/>There's this guy who's new to RPGs, but is trying to design his own because he loves them so much. He has interests in space opera and screenwriting. I think some storygaming concepts would match what he's trying to realize with his design. What game should I recommend he check out first?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89492">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89492/#Comment_89492" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-22T10:38:05+00:00" title="August 22, 2007 10:38AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Shadow of Yesterday has always struck me as a good crossover game/first story game.

I tried to find Richard Hatch and play my original series Battlestar Galactica ringtone, but I never saw him.<br/><br/>With that being said, I did not pick up the game.  I talked to a nice lady in the booth for a while, but it came down to buying Dawning Star: Helios Rising or Great War of Magellan and I went with the SG love.  I was also a little disappointed that the movie they were showing clips of is not even in preproduction.  Richard Hatch is trying to shop the series/movie with little luck and that made me leery of buying it.<br/><br/>I still might, though, because damn do I love me some BSG.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/woodelf" title="woodelf"><img alt="woodelf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/woodelf">woodelf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90646/#Comment_90646" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-27T08:32:57+00:00" title="August 27, 2007  8:32AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, i didn't buy it. But i did take the time to look at it fairly extensively. The game it most made me think of? Traveller. or maybe MegaTraveller. Lots of gear with detailed stats. Relatively complex mechanics and detailed Simulationist characters. I won't say there's *nothing* about personality or goals or passions in the character stats--i didn't look carefully enough--but i would be surprised to see something with any more mechanical influence than Ars Magica personality traits (i.e., static trait that gives a modest bonus/penalty to relevant rolls). I hemmed and hawed, and finally didn't buy it because, frankly, it pretty much looked like a scifi heartbreaker. The setting does look like it has some nice, original bits in it (i.e., the aliens are less cookie-cutter than Star Trek--no Hivers in there, but at least as original as the Sathar or Dralasites, on cursory examination). But the overall impression of the setting was "yet another space opera"--the names may have been different, but the same basic building blocks were there. Assortment of technology, from BSG to ST:TOS, and everything in between. Lots of aliens. FTL and lots of worlds. <br/>\n<br/>\nI may or may not be doing the setting justice--you can only get so much out of a ~300pp book in 10-15min of reading. Likewise, i may have missed some gems in the otherwise bog-standard traditional system. But i sorta doubt it. I almost bought it because Richard Hatch co-wrote it--for the novelty value, even though i'd determined it's almost certainly not for me. And, based on Ben Johnson's post, if Richard had still been around when i had time to stand around and yak (on Sunday), i probably would've bought it, just to support his enthusiasm, and because any critiques/suggestions would more likely be listened to from someone who had given the game a fair shot, than someone who passed on it. And it's not like i didn't already spend way too much money at Gen Con. Now i may have to see what i can do to track it down.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, to be perfectly clear: he may be incorporating all those literary/filmic/acting touches into how he plays RPGs, even Great War of Magellan. There might be extensive advice telling you to play the game that way. And that may even be possible. You can have story-oriented, thematic, and/or player-empowering play without the rules doing it--i did all of that, as well as or better than i can with Shock:, for years. Just as your character can have a personality, and that personality can be extremely influential on actual play, even if there are no mechanics for same; thematic, story-oriented play can be created through means other than the game mechanics. But, if you're looking for With Great Power\xe2\u20ac\xa6-style theme-is-defined-by-and-driven-by-the-mechanics play, i don't think Great War of Magellan is for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nShowing him something like PTA or With Great Power\xe2\u20ac\xa6 [i really think those two would probably be the two best to make the point--Shock: i suspect is too far removed from his experiences to click; DitV is probably somewhat less relevant to his interests, based on your description of the conversation (more about morality than story structure)] might be an epiphany. Or it might be sorta like my initial reaction to such games: "the story/theme is the *important* part; that's why i want the mechanics to keep their grubby mitts off of it--the mechanics are only allowed to interact with the unimportant stuff, like simulating the world. How could you mechanize the really important parts?"<br/>\n<br/>\nFor that matter, i'd also include Theatrix if it were still available. To see a very different route (from either Traveller or PTA) to the same goal. Story Engine is also, i've found, an excellent intro to these sorts of concepts [divorcing play from strict simulationist mechanics], but without all the theme stuff. Oh, a hybrid [of traditional and storygame styles] game would be another realistic possibility. That would pretty much be SotC, or maybe Burning Empires, though i think that (1) SotC is much more digestible, (2) SotC more clearly explains it's ideas, rather than just incorporating them into the rules, and (3) Burning Empires could just as easily be intimidating, as inspirational [the whole 'i could never do this good, so why bother?' thing].<br/>\n<br/>\nI really can't recommend Shock: to someone who isn't steeped in stories-driven-by-mechanics, because i still haven't figured out how to get from the mechanics to something like the opening example of play (despite the fact that i know how to get to something like that opening example of play using traditional Simulationist/Gamist RPGs, and using no mechanics whatsoever--and in both cases without railroading). It just doesn't provide much in the way of the tools to get from A to B. Unlike, say, PTA, which pretty explicitly spells out how the rules are used to create pieces, which in turn create the scenes that form the stories. It's possible that my background makes it harder for me to grok Shock:, but from dealing with others who (1) have much less indoctrination in RPGs, and (2) much more experience with literature and writing, it's not just me. There's a middle step that is apparently obvious to a lot of Forge folks, and completely unknown to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
