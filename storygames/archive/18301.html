Women and girl gamers often feel unwelcome in the boys club, and gamers can be clueless or dismissive of gender inequality. What are some successful ways to get women into gaming? What are some things to avoid? How can event organizers and game designers make women that show up more comfortable?</blockquote>\nApparently I had a thing or two to say about this topic.<br/><br/>UPDATE: The audio and post are back online.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412502/#Comment_412502" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-23T21:21:57+00:00" title="April 23, 2013  9:21PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm on shaped bandwidth right now.

This has been mentioned on these forums once or twice. It's been about six months since we started doing that. And I can report these two effects over that time frame:<br/><br/>-We have a nearly even split of male to female participants at out main events. There are usually one or two more males than females.<br/>-We have seen an increase in attendance from other gender minorities.<br/><br/>It seems to me that the Ladies' Night event (or something about it, anyway) we have has sent the message "hey, we are aware of these things and make an effort to consider the comfort level of all kinds of people" to more than just the women we were hoping to include.<br/><br/>Another potential factor is that in that same time frame we have also added in month jeepform events. Being that these things address very intense and mature subject matter, which also makes a kind of statement about the community and the people therein - especially to somebody who is on the outside looking in (we have never shied away from playing personal and intimate games at our regular story game meetup, either). <br/><br/>I'm not sure what anybody should do with that information. But it seems that, one way or another, our community has really grown in this department recently. I like to think that our efforts have made an impact, but who knows really. It's been really exciting, either way!<br/><br/>Tayler                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/3Jane" title="3Jane"><img alt="3Jane" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/3Jane">3Jane</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412516/#Comment_412516" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-24T04:15:24+00:00" title="April 24, 2013  4:15AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>In addition to the regular story game meetup events, we also do a Ladies' Night story game event.</blockquote>\nHow are Ladies' Night story game events different from normal story game meetup events?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/VALIS13" title="VALIS13"><img alt="VALIS13" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/505/nHOXUE6FO675U.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/VALIS13">VALIS13</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412522/#Comment_412522" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-24T06:22:00+00:00" title="April 24, 2013  6:22AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Gender inequality among gamers continues to be a frequent topic.

Most of the female gamers I know are easily able to cope with any boorish male behaviour they come across (sure, there is some), or are folks saying that they want to encourage specifically the more classically 'feminine' women into gaming (not that lots of current female gamers aren't feminine of course)?\n<blockquote><blockquote>In addition to the regular story game meetup events, we also do a Ladies' Night story game event.</blockquote>\nHow are Ladies' Night story game events different from normal story game meetup events?</blockquote>\nThe existence of a Ladies' Night at a con would make almost all of the female gamers of my acquaintance want to take a hammer to the building it was taking place in and not rest until there wasn't a brick left standing.

I'm not saying there isn't an issue. This is discrimination and yes, its also an issue here in <i>south</i> america too. But thinking of other people as "minorities", while is looked up as "being considerate" is actually part of the problem. When you say "minorities" you are still not thinking of other people as equal to you. You call them white, afro, women, etc. and treat them different, you can be more polite and treat them in a special way, but you're not solving the problem with that. You're just being "more considerate" at drawing a line to differentiate other people from "your people". You're calling them minorities and preaching they should get special treatment? Nonsense. You should be more like just treating them as equals and preaching against intolerance. When people want to play a game, we all become gamers. And that's it, there isn't such a thing as "women gamers who should be treated in an special way".

Guys simply do not, not at all in the amounts that women do. <br/>It's not just a "gaming problem", I'm sure this happens at cosplay events, computer conferences, SF convetions, etc (in fact, it does happen for each of those fields). We're not trying to fix "the world", just make our corner -- gaming -- better, if possible.<br/><br/>So "let's treat women as equals" is great. Everyone says this. But it's not happening, and women are having horrifying experiences. That's a fact, with lots of empirical evidence to back it up.<br/><br/>So, noted: "Let's treat women as equals". Great. I check that checkbox on the "page of solutions" and see what saying that gets us:  Huh, all of us saying "let's treat women as equals" appears to not fix issues of stalking, harassment, sexual assault/harassment, etc, all of which happen to women, almost exclusively.<br/><br/>It doesn't get us anywhere. At all.<br/><br/>So it's not a solution. So I cross this off the list. Then I look to this thread/linked discussion for more ideas. Perhaps one that is an Actual Solution, or at least does Anything At All. <br/><br/>Note: A solution that's happened at a game store in Japan (as Japan has these exact same issues, perhaps even moreso since its so much easier to stalk within a city) is that they've held "Women-only tabletop conventions", mini-cons to an audience of 20-40 women. They're reported to be extremely successful by attendees (comfortable, open, etc), despite getting criticism on the net (...from guys, who don't see the point). If there was no need for them, there wouldn't be more than 2 attendees. But there are many, and several instances of such conventions, proving that they do fill a need.<br/><br/>Also, a more (IMO) draconian thing that has gotten attendance at the "GenCon of Japan" is a "no photograph" policy. You are not allowed to take <b><i>any</i></b> pictures at the con: Not with a camera, cell-phone, etc. Of anything. Now, some people get permission at the tabletop to ONLY take pictures of the tabletop (maybe folks' hands) to show what game they ran, but even in those cases they take special care to not take pics of anyone's faces, even if the table is all men, because of that policy. "Stalker pics" is a huge issue at geek social gatherings, and that policy, while draconian, caused female participation to rise dramatically. <br/><br/>As Lisa said, when we have guys getting stalked and sexually harassed by women regularly, we'll revisit special consideration.<br/><br/>But for today, "Let's treat everyone equally" is a nice thing to say. But it doesn't solve a single thing. <br/><br/>EDIT: This isn't a specific dig on WarriorMonk: I don't mean offense to you.

I could go on, but I won't.<br/><br/>In my opinion, having some all-women gaming spaces is a really good idea. Not just because it is occasionally nice to play with lots of women, but also because it socializes women to one another and gives me the feeling of more social security. So if something goes wrong for me, I have people I feel I can go to for support.<br/><br/>One byproduct of living in a sexist culture is that often women don't feel empowered to take space for themselves, rather they have to be offered that space. I consider myself a strong person, but this is also true for me at times. The existence of a ladies' night (obviously, it depends on how it's floated) lets me know that the community is actively striving to include me, and that makes me more likely to take a chance on a new group.  <br/><br/>So yes, let's "treat women as equals," great! But I also think that people are complicated, and that simply telling them to do it isn't enough. We are also working against a pretty long cultural history of sexism, not just in gaming, but within most aspects of our culture. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412566/#Comment_412566" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-24T13:00:58+00:00" title="April 24, 2013  1:00PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 24, 2013 1:01PM by Ben_Robbins.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The original post and audio is offline right now because of technical difficulties but here's part of what I wrote after the panel:\n<blockquote>I don't talk a lot about why I set up Story Games Seattle the way I did.

Because women can come to our meetups and know their contribution is vital, that we want to hear what they have to say. Because <i>anyone</i> can come to our meetups and know that their contribution is vital because it really is.

But really that's my own fault for not explaining my reasons. They're seeing the negative, which is that they can't play the particular game they want at our events (or more specifically, GM the game they want to GM).<br/><br/>But they're missing the positive, which is that people are coming and enjoying role-playing games who might be or have been turned off by that strange player-GM power hierarchy that we veteran gamers don't even think about. They're missing that we're empowering droves of new people to play and enjoy role-playing games and revel in their own creativity and the <i>sheer fucking wonder</i> of creating things with others.<br/><br/>Yeah, there is some irony in being a tyrant who mandates equality.

Hm, I think there may be a cultural difference between the US and the UK  re: con gaming. More on that in a sec, but first:\n<blockquote>Andy, you've got me wrong. I'm not saying there isn't an issue.</blockquote>\nLikewise. Andy, I\u2019m just as concerned as most of the other folks on this forum are about practical and very real inequality, but there\u2019s a world of difference between things like unequal pay (still an issue here nearly 40 years after the Sex Discrimination Act of the late \u201870s), the lack of importance attached by many male-majority police departments to the murder of sex workers, the provision of video links in rape trials, the obscene practice whereby alleged rapists are allowed to subject their alleged victims to hours of harrowing cross-examination in court etc., and encouraging more women to play games. <br/><br/>Ok, to the apparent differences between the US and UK gaming scenes. I haven\u2019t asked all my female gamer acquaintances- of whom there are oodles, so yeah, maybe I\u2019m speaking from the position of the UK having a less unequal gender split- but I\u2019m pretty confident that almost none of them would come up with stories in any way similar to the frankly hair-raising ones that Lizzie Stark mentions; and these are in cons in major US cities, not downtown clubs in dark alleys? I\u2019m genuinely flabberghasted at these stories. I mean, you might find that sort of thing happening in a pub in a less than salubrious area of London, Manchester or Liverpool say, but in our equivalent of PAX East, Norwescon or Origins? It\u2019s unheard of. Sure, I\u2019m a man, so I may just have not heard about such incidents, but believe it or not I\u2019m very persuaded that I would have done. Please, women from the UK- and men- pitch in with data confirming my impression or otherwise.   \n<blockquote>catty_big: I have to say my own reaction, and that of other feminist gamers I know, would depend a LOT on how the Ladies' Night thing was framed. If it's "we want more women in the hobby/at our con and so we're going out of our way to make sure they get to play", that's awesome. If it's "okay, we've found a guy who's willing to run Blue Rose once a month because girls only like that romantic crap, right?" then I'd probably be angry or disgusted. It's all about context.</blockquote>\nAgain, maybe a difference between US and UK culture. Here, if a nightclub puts up a sign saying \u2018Ladies Night\u2019, or \u2018Women get in free on Tuesdays\u2019 etc., trust me, they\u2019re not trying to encourage more women to visit their establishments. Or rather, yes they are, but with a more nefarious intent, i.e. if you see a nightclub somewhere with that kind of offer heavily trailed, they\u2019re effectively inviting male visitors to attempt to take advantage of the female ones.

Do you live in a society that rewards women for talking about things that happen to them and usually takes their complaints seriously? Because I sure don't.<br/><br/>I would like to imagine that if you asked my female acquaintances whether I was the kind of person who takes these things seriously and they could talk to, I nonetheless have no expectation that they would tell me things because why would they trust me as a man? It takes hard work on my part to make sure the spaces that I have control of are welcoming and to send a message that their concerns are important to me, and I know that I'm fighting against a lot of cultural norms when I try to do those things.<br/><br/>If your first reaction to the subject is "oh that doesn't happen here" or "it doesn't seem like that big of a deal", as it seems to be, you are exactly the person who is not going to hear about it. Because if a woman has already had something shitty happen to her why would she go to someone who's not even going to believe it? Someone who she'll need to persuade to listen? Someone who she'll have to prove her story to?<br/><br/>ps: i'm not just talking about complaints or specific reports. Assuming you are generally a decent person and you hang out with women, why would they even mention bad shit that's happened to them in the past? Why would they spend the energy dredging up bad memories and burdening you with them? Unless you actively work for it you will never hear about these things. And sometimes, honestly, you shouldn't hear about them, because it's up to each person to decide how they want to react to their personal situation, and who they want to talk to about it. But of course it'd be better if they didn't have to at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412589/#Comment_412589" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-24T16:52:29+00:00" title="April 24, 2013  4:52PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really want to hear about successful inclusive strategies.

As a cosplayer, you get some horror stories (and experience a few yourself too even being a male) about some of the... I'd like to say less socially aware but sometimes just disgusting individuals. I think they are a side to most every hobby/interest, especially those that have been traditionally male. Heck, I have even heard some stories about casual sexism at professional scientific conventions.<br/>Its a problem. A lot of those that stay, I find, are almost all too aware of that side of the community and harden themselves against it. That isn't a response that should have to be made for an individual to enjoy an activity they are genuinely interested in. It really shocked me, actually, as both the RPG and anime backgrounds that I was introduced from were predominantly female theatre students.<br/>Ladies nights I believe can be a good initiative to attract those who have previously been turned away by that element but I think they can't stand up as a permanent solution of any kind as they do not address the main issue of male intolerance.<br/>Ultimately, the problem needs to be struck at the core, which may mean zero tolerance methods along the same lines as seen at Japanese conventions (I knew beforehand about Comiket's photo rulings but not other cons before Andy mentioned this. Some anime cons I have attended in the past have enforced quite rigidly a 'no touchy, always ask for pictures, always confirm poses' rule and that seems to have helped curb <i>some</i> of the issues). There does need to be a backlash from the reasonable gaming community. I know for the most part we like to try and be nice and accomodating to everyone, but lines have to be drawn at certain points and naming, shaming and calling out this kind of behaviour as unacceptable and unwanted is definitely one of the better long-term tactics. At the very least, it helps those affected not feel the isolation and shame that can often come with serious harassment.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412603/#Comment_412603" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-24T18:47:06+00:00" title="April 24, 2013  6:47PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The actual panel recording is back online, so anyone who has wanted to listen to it go forth:<br/><br/><b><a href="http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/512/norwescon-2013-women-in-gaming-communities/" rel="nofollow">Norwescon 2013: Women in Gaming Communities</a></b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412609/#Comment_412609" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-24T20:28:55+00:00" title="April 24, 2013  8:28PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Here, if a nightclub puts up a sign saying \u2018Ladies Night\u2019, or \u2018Women get in free on Tuesdays\u2019 etc., trust me, they\u2019re not trying to encourage more women to visit their establishments.

The strategies I liked most from the audio were:<br/><br/>1) Intervene and call people out when you see bad behavior, even when not directed at you (e.g. sexist or homophobic language and jokes).<br/><br/>2) Use a safe word (or maybe x-card) that will remove and rewind/fix an uncomfortable situation.  This is established at the beginning of a meetup or con, and once invoked it will not be questioned.  Simply rewind and do it again without the content that caused discomfort.  I've personally used the x-card in many of my games, which I think helped put new players at ease.  <br/><br/>3) Ladies' Night.  I haven't been, but it sounds like it's positive and doesn't exclude anyone.  <br/><br/>4) Encouraging game designers to make their games more inclusive.  There's been a lot of this type of encouragement on S-G, which I appreciate.

I experienced a distinct difference between gaming cultures in both countries. In Poland, harassment is normalised as "we're all friends, it's just a joke" (for example, this year at a con organisers apparently put up a handmade poster that said - in translation - "Show us your armband [admission badge] or show us your tits"). Some women protest; they get silenced by sarcasm, being called humourless extremists etc.<br/><br/>Conversely, in the UK, I never experienced anything but respect and support, whether I played or ran games (although my experience is limited to three years of going to Indiecon, Conception, Necrognomecon and local gaming clubs); in con games there were always female characters available and they weren't stereotyped. (Of course, that doesn't mean that harassment or problems don't exist in other venues; I just haven't experienced them). So it's believable to me that Leo (catty_big) never previously heard from local women about harassment; he wouldn't have heard about it from me at least (I met him at the conventions mentioned above).<br/><br/>I asked what a Ladies' Night event is like because I have the same associations as Leo does, above. For my own safety, I would avoid or be suspicious about events called "Ladies' Night" based on the name if I didn't know anything else about them, because night club "Ladies' Nights" where women are a commodity are the only kind I ever saw. However, the event described by quincunx clearly had great positive impact on the community, so I wanted to know what it consisted of, so that I could perhaps replicate it at some point <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Jane                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kaser" title="kaser"><img alt="kaser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/686/nMCJHMAE3CEJS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kaser">kaser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412650/#Comment_412650" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-25T09:13:15+00:00" title="April 25, 2013  9:13AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>I asked what a Ladies' Night event is...</blockquote>\nI haven't been, but I've heard good things.

I couldn't imagine participating in any event that was explicitly segregated like that - whether on gender, religious, ethnic or political grounds. Not at least here in Finland, anyway; I have explicitly refused membership in male-only organizations, even where their goals and values have otherwise been in accord with mine. I could imagine a society where some sorts of segregation could be a good idea; it would presumably be one where the current struggle for liberal equality had already been lost (or had not yet begun), so our stakes wouldn't be about equal and courteous social treatment of others anymore, but rather about where and how people are allowed to be themselves to begin with. I suppose it's one sort of equality, to divide people into separate and equally furnished rooms. Definitely a good idea if it's the only practical way for you to be yourself without harassment.<br/><br/>(The liberal approach to the issue of segregation is obviously to leave the choice to those who would be segregated. Thus, although it would make me sad to see that my community caused somebody to feel a need to segregate themselves, I would leave the choice to the people inside the box, rather than try to make the choice for them.)<br/><br/>In my own rpg circles the main strategy for inclusion has traditionally been social sensitivity to the comfort of the participants - making sure all are enjoying themselves, in other words. Where values clash, this causes a need to make choices, which I try to mediate in a mature way when problems are brought to my attention. Obviously this isn't an optimal way to deal with e.g. shy people who won't tell you if something's bothering them; with those you need to keep a sharper eye out and ask them about it if you're not sure about what's going on in their heads. And of course there's no magic reason in this universe for a given arbitrary group of people getting along: sometimes you have to drop out of a gaming group that's not serving your own creative or social needs.<br/><br/>Thinking about it, when women gamers have dropped out of gaming groups where I've been, my own inclination has been to interpret this as a creative difference: the game has been slow and heavily mechanical, for example, or hardcore challenge-based, and it hasn't been able to hold interest. At least I imagine that I'd recognize a legitimate creative difference, as I think that I've seen the same thing in reverse many times - male gamers dropping out because the game is too mechanical, or contrariwise because it's been all about relationship drama and not at all like D&amp;D. I used to let these situations go, but over the last five years I've adopted a policy of finding out from all drop-outs why they left the game. (The overwhelming reasons for all demographies have been a combination of scheduling, life changes and the game not being quite entertaining enough in comparison to alternative pastimes, incidentally. Useful knowledge still, as it helps you to figure out who to invite back for a new try later.)<br/><br/>When I've dealt with larger social circles, such as club or convention organization, and various projects outside gaming, my strategy has mostly been to scale my personal-level approach up. In practice this has meant encouraging people to speak up if they've got problems, interpersonal problems included. Anybody who thinks that this is a difficult way to solve the problem of female comfort in a male-dominated hobby has my agreement, but it seems to work over time, and it has the advantage of transforming the community given enough patience: as you communicate the message that this community does not accept e.g. sexual harassment, and complaints are dealt with in a just way that does not fall into dogmatism (both ignoring minority complaints and over-reacting to them causes problems, long-term), both onlookers and people being bullied gain courage to uphold social standards. I've also found that men take a passive equality strategy more positively than an active one: most Finnish men I've met are eager to participate in upholding a no-bullying, no-harassment policy, going as far as to police each other, while many would be confounded or suspicious over positive discrimination. That's probably a pretty normal situation - see my reaction to women only game-nights up top.<br/><br/>In the sort of conditions I usually work in, the above seems like a more appropriate strategy for raising the environmental humanism factor than e.g. segregation, although I imagine that the situation might be different in an environment that was less egalitarian to begin with. A lot depends on how the demographics fall out: if 80% of the men in the community are basically "good guys" and it's just a minority making a hobby of harassment, then you've got a different situation than in a more old-fashioned community where 80% of the men make a hobby of "chasing" or otherwise bullying women. In my local conditions, for my generation, my experience has been that the biggest question in dealing with sexual harassment has been due process and sense of maturity and scale (all real issues still, of course), not whether harassment is condoned.<br/><br/>I've been to a few American game conventions, and they're somewhat more male-dominant than the ones we have here in Finland. Considerably more sexist, also - chauvinist imagery and narrations are more prevalent in everything. Still, considering the people I've met, it seems to me that most are pretty okay, and probably just need some encouragement to uphold standards when they see bullying and harassment going on. It's possible that I've met a disproportionate number of humanist-leaning gamers in these contexts, of course. That would explain the degree of difference I see between the commercial sexual exploitation in the geek media, vs. the reasonably level-headed people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412664">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412664/#Comment_412664" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-25T11:10:05+00:00" title="April 25, 2013 11:10AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't get behind excluding people based on gender, race, religion, whatever.

It'd be great if this thread focused on tactics, cause we're all pretty smart and I'd love to come up with better plans for this stuff.<br/><br/>I'm a woman and I feel welcome in most gaming spaces. I think this is just based on my experience and my personality, though. I've also experienced outright bad behavior in many gaming spaces due to my gender. Many gaming spaces are not inclusive or welcoming to women. My experiences are just mine though, and I can't speak for all of my gender at all ever. <br/><br/>Objectively, gaming spaces are not inclusive toward women. Many women gamers write about it on the internet all the time. It's a real thing. There's a million reasons why it's problematic that google can tell you pretty quickly and easily. I want to find ways to welcome more women to my gaming spaces.<br/><br/>I like the idea of a Ladies Night, although the concept of a ladies night at bars is often "ladies get in free so guys can gawk at you!" I can see the easy association between the two names, but if it's a clever play on words and actually an all ladies night, that's pretty fun!<br/><br/><br/>Some tactics I'm working on that have worked for other event organizers and in adjacent fields un-inclusive toward women like tech:<br/><br/>1. Show the faces of the women in your organization. <br/>2. Reach out to women in the community and personally invite them (I learned this one from Lizzie Stark!)<br/>3. Recruit women from adjacent geeky interests (cosplay, fetish, video games, geeky knitting) <br/>3. Welcome new gamers, many women are not as entrenched in the gaming communities.<br/>4. Reduce antagonism toward feminine things in you games, at your events. Have feminine coded stuff around in addition to the masculine stuff that's usually around.<br/>5. Play games that are gender inclusive.<br/><br/><br/>I'm working on a post to put up on <a href="http://www.gamingaswomen.com/" rel="nofollow">Gaming as Women</a> actually, to talk more about this stuff.<br/><br/>It's really cool to hear success from a ladies night producing 50/50 gender representation! I've known some all ladies gaming groups to spring up recently... I was thinking of doing this locally too. Y'know, in all my free time. But it's actually kind of hard to find groups of women locally who are into this. I actually found a group in Columbus on meetups that's just for women geeks. I pitched some story games to my local fetish meetup on Tuesday and they loved Monsterhearts and Apocalypse World and Kagematsu. Stuff like that. I think it takes some legwork, and getting women and allies on board to make the effort to make the space inclusive. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412686/#Comment_412686" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-25T13:31:16+00:00" title="April 25, 2013  1:31PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>4. Reduce antagonism toward feminine things in you games, at your events.

A very important thing overall, both on small and large scales. The best tool in reducing gender difficulties is to teach people to get along in mixed-gender environments. In my experience most of the social problems of sexism seem to be fundamentally caused by people simply not having too much experience with interacting and being friends with the opposite gender. The root of humanism is empathy for the entire human experience, so ideally we'd all learn to enjoy less extremely genderized environments, where people can meet half-way comfortably.<br/><br/>(This is why you see over-sexed teenage boys and old people from the times of gender segregation having the most trouble dealing with people equitably. Geeks, too, insofar as they participate in a gendered subculture. They've all lived through the lop-sided experience of dealing mostly with their own gender in their social life.)<br/><br/>It also occurs to me, speaking of attitudes on the personal scale, that roleplaying has an amusing misogyny gauge built in in the form of actual role-playing. Is playing characters of the opposite gender a big deal in your group? Is the female experience and perspective involved at all in your art, even if you are male yourself? In my experience this mostly tends to be the case in all-male groups composed of people who individually don't have a very varied experience interacting with women. As I've grown older I've myself gotten into the habit of introducing female characters and viewpoints even in all-male games, just to provide variety and depth to the artistic endeavour. (As some might remember, I've recently been playing with teenagers a lot. I'd like to think that I've managed to teach them at least a little bit about treating their gender counterparts humanely. This has been most important in mixed-gender groups, of course.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412687/#Comment_412687" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-25T13:34:01+00:00" title="April 25, 2013  1:34PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, this is a cool article that was an interesting read to me: <a href="http://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/4291/3381" rel="nofollow">Free Culture and the Gender Gap</a><br/><br/><i>Despite the values of freedom and openness, the free culture movement\u2019s gender balance is as skewed (or more so) as that of the computing culture from which it arose. Based on the collection and analysis of discourse on gender and sexism within this movement over a six\u2013year period. I suggest three possible causes: (a) some geek identities can be narrow and unappealing; (b) open communities are especially susceptible to difficult people; and, (c) the ideas of freedom and openness can be used to dismiss concerns and rationalize the gender gap as a matter of preference and choice.</i><br/><br/>For all women spaces in gaming, check out <a href="http://www.rollespilsakademiet.dk/webshop/matbus2012.pdf" rel="nofollow">Mad About the Boy documentation</a>. On page 15, Lizzie articulates some great stuff about the controversy surrounding an all woman game:<br/><br/><i>Mad About the Boy is a game about women after all the men on earth die. So all the characters are women, save Thomas, the trans man, and Isak, the last biological man on earth, who showed up halfway through the game. In Norway, Trine, Margo, and Tor ran the game twice, once with an all-women cast, except for the last man, and once with a mixed-gender cast, all playing women. They felt that the first game focused on the game\u2019s intended topics\u2014power, sexuality, femininity, relationships between women\u2014while the second game ended up revolving more around cross-play. We decided to run an all-women game, and this caused all sorts of controversy.<br/><br/>Some people accused the game of sexism for excluding men. To me, this critique evidences a misunderstanding of what sexism is, which is gender bias enforced by a power structure that deferentially prefers one gender to another. I don\u2019t think running an all-women game is any more sexist than a girls\u2019 school, or a boys\u2019 school, and for the record, if someone wanted to run a larp for men only and had good reasons for doing so, I could get down with that. </i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamofpeace" title="Dreamofpeace"><img alt="Dreamofpeace" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/262/nTKQSP3YRT3C1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamofpeace">Dreamofpeace</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412689/#Comment_412689" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-25T13:52:52+00:00" title="April 25, 2013  1:52PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "... this critique evidences a misunderstanding of what sexism is, which is gender bias enforced by a power structure that deferentially prefers one gender to another."<br/><br/>  This is an overly narrow definition, IMHO, especially in this context, as most of the problematic behavior people have mentioned on this thread doesn't fit within this more sociological bent.

I actually think it ties in a lot with techniques utilized in gendered group therapy... relating to similar gendered experiences, issues, commonalities.<br/><br/>Maybe think of women's gaming spaces

I also agree with <a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">@WarriorMonk</a> when he writes that women should be treated as people, and not as something different. Don't invite women just because they are women. The word "invite" makes the impression that you bring "them" into your world. Have as a goal to <i>involve</i> both genders and let it be 50-50 at best.<br/><br/>Let me give an example. In Sweden, we got a gaming organisation called <a href="http://www.sverok.se/english/" rel="nofollow">Sverok</a>, which is the biggest organisation for youngsters in the country. It's founded by the government and is therefore able to enforce democracy and equality, no matter what gender, sexuality or ethnicity, This is spread to the 1000 gaming clubs and the larger conventions and gatherings in Sweden. Both Sverok and the conventions have front figures and they shift from year to year: some female, some male.<br/><br/>I had a quick look at GenCon. I don't know how the organisation works, but from what I could tell, it's run by a company ... with the same man as a front figure from year to year. What kind of signal does it send to never have a woman in a central position?<br/><br/>I think game designers should think about this too; to involve women in the design process. I tried to find a female artist for This Is Pulp, as an example. Also, create diversity among the roles in your games, not just a bunch of different males and one stereotypical/one-dimensional woman.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412698/#Comment_412698" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-25T14:48:10+00:00" title="April 25, 2013  2:48PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            AUDIO PROBLEMS: For anyone having trouble with the built-in audio player, I added link to download the MP3 directly.

Practically, as a man, I have a really hard time with intentionally all-male organizations. I will not join them; I won't participate in their activities.

I don't think an approach based on segregation will solve the deeper problems in the long run, but if (in this case) there are women who are happily gaming in women-only environments who would not be happily gaming otherwise, or women who are happily gaming in mixed environments who got their start only because of a women-only gaming environment, maybe that's more important right now than doing what I think would solve the deeper problem, especially as (horrors!)

We never have events that exclude people based on gender. Ever.<br/><br/>Some of our events are at 21 or over establishments and we generally don't expect kids because we're often dealing with adult themes but that's our only categorical exclusion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412725/#Comment_412725" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-25T19:07:46+00:00" title="April 25, 2013  7:07PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Maybe think of women's gaming spaces as ways to work toward including a gender that is excluded.</blockquote>\nIt's utterly baffling that people can't see that this is the point of women-only spaces.

(True story: I got kicked out of a Ladies' Night Out club, 'cos I got a separable prefix afore my womaness.) So I'll make this a bit easier--I'll just talk about my experience doing trans things in mixed and trans-only spaces.<br/><br/>There's a huge difference, which I think I can boil down to this: most trans folks get damn well-versed in trans stuff, but allies--even those with the best intentions--may or may not be on the same page. Which is all right and everything, but when you want to talk about your own things--the things that you probably share with a majority of other people like you, or at least share experience that will bridge some of the other differences--it can be very difficult to do so if you have to make sure everyone else can follow along.<br/><br/>And, yanno, since we're talking about sexism here, I don't think I'm being unfair by pointing out how difficult it is for women to keep an equitable share of the discussion space in mixed-gender groups. Nobody here needs that rehearsed, I hope. But--and you're getting this straight from the horse--it's really true. I and my now-needing-to-say-things-three-times-in-meetings-for-20%-less-than-I-used-to-make butt can attest to it.<br/><br/>I'll go back to trans stuff. Sometimes, you'll have issues, stuff that you share with your sisters &amp; brothers of trans experience? And sometimes that stuff is difficult or embarrassing or obscure to cis folk? And so in a mixed space you end up not getting to do that, while the folks who are privileged in the context of that space never need to worry about it? That's a real thing too. It's, like, happened to me and everything.<br/><br/>Ben, I'm a huge fan and I really appreciate you're taking a principled stand here, as stand I'm really in sympathy with and I know we turn away from with slippery slope dangers etc. But I kinda feel, <i>cui bono</i> here? I'm positive, based on what I see here, that you're doing a really, really good job with SGS. I'm also sure that it's not as good a job as you think, based on my experience of being one of those on the outside looking in. (And vice versa, but that's not as relevant as you might think.)<br/><br/>I guess, really, I'm just reacting to how opposed you seem to be to the idea of communities of choice coming together in their own space. I'm not 100% convinced that the stress of being a minority can be dispelled by the majority on their own. I'm also not really in favor of completely exclusionary groups. (See above. Do I contradict myself? I contain multiples, even after the psychic pruning.) But I'm definite that they can have their uses.<br/><br/>(Or hey, another true story: 'twas gaming at FLGS; me, another woman, three or four guys. Someone comes up, not a member of our group but a gamer in a shared community space. Asks questions about our game, how to join, etc. Then to me and the other woman:<br/><br/>"I guess you ladies are playing casters."<br/><br/>Me: "Combat focused bard. With a sideline in interrogation and torture."<br/><br/>Other Woman: "Bow-focused Ranger."<br/><br/>This a) never happened to me in the Previous Time and b) wouldn't have happened in a women-only space, where I'd have gotten the same consideration as any gamer, i.e. not having an archetype posited at me based on my body type. This probably wouldn't have happened with anybody here, I'm sure. But ask your female gamer friends. It's happened to them.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamofpeace" title="Dreamofpeace"><img alt="Dreamofpeace" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/262/nTKQSP3YRT3C1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamofpeace">Dreamofpeace</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412729/#Comment_412729" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-25T20:07:26+00:00" title="April 25, 2013  8:07PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            " I guess, really, I'm just reacting to how opposed you seem to be to the idea of communities of choice coming together in their own space."<br/><br/>I don't mean to speak for Ben, he's quite capable of doing that himself, but I think it would be helpful to make a couple of distinctions: (1) whether a community of minority-identified gamers can or should have the freedom to meet in a group composed of like individuals; (2) whether SGS (or any similar group) should hold events which exclude people on the basis of gender; (3) whether it's a good thing to be able to have groups that, for therapeutic purposes, are composed only of those people who have relevantly similar experiences; and (4) whether it's a helpful practice to have regular gaming groups that discriminate on the basis of gender.<br/><br/>IMHO, the answers to (1) and (3) are yes, and to (2) and (4), no.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CLMinou" title="CLMinou"><img alt="CLMinou" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CLMinou">CLMinou</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412734/#Comment_412734" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-25T22:02:09+00:00" title="April 25, 2013 10:02PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Dreamofpeace">@Dreamofpeace</a>: hey, absolutely.

I'm not sure that there's an understanding of the power that institutions--and yeah, SGS counts--can have in supporting things. That's one.<br/><br/>Another is that there are semantics. It's one thing to say, we don't discriminate. Very cool! It's another, though, to say to a group that experiences discrimination that hey, we won't support a, shall we say, <i>highly focused group with stringent entry requirements</i> because that's discrimination. I'm saying this badly. What I'm getting at is that when you imply that the group that is discriminated <i>against</i> is engaging in discrimination themselves because they may want separate space from the group--and I mean in the calling-Peter-of-Abelard Universalist Group, not necessarily any individuals--that discriminates against them, that's an odd message. It kind of puts the onus for discrimination off of the discriminators (in the larger context) and on the discriminatees.<br/><br/>It's not illogical or anything and like I said it's a principled stand and one I agree with--in principle. In actuality, enh. Not my region. But it's a vibe I got and it jarred me quite a bit, especially since I understand where Ben is coming from and I know he's an ally.<br/><br/>So if that's not the Seattle thing, okay. Other groups are experimenting with the idea, and it works for them, at least sometimes. Still other groups might find it's a disaster. Here in the Great American Metropolis, I have no idea what would work. We've got all sorts of things going on, and with 8.5 million folks, identities get really specialized. (Not sure about a dedicated story games group, although I am the hippie games mole in the SF Meetup's RPG night.)<br/><br/>I mean, if there's an interest, these kind of affinity groups will come into being no matter what. So the question is, do you want to help them along? Should they be under your aegis, or separate, or loosely affiliated or what have you? If you don't want to make something a strict SGS FemGameFest, then to what degree are you willing to support outreach to women gamers to help them come together under the larger umbrella? Etc. et al., YMMV, consult your physician. I ain't got the answers; my couch is 3K miles away.<br/><br/>Now, if I were cruel, I might note something about being told "you're doing it wrong" is one reason it's hard for women to break into all sorts of areas, beyond geekery even. (Check the well-described phenomenon of any job being devalued in esteem and compensation as soon as women make up a significant portion of its workforce; secretary used to be an executive position, 'pon a time.) Fortunately I'm not cruel, just German and passive-aggressive.<br/><br/>Anyway, I believe we were discussing ways to get more women in games? I'm for it; I tried like the devil to recruit another woman for my Trail of Cthulhu game, but no dice.

Maybe a buzzer that summons an organizer, with the expectation that the organizer isn't going to lay down the law, but rather simply support the idea that the "X card" is valid and the issues are relevant?

I'm the gaming panel designer at Norwescon, and I've also been running a monthly Ladies' Gaming Night here in Seattle. I used to be one of those women that was staunchly against women-specific gaming events, but I've recently come around. <br/><br/>I <i>don't</i> think a women's gaming night is "necessary" for women to feel safe, but I do think it's a lot of fun. I wrote up my recent Pathfinder event on<a href="http:/http://www.koboldpress.com/k/front-page15633.php#.UXoe0iqF9lv" rel="nofollow"> Kobold Press</a>, with a little background on how I run the event. I'm planning a special Ladies Story Games night with some of the regulars at Seattle Story Games. <br/><br/>I agree with Ben and the other posters that people should never be excluded based on gender, period, at least not for public events. I go out of my way to welcome anyone who is supportive of queer women to come game with us. My goal is to bring the gaming community as a whole closer together, and I don't think segregation will do that. As someone who has many feminist male friends and an amazing boyfriend, I also resent the idea that being a man automatically makes a person's opinion on these issues invalid. Yes, as women we have a different and likely closer perspective on these issues, but being a man does not exclude someone from being a feminist or having smart ideas. Nor does being a women preclude someone from sexism, either against their own gender or others. <br/><br/>As far as the panel recording goes, we unfortunately got a bit off track, and didn't discuss much that I put in the description. However I'm enjoying reading the discussion in this thread!                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamofpeace" title="Dreamofpeace"><img alt="Dreamofpeace" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/262/nTKQSP3YRT3C1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamofpeace">Dreamofpeace</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412745/#Comment_412745" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-25T23:51:55+00:00" title="April 25, 2013 11:51PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 25, 2013 11:59PM by Dreamofpeace.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/CLMinou">@CLMinou</a>,<br/><br/>Sure I never meant to imply malign motives on anyone's part, we're all trying to struggle effectively with quite a thorny issue, and it sounds like we all have the same goal in mind.\n<blockquote>But I do want to just make sure that some stuff gets heard.

If someone wanted to start another gaming meetup with, to pick more neutral language, more "restrictive" membership, nothing at all is stopping them.  SGS also focuses on GMless games, but is hardly a threat to people meeting in other groups to play D&amp;D.  \n<blockquote>Another is that there are semantics.

Also I want to make it clear that, from what I've seen, SGS does not discriminate, so it's hard for me to follow the part when you say "they may want separate space from the group... that discriminates against them".  The only semi-critical thing I have to say about the group is that my first one or times coming (a few months ago) I felt a certain "I don't trust the newbie" vibe from a few folks, but I was pretty sure it had nothing to do with my ethnicity.  Certainly the last game I played there everyone was very welcoming.  But that's tangential (except that, perhaps sometimes when someone feels uncomfortable it may be the "we're afraid of the newbie" thing rather than something else; just something to keep in mind I guess, when the cause isn't obvious).  But I may just not be getting what you're trying to say here...\n<blockquote>I mean, if there's an interest, these kind of affinity groups will come into being no matter what.

But my thought is, I think this is maybe best asked as part of the larger question of "how do we best encourage more people to try gaming, and ensure women feel included?"  The problem I always have with a question like "how do we do outreach to women gamers?" is that it appears to assume that all potential women gamers are alike and will want or be attracted to the same thing <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  The women gamers I know are quite different from each other and prefer radically different games, like playing very different characters and prefer different genres.  Other than the obvious things like include examples of diverse women characters in game books, use diverse gender language, mention that women are always welcome to our sessions and many regularly attend, etc. and in general be inclusive and welcoming of all, I personally don't know how to support outreach to women gamers.  But I am certainly willing to listen to ideas from wiser heads and lend my support to worthy efforts.<br/>\n<blockquote>Anyway, I believe we were discussing ways to get more women in games?

I would have loved to take part in it. As for women-only (or women-majority) events - it's such a relief to finally find oneself one of the "normal", majority participants, rather than the odd one out who is "weird" and singled out just by the virtue of being who they are. Honestly, I think many people who aren't the odd one out in their chosen environment which they identify themselves with - in this case, male gamers - will have a very hard time getting why it's valuable: having a place where one doesn't have to preemptively steel themselves for explanations, correcting well meant but hurtful mistakes, risking being rejected as 'spoilsport' when you raise objections, <a href="http://xkcd.com/385/" rel="nofollow">having to be perfect because your actions are interpreted as representative of your minority group</a>, etc. I never realised how much of a difference it made until I visited Glastonbury, where (among other things) there were many more Pagan than Christian shop fronts around, and ooooooooooohhhh that was such a relief because suddenly I no longer felt like a freak that was tolerated but never truly welcome.<br/><br/>EDIT: oh hey, looks like nasty things can happen (to women in RPGs) in the UK too: <a href="http://ukroleplayers.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=25&amp;t=15376&amp;start=15#p165034" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://ukroleplayers.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=25&amp;t=15376&amp;start=15#p165034</a> <img alt=":/" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/confused.png" title=":/"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412754/#Comment_412754" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-26T02:46:49+00:00" title="April 26, 2013  2:46AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 26, 2013 5:28AM by Rickard.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I will gather some of the suggested solutions on one place.\n<blockquote>1.

During a convention or major gathering, have every staff understand how to handle sexual harassment. I myself would feel hesitant how I should go through with a complaint of sexual harassment. Perhaps have one person in charge if that happens. Also, discuss after the convention how much complaints that occurred during the convention, and how it was handled.<br/><br/>1b. Draw up some guidelines to treat everyone with respect, for the visitors to read up on in folders, at the homepage et c. Discuss after the conventions if the guidelines needs to be changed.<br/><br/>2. Sometimes have a majority of women that organize the conventions. This is important because it can bring the feeling of "I can also do that" for other women. It can also create a feeling of safety and avoid alienation to see other women.<br/><br/>3. Create a mentoring for newcomers for the first year, and strive to have a women mentor another woman. There are a lot of thresholds to overcome if you're feeling like a minority and have to make your way through a new territory, and another woman can guide you to avoid her own pitfalls.  The mentor can also hook the newbie up with connections and act like a safety net. Critique, as an example, is made to the mentor and not the newcomer.<br/><br/>4. Putting both genders in leading roles at conventions for the same reason as in point 2.<br/><br/>[edit] 5. Have as a general guideline to always ask a women first for a role, up until there are almost 50-50 balance. I myself know how easy it is to ask friends first, or follow old tracks and involving the same dude year after year. It's sometimes not enough to be open and inclusive in mind.

It doesn't matter, then, if your big gaming meetup is full of awesome, cool, not creepy folks because a bad experience like that is unlikely to make them want to come back ever.<br/>But with a Ladies Night, they can meet up and game without that pressure or downside, grab some confidence and faith in the community from the women who attend both sets of events and can thereby be encouraged to move in to a mixed gender make up. At the same time, we employ the tactics mentioned above at mixed gender events in order to ensure that the environment they return to is one that isn't toxic.<br/>More importantly, if they don't have anyone to game with and won't go to a multi-gender meet up due to bad experiences, they won't game at all and that is just the worst.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412768/#Comment_412768" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-26T07:10:16+00:00" title="April 26, 2013  7:10AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Probably a part of the reason for looking strangely at a women-only event like that is that in addition to Ladies' Nights at pubs there is another context that is women-only: conservative religious groups that practice gender segregation. Anybody whose primary experience with gender segregation is in that context is unlikely to jump in joy at the idea, unless they themselves like the idea of putting women away so they can't go on enticing lust in the real people.<br/><br/>This is a tricky issue at least here in Finland, as we're getting used to multicultural situations. We might have a women's time block at a exercise gym with no religious overtones at all (such as they do at my home town right now), but then the local swimming pool might also start a women's block explicitly advertised at Muslim immigrants. The difficult part of the cultural discourse comes in when we've needed to make decisions/guesses about the motivations behind these types of developments: is the amount of gender segregation on the rise because affirmative action helps claim public spaces more equally, or because women are being forced by subtle or not so subtle social pressures to keep out of the public. Would it help if the community forbid immigrant segregation practices as contrary to local egalitarian traditions? Who would be helped by e.g. refusing to have girls only swimming classes, which would then ensure that immigrant muslim girls would not learn to swim at all? (I pinpoint immigrant muslims here because the home-grown variety of Christian fundamentalists in Finland are relatively egalitarian in comparison; they might forbid watching television and dating, but at least they forbid it to both sexes.)<br/><br/>As I said upthread, I personally think that if anybody wants to segregate by their own will, then by all means; privacy is an understandable value, and it's not a loss for me personally.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412769/#Comment_412769" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-26T07:57:11+00:00" title="April 26, 2013  7:57AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>Maybe think of women's gaming spaces as ways to work toward including a gender that is excluded.</blockquote>\nIt's utterly baffling that people can't see that this is the point of women-only spaces.  </blockquote>\nI don't think that's what's going on; some of us question whether this is a good strategy for that goal.

Women's space is not about "all men (or at least all male gamers)" being "somehow tainted and untrustworthy." <br/><br/>Women's space actually isn't about men at all. It's about women wanting to hang out with other women and build relationships, both for the sake of building relationships, and because such relations may help sustain them in mixed gender situations that may rarely -- god forbid -- turn hostile. And if that hurts the feelings of some men, that's too bad. Certainly, no one is proposing that gaming only be performed within single-gender groups, only that it's sometimes nice to game with people who have the same gender. An occasional ladies' night does not create a hostile atmosphere toward mixed gender gaming, which is by far the norm in our culture. <br/><br/>Let me repeat: even if there are ten times as many ladies' nights as currently exist, mixed gender gaming isn't going anywhere. I know tons of dudes that I love to game with, even though occasionally I like to game in a single-gender group. It's sort of like enjoying both chocolate and vanilla ice cream at different sittings, or the way I like to hang out with my journalist friends some times, and my fiction writing friends separately. Doesn't say anything about the virtues of one group over another -- they're just two different experiences that I happen to enjoy.<br/><br/>I don't think that there is a "fundamental moral problem" with women exercising their right to freely meet up in groups to hang out. I think there's a "fundamental moral problem" when a community views women meeting up together and talking as a dangerous exclusionary practice that must be stopped.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412793">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamofpeace" title="Dreamofpeace"><img alt="Dreamofpeace" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/262/nTKQSP3YRT3C1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamofpeace">Dreamofpeace</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412793/#Comment_412793" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-26T14:15:50+00:00" title="April 26, 2013  2:15PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We'll have to agree to disagree, Lizziestark.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412797/#Comment_412797" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-26T14:39:31+00:00" title="April 26, 2013  2:39PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Women's space actually isn't about men at all.</blockquote>\nSo very, very true.

I dislike gender dichotomies to begin with, and am thoroughly queer, and if I'm a woman and I think it's womanly what makes it not womanly, and all that. BUT. There are cultural signifiers. This idea came from Sweden actually, when they were running a game event and added pink cat ears as giveaways at their tables (along with other gaming stuff I can't remember what). I mean, that's feminine. And she said everybody loved them, but basically, because they were coded as feminine, it said "women are welcome here in this space". I"m still not sure how I feel about this one to be perfectly honest, but I like the idea of having images/objects around that are gender neutral, or gender inclusive, right?<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/CLMinou">@CLMinou</a> thanks for sharing your non-cis perspective!

I really agree with what I marked in bold above, and I can't deny the fact that uniform groups and mixed gender groups behaves differently. But from my experience, the only difference with having women in the group or playing with a all-women (except me) group is that the smell of fart is lacking compared to an all-male group. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Otherwise, it's just different when it comes the the gaming itself, no matter how balanced or unbalanced the group is when it comes to gender. [edit] But what you meant was that you enjoyed the different ways of interaction, right?<br/><br/>Why I asked the questions is because I've seen examples where guys think Vampire is a girls game (whatever that is), hearing one guy writing on a forum on how he didn't want girls in his gaming group because he didn't want to hear about lipstick and makeup, and in <a href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">@Ben_Robbins</a> pod there's an example of one guy interrogating a woman with obscure facts about the hobby to see if she could play with "the big boys". Those kinds of behaviours comes from people thinking that female and male gaming is different, and that kind of thinking is really foreign to me.<br/><br/>When it comes to mixed gender groups communicating differently, I recently read an essay called <i>Some Effects of Proportions on Group Life: Skewed Sex Ratios and Responses to Token Women</i> (Rosabeth Moss Kanter, 1977, <a href="http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2777808?uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21102102963701" rel="nofollow">link</a>). What I learned was that only in balanced groups (60:40 down to 50:50), the communication was free from sexist jokes and similar things compared to when there was no or few women in a group of men (up to perhaps 85:15 in ratio). The really interesting thing is that when the ratio was between 85:15 and 60:40, the group had <i>more</i> sexist jokes (because of initiation rites - but that's another story). Why am I'm writing this? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Because I acknowledge that the interaction is different but I would like to claim, according to my experience, that the gaming experience as a whole isn't <i>more </i>different, if I play with a new group consisting of only women than a group of only men. Like you said, different people provides different experiences. Not gender.

Discrimination is a Loaded Term (note to self: good name for a game) and folks should really pause before they use it, <i>especially</i> when they make comparisons between groups with unequal privilege and do the kind of substitution that Dreamofpeace did above. 'Cos it's not the same. Seriously, if anyone is in a position to talk about it, it's this gal (mentally picture me pointing thumbs at myself.)<br/><br/>I mean, I'm just a hacky GM who wants her games to be more narrative focused. I make no claims about my game design abilities. But <i>le feminisme</i>, hey, that's something more in my bag. And if <i>system matters</i>, well, <i>semantics matter</i> too.<br/><br/>What I've seen happening in this thread--and apply all standard caveats about my own filters etc.--is that a serious, good faith question was asked. Some woman-identified people chimed in, and discussed a particular tactic employed by other SG groups. This suggestion got fairly brusquely knocked down. Some more woman-identified people tried to bring their own experience and feelings about the matter, and some apparently male-identified people continued to not even acknowledge that they might have a claim at least to their own experiences.<br/><br/>At which point everybody starts to get shirty and a few of us on both sides dig in our heels. And the next thing you know, instead of talking about ways to improve inclusion and welcome more women--which, yanno, has been <i>acknowledged to be a concern, even at SGS or we wouldn't be having this talk</i>, is now revolving around the utility of affinity groups composed of a single less privileged class, and oh yeah my all time favorite "now YOU'RE committing discrimination" argument which is something I've NEVER encountered in my wanderings across these here Interwebs.<br/><br/>Or shorter (impossible! CL read too much Faulkner as a kid and now she has logorrhea!): if you're a feminist identified person, and especially a feminist identified woman, you've heard all this before and you're hearing it AGAIN, once again in an area where you really are trying to fit in, and it makes you want to throw in the towel and get an XBox.<br/><br/>Well, maybe not the XBox part; I suck at videogames.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's where I'm sitting. Rickard had some good ideas. I'll try to have something more constructive myself, after I finish working on my necromancer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamofpeace" title="Dreamofpeace"><img alt="Dreamofpeace" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/262/nTKQSP3YRT3C1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamofpeace">Dreamofpeace</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412826/#Comment_412826" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-26T20:27:48+00:00" title="April 26, 2013  8:27PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there are a few issues some of us just aren't going to agree on.

Interesting topic. Look at all the views; all the lurkers like myself who follow but don't chime in... oops.<br/><br/>How to improve the situation? What to do? What to do?<br/><br/>My first thought was: would an all female group be comfortable with a gay man at the table? Then: what about a lesbian? THEN!: what about an Asian? Then what about a transgender Jewish African in a wheelchair? <br/><br/>Whoah, way off topic! Or is it? What if the all-female group was uncomfortable with another (un)identifiable group? Is that okay? Is there a gaming table reserved for Anti-semite Homophobe females? Okay, I pushed the Sarcasm button once too many times.<br/><br/>Here's my suggestion: make a gaming environment that is open to EVERYONE! And I mean clearly. Advertise that men, women, gay, lesbian, transgender, non-cis (I'm not sure if I'm using that right; I'm a little more Kirk than Picard), black, white, purple, green, disabled, differently abled, cape-abled, short, tall, fat, thin, stars-on-thars or not. Don't even disclude the bigots; they'll disclude themselves ("Dude, you didn't go to RainbowCon, did you?" "What, me? No way!").<br/><br/>When a couple of strong, burly gamers help the wheel-chair-bound post-op trans-sexual black Mormon into the gaming convention, THEN we can stop discussing this. But not a moment before.<br/><br/><br/>On a personal note, I will predict here and now for future generations to record: there will be a third public bathroom. It's symbol will be Mercury (as in mercurial; changing) and it will initially be frequented by everyone because it is the cleanest.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412833/#Comment_412833" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-26T21:33:56+00:00" title="April 26, 2013  9:33PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>Here's my suggestion: make a gaming environment that is open to EVERYONE!

My response here is long overdue, and there is no way I am going to respond at every point that I might.<br/><br/>But real quick, a little bit of background on me for some context. I am a self-identified feminist and a clinical social worker in the field of domestic violence. Most of that I do revolves around our addressing our client's distorted beliefs concerning gender and personhood. These issues are very close to my heart, and I am reasonably well educated on these concepts. <br/><br/>There are some serious problems with some of the statements that I read again and again in this thread. These show a deep misunderstanding of equality, equity and gender bias, and an unawareness of privilege issues.<br/><br/>In America, gender bias is a real thing. It may not be quite the same in other cultures. I don't know and I'm not going to comment on that. I don't know what's up  in other places and none of this is intended to  examine those cultures.<br/><br/>Consider this. What does a man need to do/think about in order to not be sexually assaulted or harassed on a daily basis? That is, when you walk out the door, what do you have to do? For the overwhelming majority of American men, the answer is \u201cpretty much nuthin'.\u201d<br/><br/>What does a woman need to do/think about in order to not be sexually assaulted? <br/>-Consider where she is going<br/>-Consider when she will be there<br/>-Consider what she will wear<br/>-Consider who she will be going with<br/>-Not go alone<br/>-Mace<br/>-Phone<br/>-Keys in between the fingers<br/>-Rape whistle<br/>-Consider where she will park<br/>-Walk only in well lit areas<br/>-Let somebody know where she will be<br/>-Be wary of strangers, and especially groups of strangers<br/>-Tolerate verbal harassment <br/>-Tolerate unwanted advances<br/>-Tolerate being looked at in a sexual way<br/>-Tolerate stereotyping<br/>-Or, endure the reaction for NOT tolerating any of those things<br/><br/>And this is just a quick and dirty list. Granted, many men do some of these things anyway, but many men also feel these considerations are optional. Many women feel they are necessary on a daily basis. What it takes for a woman in this culture to go out to any given thing is very different for what it takes for a man to go out and do the same thing. No matter how much you put on paper \u201cEverybody is equally welcome here!\u201d that does not change anything about what it takes for different genders to just leave the house and put yourself out there.<br/><br/>And this is before you even factor in the odd brand of misogyny that runs in geek cultures. And before you factor in the prior negative experiences that many women have had in tabletop gaming in the first place.<br/><br/>(And not to mention people outside the gender binary. This is an issue I need to understand better, and I am glad that there are people in my community who are sensitive to those issues.)<br/><br/>So, the question is, what would a woman need in order to feel as though they do not have to overcome the obstacles that men don't have to overcome? This Ladies' Night business is one possible solution to this issue (and remember, the most important person you need to consider is the one who isn't coming to events) because it removes some of that problematic dynamic. <br/><br/>This line about \u201cdiscriminating against men\u201d does not acknowledge equity. Nor does it acknowledge the privilege males benefit from because they don't even have to think about those things, much less act differently because of them. If fact, being able to ignore the equity of a given situation is a part of that privilege (and it shows a lack on empathy for the experiences that American women endure every day). That, and men have an event for them and their needs. It's called pretty much every event ever.<br/><br/>This sexual assault question is a dramatic kind of example, but I use it because it is really clear. The gender bias and other dynamics work in more subtle ways too, but they are still pervasive. And it is still oppression even though it's widely accepted as \u201cit's just the way things are.\u201d<br/><br/>I am troubled and concerned that a community organizer in a major American city could be so deeply oblivious to matters of privilege and equity. And to throw out this business about their version of \u201cequality\u201d all the while. You have an obligation to your community to do better. <br/><br/>Love, <br/>Tayler                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/quincunx" title="quincunx"><img alt="quincunx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/quincunx">quincunx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412840/#Comment_412840" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-27T00:42:36+00:00" title="April 27, 2013 12:42AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alright, about the event itself.<br/><br/>First of all, I've directed the people who have actually run this event to this thread. No telling if they will pipe up, but keep in mind that I can only report what I have observed, or what has been told to me by attendees. The only time I've been was to drop off materials, and when I was invited to hang after an event.<br/><br/>It takes place outside of game stores because there seem to be fewer social questions about what experience you can expect. At a game store you experience is highly dependent on the game you play, where as in a bar &amp; bistro, you can at least get some food and a drink. <br/><br/>Also, the way the event is run is very social. It opens up with just hanging out and talking, and the games are super laid back. Like, improvised facilitation a lot of the time. Which means that the priority is everybody having a good time, not playing a game. Fewer social questions there too.<br/><br/>The primary demographic attending this event are females who were already aware of the other events in town, but never managed to muster up the will to go. File that data point away \u2013 there is a  (probably significant) demographic of people who are aware and informed about whats going on, but have not attended. Obviously, the claims to equality and safety did not cut it for these people.<br/><br/>Usually, after attending one of these events they show up to the Open Play events. And from then on out they are often repeat customers. This has quadrupled \u2013 at least \u2013 the number of female attendees in the Open Play event.<br/><br/>There have also been a handful of people who have expressed that just knowing that there was a Ladies' Night event as an option made them feel more comfortable coming to the Open Play event (\u201cat least I have a Plan B if this doesn't quite work out\u201d). Or, that it made the difference between attending our event over some other gaming event in town that did not make the extra effort in this department.<br/><br/>I find the current language of the event posting to not quite emphasis enough the inclusion of other gender minorities (which, I agree with what was said earlier, in that there is a potential privilege issue in simply using this phrase). Really, anybody who does not identify as simply male is welcome to this event. Trans, gender queer, other identities to which I am not sufficiently aware, what have you. <br/><br/>Is there room for improvement? Totally. Are there other options? Totally. Is this right for any given community? Maybe, dunno. I can tell you that it might be the coolest and most important event in the Portland gaming community, considering the impact that it has had.<br/><br/>If there are more specific questions about this event, I'll try and answer them (though this thread has moved on, looks like). Or have one of the ladies do so.<br/><br/>Tayler<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412844">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/alexalgebra" title="alexalgebra"><img alt="alexalgebra" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/alexalgebra">alexalgebra</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412844/#Comment_412844" name="Item_106" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-27T03:12:59+00:00" title="April 27, 2013  3:12AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you so much for your posts, Tayler!  You said a lot of things about systemic oppression against women that I was going to say.  Thanks for saving me the typing <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>Also, that's cool that Ladies Night is open to any non-cismale folks; I was not aware of that!  I was actually curious about that.<br/><br/>So...here is my background, so y'all know where I'm coming from.  First of all, I'm tired so sorry if I ramble.  Secondly, I'm queer and genderqueer/transgender (somewhere in there...I don't really know, I'm just Alex!)  I was socialized female and made a terrible attempt at doing the whole female thing for about 20 years before throwing in the towel and giving society's gender culture the finger, so I have experienced life as a woman, a man (which I'm generally read as these days, and I use male pronouns so that's alright with me), and as an androgynous question mark (my preferred state of being).<br/><br/>I am an activist and I have dedicated the past five years of my life to ending discrimination for non-straight folks through an organization that I run.  I am an educator on how to interrupt oppression and I have done a fair bit of training and studying on how oppression and privilege works.  I would not, by any means, consider myself an expert on the topic, but I consider myself competent and capable enough to speak about it publicly.  I'm a little upset over some people's responses, so this might not be the friendliest of responses, and I apologize for that in advance.<br/><br/>I have a few points, some of which have already been made, but obviously bear repeating because some people on here don't quite get it...<br/><br/>Also, I'm speaking in general about cis folks when I say male and female, although some of this applies to passing transfolks as well, but we have our own set of non-privilege/safety concerns/etc. that run far deeper than a lot of this.<br/><br/>1. Women are systematically oppressed.  Tayler has listed several examples of this that are not entirely in the context of gaming, but are still relevant (such as a woman feeling unsafe traveling at night to get to a meetup).<br/><br/>2. Another consideration that has not really been touched on is that men are celebrated in our society.  Men are given all the space they want.  They are welcome just about everywhere, and wherever they go, they are considered to be the authority over women, and they are allowed to take up as much space as they need, and then some.  The world revolves around men.  You cannot debate this with me, because you are wrong and this is fact.  This does not mean that in every single situation where there are men and women involved that men are dominant; it means that our society is set up in a way that makes these facts true overall.<br/><br/>3. Men, as the dominant majority, are not allowed to speak for women on the topic of gender inequity.  They are not allowed to tell women what is best for them, because they are not women.  Women are allowed to speak on their experiences as women, and men have to listen to them, and respect their experiences, because they happened.  They are fact and cannot be denied.  Women are allowed to talk about what is best for them, personally, as women, and men have to listen to that, because women know what is best for them as women and men do not.<br/><br/>4. Men, because they are allowed, 99.9% of the time, to take up as much space as they want and are included everywhere, get really sad when there's a party they're not invited to.  They get their man-panties all in a bunch and scream about "reverse sexism" (hint: it doesn't exist) and talk about how everyone is a hypocrite, kind of like a toddler screaming about not getting candy at the supermarket.<br/><br/>5. Women-only spaces are not about men.  They are about women.  This can be difficult for some men to wrap their head around, because they are men, and the world is set up to revolve around them at all times, but it's true.  You cannot debate this, because it is also a fact.<br/><br/>6. It is not some kind of "segregation" or "discrimination" to have a space that is set up by and for a group that is not the dominant majority.  It is a safe space for people that experience systematic oppression in their daily lives where they can take some of the load off, knowing that they are with company that experiences this same oppression.  Safe spaces for non-dominant-majority groups are incredibly important.  They are empowering because they are place where people can shed a layer of anxiety/fear/trauma/etc. and let themselves show through and enjoy themselves more than they might in the same situation except mixed-company.<br/><br/>7.  Reverse sexism does not exist.  It is a buzz-phrase and a derailing tool made by men to keep women silent and to keep the status quo that men dominate all spaces.  You cannot discriminate against someone that has privilege in regards to their privilege; that's not how institutional oppression works.<br/><br/>Obviously, not every man in the world is a cock-swinging jerk, peeing on his territory and whatnot; these are general statements about society and how men and women interact in this framing.  Also, the benefits that men receive for being born men don't always look extreme, like a caveman.  They happen in subtle ways that you probably don't even notice, if you are a man.  If you think these things aren't relevant to gaming, you're wrong.  We bring our whole selves to our games, and that includes our entire lifetime of experiences.  These things are all incredibly valid.<br/><br/>Also, I would like to add my own personal experience with segregated groups.  As a queer person, specifically as a gender non-conforming queer person, I often feel threatened around straight men.  I am a different person in a group of activist-minded queer folks than I am in a mixed-company, straight male dominated group.  I am afraid to be myself, to come out, to speak my life experience, or to talk about topics that are important to me when I'm around straight men, unless they have said or done something that has shown me that they are safe people that won't ask me creepy questions or make rude comments.  There is a level of understanding among queer folks where I don't have to explain a lot of things about myself that I feel I have to explain (or hide) around straight people, specifically men.  It's not that I am a man-hater, it's that your average, run-of-the-mill straight man has never had his reality shaken or had to face what it means to have straight male privilege, and I am forced to consider dozens of things related to my gender every time I leave the house - even though I have the luxury of "passing privilege" at this point in my life.  It also doesn't mean I think you're a bad person if you are a straight man that I don't necessarily trust, it just means I think you're ignorant about oppression (because you haven't had a reason to learn and nobody has taught you) and have some catching up to do.<br/><br/>I would also like to say that at our regular story games night in Portland, and at other gaming events here, I have been very happily surprised at the amount of queer folks and non-cismale folks that show up, and that makes me feel a lot better in general about being a part of the community.  I definitely was scared away from gaming for a long time because I was afraid I wouldn't be accepted as equal based on my gender and sexuality!  It's nice that it's generally a non-issue <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  The only times I have felt uncomfortable in this regard were when people made inappropriate or privileged comments (about anything - gender, race, sexuality, etc.), which has happened only a few times.<br/><br/>I apologize for the long post and for repeating some things.

I have to admit I haven't had time to read through all of the comments here, but I'm happy to see such an active discussion about inclusiveness in our community. I'm now in Seattle and no longer directly involved with the Play Out Loud or the Portland Ladies' Night, but I thought I should at least chime in as the gal who started the event. Tayler, thanks so much for saying most of what I would have said.<br/><br/>Here is the text of a document, to be found on through Play Out Loud's facebook page, that describes my original intentions for Ladies' Night in a little more depth: \n<blockquote><i>Ladies\u2019 Night: Purpose and Intentions</i><br/><br/><b>Who is this for?</b><br/>This event is for people who represent minority gender identities within the gaming community. If you self-identify as male, if you most comfortably refer to yourself by using male pronouns and prefer others to do the same, if you feel most at home in male-predominated environments, it is probably not for you. But if any of those statements are untrue, uncomfortable, or problematic for you, then please join us! This is for you.<br/><br/><b>Why do we need this event?</b><br/>Like many women, I enjoy gaming with male-identified folks. I think they can be just as smart, fun, creative, and generally awesome as anyone else. The thing is, they already have a safe space where they can feel at home, in the majority, \u201camong their own people.\u201d It\u2019s called the general gaming community. Most of the time, no one is trying to be exclusive or marginalizing. Many guys actively want to welcome a more diverse community. But the reality is that we live in a historical and cultural context such that gender minorities might feel unwelcome, uncomfortable, or even unsafe at standard gaming events, even despite the best efforts of everyone involved. The purpose of this event is to create a safe space for those people. <br/><br/><b>Where do we go from here?</b><br/>My hope is that, someday, Ladies\u2019 Night, along with other efforts from many fronts, will work itself out of a job. When we have achieved a truly all-inclusive community, it will become obsolete, and that will be awesome. In the meantime, this event and the community around it will strive to take small, relentless steps towards that vision. I hope that Ladies\u2019 Night will grow, and that the men in our lives, in the Play Out Loud community, and in the gaming community at large will continuously grow in their support of us. I hope that this will be an opportunity for us to make our presence as members of the gaming community impossible to ignore. </blockquote>\nAs I've already seen several people express in the comments here, excluding a certain group of people who already have a safe space is not the ultimate intention, but a means to welcome people to the community who might otherwise feel excluded.<br/><br/>Thanks for the great discussion!<br/><br/>- Hannah                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412859/#Comment_412859" name="Item_112" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-27T08:12:09+00:00" title="April 27, 2013  8:12AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ugh, the dogma in this thread seems like a tactical error.<br/><br/>I used to think more like <a href="/forums/profile/Dreamofpeace">@Dreamofpeace</a>, but am in the process of changing my mind.  Mostly because I am in a profession which almost completely consists of men, and I've read data and anecdotes that indicate to me that trying to be equitable is not a way to increase female participation in that or other male-dominated communities.  However, we can't pretend that excluding men from events isn't discriminatory (I doubt it's frequently sexist).  You can quibble about semantics and the word "discriminatory" if you want, but certainly it participates in the same sort of behavior that put us in the situation we are in now.  It's unequal, but that doesn't mean it's not worthwhile and it doesn't mean it's unfair.  But those aspects aren't central to our discussion, but rather whether it works.  (In other spaces, like education, they are, because unequal systems are often illegal.)\n<blockquote>Usually, after attending one of these events they show up to the Open Play events.

I've had success with that tactic for lessening the sting of criticism, but never in the context of "you're being sexist".)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412895/#Comment_412895" name="Item_119" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-27T15:23:07+00:00" title="April 27, 2013  3:23PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nobody is ever going to crack a Funnay Joek about my race or gender that I get hurt by, because from end to end my nation/state/city/occupation/society is set up in their favor.

As I\u2019ve missed quite a few opportunities to respond specifically to specific comments I\u2019ll confine myself to speaking to the subject in general. <br/><br/>I continue to be amazed by the apparent huge difference in gaming culture between the US and the UK. I know a lot of folks can\u2019t believe all this bottom-pinching and leering etc. desn\u2019t go on here, but the evidence for it simply isn\u2019t there. Thank God. James_Fleming mentioned it happening at events invlolving anime and cosplay. This does make some sense to me as there\u2019s dressing up involved, which could lead some men to think it\u2019s ok to touch, as they\u2019re only elves etc., or because by dressing up in this way the women concerned are \u2018asking for it\u2019, an excuse you often hear in rape cases when the victim was allegedly \u2018sexily dressed\u2019. It\u2019s astonishing in fact, and deeply depressing, that this excuse still gets trotted out but it apparently does. As to GMs doing obnoxious things to female characters in-game, as 3Jane mentioned when linking to a thread on UKRP, sure, that happens, there\u2019s plenty of anecdotal evidence for it, I\u2019m just saying the out of game stuff is less well documented.   <br/><br/>This is an issue with, sadly, a huge amount of polarisation, making it difficult to impossible for a sensible debate to occur, which is a pity because that\u2019s precisely what\u2019s needed. At times the debate got so heated it almost became a flame war, and I worried that the site would have to be re-named the Small Purple, or the Big Mauve, or whatever. Thankfully, the brink was pulled back from, which is good because what happens in flame wars is that folks with a calm and measured opinion go \u2018Yikes! Now, where\u2019s my asbestos jacket? Damn, it\u2019s at the cleaners\u2019, and stay out of it, leaving the field free for the more extreme elements to fling fireballs around with abandon.  <br/><br/>The aspect of the debate with the most polarisation- which admittedly occupies a good deal of the thread-  is the one about women-only spaces, with some saying it\u2019s a good idea, and others expressing queasiness with the implications of actual, as opposed to effectively, gender-excluding events. Here are a selection of the latter:\n<blockquote>I can't get behind excluding people based on gender, race, religion, whatever. It just doesn't seem right to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>I find myself in sympathy with Ben's principle of "celebrate, don't exclude".  Being told you're not welcome at an event because your behavior is unacceptable is one thing - you can control it or change it - but being told you're not welcome because of your gender is hurtful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>I agree, segregation only enhances in equality and hatred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><blockquote>I find myself in sympathy with Ben's principle of "celebrate, don't exclude".</blockquote>\nMe too. I also agree with <a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">@WarriorMonk</a> when he writes that women should be treated as people, and not as something different. Don't invite women just because they are women. The word "invite" makes the impression that you bring "them" into your world. Have as a goal to <i>involve</i> both genders and let it be 50-50 at best.</blockquote>\nI too am uneasy about solving gender exclusion with, uh, gender exclusion. I do  realise that if you simply can\u2019t get anywhere trying to solve the problem from within you might sometimes have to \u2018take it outside\u2019, hence direct action. But I think gender exclusion is such a bad thing in general that it can\u2019t be the answer, even in the short term. Let me try to explain why. There are already plenty of areas of life where there are women-only and men-only groups: a group of women having lunch together, a group of men down the pub together. Both groups presumably feel they can talk about stuff without being misunderstood, stuff mainly they are interested in which they perhaps wouldn\u2019t get the chance to talk about so freely otherwise. Ok, fine, they have a good time and no-one gets hurt. But is it fine? Another example: I used to work as what in the States would I believe be called an ESOL teacher; most weeks a group of us would go down the pub to unwind, typically on a Friday night after work. Now, a feature of TEFL here in the UK is that the gender split in the staff room is roughly 50:50, meaning that these outings ended up being pretty mixed on most occasions. And I enjoyed them much much more than if the participants had been mostly or wholly male. Now I reaise that the women-only gaming areas are intended to solve a specific problem, that of bringing into gaming women put off by male-dominated gaming events and male-dominated gaming culture. All I\u2019m saying is be very very careful; beware the development of gender segregation any more than already exists, because it\u2019s <i>not healthy</i>.<br/><br/>Another part of the thread has been the people saying things like \u2018Don\u2019t criticise and bellyache, help to come up with with solutions\u2019. The thing is, if you think a particular solution is wrong you need to say why. Yes, <i>then</i> you should try to think of other solutions, but not before explaining why the original one is wrong. And\u2026  \n<blockquote>I am very excited about doing things instead of talking about things.</blockquote>\nDoing things is great, but so is talking. Talking is what prevents nations from going to war, people from committing acts of terrorism, couples from getting divorced, and neighbours from poisoning each other\u2019s dogs. Without talking we\u2019re finished. So please, let\u2019s continue talking, but quietly, and pausing occasionally to listen to what the other person is saying.<br/><br/>Just to be balanced, something that a lot of the male posters are not feeling is that they will never know what it\u2019s like to experience the kinds of things that the excluded female gamers have, not only because they\u2019re not of that gender, but because, as JD Corley points out above, they\u2019re from the power-wielding majority, and are probably not aware of a tenth of the power they wield. That\u2019s not to bash them, just to say they should take care to phrase their comments about women\u2019s issues sensitively.  <br/><br/>Oh, and one last thing, as a kind of illustration of what we\u2019re up against. When I first posted about my game Where The Heart Is on another forum, one with a more trad focus, this is the first response I got:<br/><br/><b>Poster:</b> It looks distressingly thespy.<br/><br/><b>Quoting the WtHi Introduction:</b> [Is] the traditional family unit (at least, as conceived of in modern industrialised societies, i.e. consisting of one or two parents plus their- usually but not always- biological offspring) necessarily the best model?

Or a group of siblings, each with children of their own, all being parents to all of the children? Essentially what I\u2019m asking is, what does, or should, a modern family look like?

A fundamental part of the atrocious treatment of women in gaming culture(s) is that novicehood is conflated with women (ie: "girls don't play games" so they don't count as "real gamers" so we treat them like shit).<br/><br/>For the umpteenth time: these kinds of events are explicitly designed to provide a safe space for woman-identified people to gain or hone their competency, fluency, and expertise, which in turn enables them to feel more comfortable and confident in "ordinary" gaming contexts, demonstrating to others in the community that women CAN and DO play (and make) games, and contributing to a more inclusive culture for <i>all kinds</i> of marginalized people and novices.<br/><br/>There has been substantial evidence of this productive effect shared by women who have posted in this thread from their own experiences (and I pointed to a parallel example in indie video games: <a href="http://dmg.to" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://dmg.to</a>), but as <a href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">@Mcdaldno</a> said upthread, there's a lot of men proselytizing about women instead of listening to them.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412917/#Comment_412917" name="Item_123" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-27T19:06:18+00:00" title="April 27, 2013  7:06PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't read the WHOLE whole thread, but I've read a lot of it.<br/><br/>I don't have much to say, but I feel like I should speak up and applaud Hannah, Alex, Tayler, etc, and say I back up all of their statements one hundred per fucking cent.

First, as I mentioned previously, the issue is not as Lizziestark and a few others mistakenly maintain, about a group of friends meeting privately to game who all happen to be women; it is about an *organization* holding a specific event that will not allow men to attend.  The former is analogous to some guy friends and I going out for drinks; the latter is gender discrimination, and organizations have been sued successfully for doing exactly this (yes, for having women-only events or classes) \u2013 not in a gaming context that I\u2019m aware of, but certainly in educational and other contexts (so if your organization is planning on doing this, you should probably get good legal advice first).<br/><br/>Secondly, I disagree quite strongly with some of the feminist assumptions that some posters have listed (I think many are flat wrong).  This thread isn\u2019t the place to go into discussing what\u2019s right or wrong about feminism or specific versions thereof; I\u2019m mentioning this to point out that we don\u2019t have to agree on politics or political theory to have a common goal that we can support each other in achieving, in this case making gaming a more inclusive, welcoming experience for all.  <br/><br/>Finally, let\u2019s stop making it personal and talk about the helpful ideas instead.  In particular, don\u2019t make assumptions that because someone disagrees with your politics that they are somehow misinformed or uneducated.  For myself, I am a health care professional (have been for 16 years) and 80-90% of my patients are women; many of those women I treat have been physically, sexually, or emotionally abused, including being raped.  My day job is to help relieve people\u2019s suffering and help them to heal, and I do this mostly for women.  I have been privileged to see and assist many of those hurt to become whole.  My views have developed not because I\u2019m uninformed (and I used to have what some would call more traditional feminist views), but because I am informed in what it takes people to heal (and this can\u2019t be summarized in a \u201cone-size fits all\u201d clich\xe9).  So I\u2019d like to suggest people drop the personal assumptions and focus on the common goal that I hope most of the readers of this thread share.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamofpeace" title="Dreamofpeace"><img alt="Dreamofpeace" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/262/nTKQSP3YRT3C1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamofpeace">Dreamofpeace</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412924/#Comment_412924" name="Item_126" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-27T21:35:37+00:00" title="April 27, 2013  9:35PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, here are some of the suggestions I\u2019ve seen on this thread that seem to me to be especially helpful, and ones that I have questions about (some of this was already compiled by Rickard):<br/><br/>From kaser:\n<blockquote><br/>1) Intervene and call people out when you see bad behavior, even when not directed at you (e.g. sexist or homophobic language and jokes).<br/><br/>2) Use a safe word (or maybe x-card) that will remove and rewind/fix an uncomfortable situation. This is established at the beginning of a meetup or con, and once invoked it will not be questioned. Simply rewind and do it again without the content that caused discomfort. I've personally used the x-card in many of my games, which I think helped put new players at ease. <br/></blockquote>\nWe use something very similar to this in SGS (the \u201cveil\u201d).  It is for dealing with elements in the game fiction that may be uncomfortable; everyone is glad it\u2019s there even if they don\u2019t use it themselves.  Would it be helpful to also have a word for out-of-character, player-to-player interactions?  What comes to mind is the \u201cyellow light, red light\u201d method some organizations use.  \n<blockquote><br/>4) Encouraging game designers to make their games more inclusive. There's been a lot of this type of encouragement on S-G, which I appreciate. I haven't seen a chainmail bikini in a long time!<br/></blockquote>\nThat sounds like two kinds of things (both good).  First, in the game text designers can use more inclusive language and use diverse examples.  Second, avoid offensive stereotypes.<br/><br/>From Eero Touvinen:\n<blockquote><br/>In practice this has meant encouraging people to speak up if they've got problems, interpersonal problems included. Anybody who thinks that this is a difficult way to solve the problem of female comfort in a male-dominated hobby has my agreement, but it seems to work over time, and it has the advantage of transforming the community given enough patience: as you communicate the message that this community does not accept e.g. sexual harassment, and complaints are dealt with in a just way that does not fall into dogmatism (both ignoring minority complaints and over-reacting to them causes problems, long-term), both onlookers and people being bullied gain courage to uphold social standards. I've also found that men take a passive equality strategy more positively than an active one: most Finnish men I've met are eager to participate in upholding a no-bullying, no-harassment policy, going as far as to police each other, while many would be confounded or suspicious over positive discrimination. That's probably a pretty normal situation - see my reaction to women only game-nights up top.<br/></blockquote>\nFrom Anansigirl:\n<blockquote><br/>1. Show the faces of the women in your organization. <br/>2. Reach out to women in the community and personally invite them.<br/>3. Recruit women from adjacent geeky interests (cosplay, fetish, video games, geeky knitting). <br/>3. Welcome new gamers, many women are not as entrenched in the gaming communities.<br/>4. Reduce antagonism toward feminine things in you games, at your events. Have feminine coded stuff around in addition to the masculine stuff that's usually around.<br/></blockquote>\nI could use some more explanation about # 4.  Can you give some examples?  What feminine things are we talking about, and what does it mean for a thing to be feminine coded or masculine coded?\n<blockquote><br/>5. Play games that are gender inclusive.<br/></blockquote>\nFrom David Berg:\n<blockquote><br/>1) Attach an "X card" table action to some event authority, so it doesn't depend on the errant group for validation. I mean, if I wound up at a table of people who weren't treating me with respect, I certainly wouldn't expect them to treat my "X card" with respect of their own accord. Maybe a buzzer that summons an organizer, with the expectation that the organizer isn't going to lay down the law, but rather simply support the idea that the "X card" is valid and the issues are relevant? So if the group can fairly address it themselves, the organizer moves on, but if not, then they can step in to assert the values and m.o. of the event.<br/></blockquote>\nIf I understand correctly, the type of X-card you\u2019re talking about here is about interpersonal interaction as opposed to in-game fiction (or did you mean for it to cover both?).  I think the ability to summon an event authority is a good idea, but I wouldn\u2019t exclude first trying the X-card within the group.  Sometimes people don\u2019t realize what they\u2019re doing until they get the \u201cyellow light\u201d.\n<blockquote><br/>2) Construct activities specifically for boors so those who don't want to deal with boors can avoid them.<br/></blockquote>\nThis is funny :-) Did you really mean it?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamofpeace" title="Dreamofpeace"><img alt="Dreamofpeace" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/262/nTKQSP3YRT3C1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamofpeace">Dreamofpeace</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412925/#Comment_412925" name="Item_127" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-27T21:36:39+00:00" title="April 27, 2013  9:36PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><br/>4) Establish standards for conduct and clear signals to evoke those standards.

During a convention or major gathering, have every staff understand how to handle sexual harassment. I myself would feel hesitant how I should go through with a complaint of sexual harassment. Perhaps have one person in charge if that happens. Also, discuss after the convention how much complaints that occurred during the convention, and how it was handled.<br/><br/>1b. Draw up some guidelines to treat everyone with respect, for the visitors to read up on in folders, at the homepage et c. Discuss after the conventions if the guidelines needs to be changed.<br/><br/>2. Sometimes have a majority of women that organize the conventions. This is important because it can bring the feeling of "I can also do that" for other women. It can also create a feeling of safety and avoid alienation to see other women.<br/><br/>3. Create a mentoring for newcomers for the first year, and strive to have a women mentor another woman. There are a lot of thresholds to overcome if you're feeling like a minority and have to make your way through a new territory, and another woman can guide you to avoid her own pitfalls. The mentor can also hook the newbie up with connections and act like a safety net. Critique, as an example, is made to the mentor and not the newcomer.<br/><br/>4. Putting both genders in leading roles at conventions for the same reason as in point 2.<br/><br/>[edit] 5. Have as a general guideline to always ask a women first for a role, up until there are almost 50-50 balance. I myself know how easy it is to ask friends first, or follow old tracks and involving the same dude year after year. It's sometimes not enough to be open and inclusive in mind.

Of all the seventy-something roleplaying games printed in Swedish, I can recall three female authors being involved in perhaps six productions. It gives a raised eyebrow if a woman is involved, and this is only because of the feeling that women are rare in our hobby. Having more female names in our activities makes the male gamers more aware of and used to their presence, so women aren't treated as freak  shows as soon as they turn up. Because all this isn't just about making women feel welcomed, it's also about changing the usual gamers view of it all.<br/><br/>To summarize: if you want to organize something, it's easy to ask around in your friendship group or the same guy that takes care of it year after year. Try next time to reach out and ask a female gamer instead, just to show that you care about this topic. At least until the general ratio of males and females, that are included in our hobby, are more healthy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412951/#Comment_412951" name="Item_132" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-28T08:29:32+00:00" title="April 28, 2013  8:29AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey everyone,<br/><br/>In case you're new or didn't know or something, I'm a moderator here on Storygames! So I'm watching this thread (and so are Andy and Jason, fellow moderators) to make sure that it's a safe, inclusive space to talk about gender issues in gaming communities.<br/><br/>I think personal anecdotes are really important, especially based on gender experiences, and thank you to the women who are speaking in this thread! It's unusual to see this many women posting on a thread like this, especially being open about their genderqueer situation. It makes me really happy to see that. THANK YOU.<br/><br/>I'm also really appreciating hearing experiences from the woman organizers and what is working for them. I can use this as a useful template moving forward, and that's practical, good advice. I'd really like to network with all of you and create a g+ page or something for women organizers of game nights (or game night organizers for women) where we can share and trade strategies.<br/><br/>As far as feminism and its different iterations... I think it's hard because the gaming community seems trapped in the past with some of these issues. It'd be great to see gaming cultures and organizations functioning at a level of contemporary feminism with a lot of other social groups, but even most social groups that aren't mostly consisting of men are still problematic in some way toward women based on the social dynamic that still exists between men and women and the inequality there. <b>This is a fact!</b> It's getting better, but we're not near equal yet, in many, many impactful ways.<br/><br/>I'll say it again, <b>let's focus on personal experiences and what's worked for you and ideas about how to make gaming spaces more inclusive.</b><br/><br/><b>Let's also keep it civil! It's good to point out mistakes in language, but do it in a respectful way please!</b><br/><br/><b>One of the ways that seems to be very very functional is a Ladies Night. That is good. Let's go forward with that in mind, and if you want to dispute the gender inclusiveness of a Ladies Night, please take that off thread. There's legitimate things to talk about there!! But that's not useful or productive to this conversation, or where gaming groups clearly are socially. They need things like Ladies Nights to redistribute gender equality. <i>We're not here in this thread to dispute that kind of thing, and once we start getting into it it changes the topic, and it also silences those in this thread who are trying to share their experiences by invalidating them.</i> So yea, people who want to dispute the legalities, exclusiveness, "real feminism" or whatever of one gender only spaces please don't do that in this thread. </b><br/><br/>(as a note, I love disputing gender stuff, I'm in the middle of reading Sexing the Body right now by Fausto-Sterling, and the complexities, nuances, and cultural vs scientific impact of gender interests me intensely.

The reason I think it would be useful is that often someone may feel uncomfortable with an aspect of in-game fiction that comes about innocently, e.g., the GM is narrating a scene where a dog is catching a squirrel, not meaning to offend or disturb anyone - but it just happens to be that a player is disturbed by this for some personal reason.  Thus I think it would be helpful to have some way (like "the veil") to say, "nobody's at fault, but please let's not go there" in addition to a yellow or red light which says "your personal behavior towards me is not acceptable, stop it."\n<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>2) Construct activities specifically for boors so those who don't want to deal with boors can avoid them.</blockquote>\nThis is funny :-) Did you really mean it?<br/></blockquote>I did!

I can say that for myself, there have been many times in my life, some in gaming situations, some not, where I have not felt comfortable or safe enough to even speak up and advocate for myself (or someone else that was obviously being made uncomfortable).  Some days I can, but some days it's too much, because I've had a lifetime of being silenced and derailed and ignored since I'm not part of the dominant majority.  I also deal with a hefty dose of anxiety, so I can get kind of "deer-in-the-headlights" when I get triggered.<br/><br/>I realize this makes me a bit of a hypocrite because my life's work is based around educating people on how to speak up in these kinds of situations, but we also teach people that if it's not safe, it's ok to deal with it at a later time or not at all.  Self-care is number one.<br/><br/>For me - and this is just me! - I GREATLY appreciate it when someone else speaks up for me when I am visibly uncomfortable and cannot speak for myself.  Because I'm so used to being ignored or derailed, sometimes if someone that is of the majority (generally this happens to me with trans-related comments, so this would be a cisperson, but it applies to whatever) says something on my behalf, it is taken more seriously.  It's bullshit, but assholes are assholes and if it takes an ally to get them to stop saying inappropriate things, then I am grateful for the ally.  If I had trouble with someone at a game night and one (or more!) people spoke up with me or on my behalf (especially the GM or group leader), I would go back to that night and just avoid the rude person, and moreover, feel empowered to stand up for myself and know people would have my  back if the situation occurred again.  If people just stayed quiet and watched me squirm, I would probably just leave mid-game or immediately following the end if I was too paralyzed with anxiety to interrupt the game, and never come back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Also - Orlando, although I see what you're saying on why cis isn't relevant to this conversation, I feel like it's important to acknowledge that trans and gender non-conforming folks have a different experience than cis folks.  A transwoman, for example, might not only encounter everyday sexism or sexist comments, but also cissexism and cissexist comments that add an additional layer to the gender discussion.  I think that in a discussion about gender imbalance and inclusion, we need to recognize safety for all genders and gender expressions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412987/#Comment_412987" name="Item_136" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-28T18:50:32+00:00" title="April 28, 2013  6:50PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 28, 2013 7:06PM by Andy.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From Kira, not even 5 public posts above:<br/><br/>----<br/><b>One of the ways that seems to be very very functional is a Ladies Night.

Thanks to everyone who has contributed positively to this thread - I've learned a lot by listening and keeping my e-mouth shut up to this point. I'm Mr. Privilege - a straight, white, mid-40's male-born-male person from a solid upwardly-mobile middle class family. <br/><br/>I do see a parallel that I'd like to throw out. Nota bene: the following is grossly simplified, and anyone wishing further conversation on the specifics is welcome to message me privately.<br/><br/>I've been a professional church musician for nearly 30 years, as a choir director/organist/pianist/soloist/what-have-you. When I was in school for a church music degree, it was the mid 1980's and there was a big, disputative ongoing conversation about the role of women in the church (in my case, various mainstream Protestant denominations), not just in clergy positions, but as "consumers" of liturgy and hymnody - the technology of worship, if you will. There were also parallel movements in queer theology and the stirrings of the 50's/60's Liberation theology into the mainstream. I was regularly involved in discourse about inclusive language in worship, the patriarchal poisoning of the essential messages of the Gospels, and other soi-disant radical concepts. <br/><br/>During that time, and for years afterwards, I often had friends (women and gay men, predominantly) go off to retreats or conferences where I was specifically not invited, to discuss these issues that were so close to my heart and mind. I was always sad. "Surely, I would have something to contribute?" "Yes, Paul, but you do that here... I know you, but not everyone would, and sometimes..."<br/><br/>And the thing is that sometimes, not always but often enough, my friends would return from these events brimming with ideas and energy to bring to the general conversation - I once compared it to the static electricity from a dryer full of socks, sparking and startling. This changed the dialogue, and the modern church is a benefactor - the current United Methodist Hymnal was highly influenced by these formal and informal caucuses, to the good.<br/><br/>I guess my point is that intentional communities with a specific common purpose can often benefit the larger, more inclusive community. I want to game with everyone and anyone, and if ideas and sparks and... electricity come out of events that I'm not invited to and reach my games and my heart, well, cool.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412999/#Comment_412999" name="Item_138" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-28T20:31:40+00:00" title="April 28, 2013  8:31PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just want to say that I'm reading and learning, which is a great thing.<br/><br/>A huge thanks to all those of you who are willing to contribute personal anecdotes or viewpoints.

The reason I think it would be useful is that often someone may feel uncomfortable with an aspect of in-game fiction that comes about innocently, e.g., the GM is narrating a scene where a dog is catching a squirrel, not meaning to offend or disturb anyone - but it just happens to be that a player is disturbed by this for some personal reason.  Thus I think it would be helpful to have some way (like "the veil") to say, "nobody's at fault, but please let's not go there" in addition to a yellow or red light which says "your personal behavior towards me is not acceptable, stop it."</blockquote>I've never been in a situation where behavior crossed the line into obviously unacceptable, so my tendency is to assume best intentions.  Accordingly, assigning fault isn't really on my radar.  If someone's uncomfortable, then we solve that problem as best we can, regardless of how exactly it arose.<br/><br/>That said, it wouldn't surprise me if other circumstances make your suggested approach superior.<br/><br/>I kinda hope someone with relevant personal experience (e.g. being harassed at a con game) weighs in on these ideas.  All I really have to contribute is brainstorming.\n<blockquote><blockquote>2) Construct activities specifically for boors so those who don't want to deal with boors can avoid them.</blockquote>\nHere's one possible problem: sometimes descriptions of activities may not be written or explained carefully, and sometimes people don't always read or hear carefully, and may make innocent mistakes - and a non-boor may accidentally attend a boorish activity.  The consequences could be dire...</blockquote>If one were to actually attempt this, significant effort should be put into crafting the perfect description of the boor-luring activity.  I don't think it's possible to create a description that attracts <i>only</i> boors, but I do think it's possible to create one that makes it clear to the boor-averse that the likelihood of boorish attendees is relatively high.  Supplemental announcements might be required.<br/><br/>I'm still not claiming this <i>is</i> a good idea, just that there's a non-zero chance that it <i>might</i> be.

But I want to; I think it's important, both to corroborate from the inside and to provide contrast to the second half of that point.  So that's me.  When I read about ladies' night, I get sad (maybe too strong a word, but something; jealous?) because I'm being excluded.  That's not supposed to happen! ;-)<br/><br/>But also, it's plainly obvious that the good that this exclusivity is aiming for is way more important than my little feelings and I can suck it up for that greater good.  Anyway, I wanted to own that.<br/><br/>Is this an appropriate place to ask about the use of three words: girl, lady and woman?  Calling a woman a girl is plainly insulting, right?  I sort of feel that way about <i>lady</i> but it seems like I'm in the minority; though since no one is offended by my using woman, I'm OK.  Is there anything more interesting to say about that?<br/><br/>I've been to several (like thirty?) public conventions.  I've seen poor, but not (I think/hope) crazy-poor, sexist behavior.  I've never called bullshit on anyone for it even when I felt like people were crossing the line.  There's this thing where I can't tell if the recipient/victim thinks it's a big deal -- big enough that I'd want to be supportive of them, right?  And like, if I stand up and call bullshit, and she thought it was nothing, maybe I fuck up the whole game.  And so I worry that these women were just enduring that bullshit because they didn't think anyone would support them and I'm the guy that wasn't trustworthy...  Am I the only one who doesn't know how to behave?  In this regard, I guess some sort of statement from the convention maybe, about expected behavior might help a little, but even then, all our programmed social stuff is going to override that.

If there's another person at the table that you are uncomfortable for then a check of 'are you OK with X' should be sufficient. If they are fine, then I guess you can put it down to misreading the situation. If they aren't then you can add at that point that you weren't either and suggest it's taken up with the table before things continue.<br/><br/>At the end of the day it's all a judgement call, it's just worth remembering that often if something is making you uncomfortable, it's probably also making other people at the table uncomfortable too, but being the one to call it out takes more confidence than thinking 'no-one else is commenting on this, it must just be me'. Getting rid of that atmosphere by bringing attention to the issue will help the session in the long run (or show the session for something you're better of not playing I guess :-)   )                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413047/#Comment_413047" name="Item_147" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-29T08:59:21+00:00" title="April 29, 2013  8:59AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">@ChristopherWeeks</a> -- great points.

My apologies for first bringing male exclussion into the thread, though I couldn't help but to feel a bit offended... though it's nothing but a fragment of how women must feel when treated in the same way by men. Keep that thought in your mind, as I'd like to propose (besides the "Ladies' Night", which I can see now under a different light) a whole "You're crossing the Line" campaign as part of common conventions.<br/><br/>It needs to be a campaign instead of a single rule or procedure, since the problem is too deep and delicate. You'll need posters for the whole place (better placed near the entrance, bathrooms and cafeteria) and red cards for all women attending - specially cosplayers and members of minorities. This red card should give that person the right to ask the organizers to remove sex-offenders from the event at least for the day. If an offender receives more than one red card and/or the situation requires, the punishment can go from expelling the offender without refund to calling higher authorities into the matter.<br/><br/>Of course you'll need a proper team of voluntaries (including an attorney) to enforce this through the whole con. But on the other side, having any event announce such policy from beforehand should certainly increase women and minorities attendance and decrease bad publicity brought by sex-offenders.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/adamwb" title="adamwb"><img alt="adamwb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/adamwb">adamwb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413455/#Comment_413455" name="Item_154" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-02T22:03:20+00:00" title="May  2, 2013 10:03PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Several posts here are about how to deal with bad people who show up.<br/><br/>If you are planning for that you have already lost.

Things that are about explicitly encouraging participation or describing the event welcomingly.

There is a general public perception that "women aren't funny", which has a real impact on the lives of female comedians. There'll be an article about it in some paper ever few months, you'll hear stories of patronising comments comedians have received, and the subject of 'women in comedy' will be brought up every time a comedienne is interviewed.<br/><br/>What's interesting in the case of the comedy world is I'm sure that it's just a elf-perpetuating myth. If people stopped talking about it, the fact that the scene is filled with great female comedians would end the entire 'debate'.<br/><br/>To clarify, I'm not saying that's the case in the role-playing world - I don't feel I've encountered any gender bias (apart from the chainmail bikini phenomenon), but then I'm a man, and I might not notice...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg" title="semajmaharg"><img alt="semajmaharg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/482/n0TRVVHW3SOVY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg">semajmaharg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413503/#Comment_413503" name="Item_159" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-04T07:44:23+00:00" title="May  4, 2013  7:44AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's a bit harsh to blame it on the elves...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413506/#Comment_413506" name="Item_160" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-04T09:20:08+00:00" title="May  4, 2013  9:20AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's definitely at least in part a problem of self-perpetuating myths in RPGs.

I can't even begin to explain, it's so bad. But I don't want to talk about that.<br/><br/>One solution, much like the Ladies' Night mentioned here, is woman(-and-girl)-focused groups that teach development skills and bring female developers together. One that exists in Durham is called "<a href="http://www.girldevelopit.com/" rel="nofollow">Girl Develop It</a>". I know the woman who started the Durham chapter and she invited me to join the Meetup group to see what they were doing. Last weekend, they had "Ladies Linux Day," where the participants were learning about and installing Linux. I freaking love Linux and also love inclusion, and I know that sometimes men have helped teach GDI classes, so I asked if I could come and help out. They were totally into it and I went and it was awesome.<br/><br/>What I noticed is that it was a space set up to acknowledge and avoid the normal gender issues in software development. It was first and foremost pro-woman, but anyone who is pro-woman was welcome. I was nervous going in because I didn't want to be perceived as an interloper or a guy trying to mansplain Linux. By the time I left, I felt really welcome.

This is all from my memory of what I was told -- I was not present for any of this, so feel free to add salt to taste.<br/><br/>At Hunter College High School, one teacher experimented with an all boys math class and an all girls math class. Something happened that made it necessary to combine the classes later in the year. I don't remember what it was, probably some teacher getting a long term illness or something similar.<br/><br/>The woman teaching the now combined class noticed two things:<br/><br/>1. The girls' grades stayed the same, but the boys' grades dropped a bit.<br/>2. The girls, who had been enthusiastic participants in the class, suddenly got quiet and didn't try to speak up as much.<br/><br/>There was an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_press_association" rel="nofollow">apa</a> whose name I forget. At one point, there was a decision to split it into the main apa (which everyone still participated in), an all women apa, and an all men apa. I was told that the first two continued on for several years, while the third folded after a couple of issues.<br/><br/>On the other side of the scale, Suzy McKee Charnas experimented with the idea of a language for women. When this met with a strong lack of interest, she concluded that women probably did not feel the need for a separate language of their own, even if that had not been her original hypothesis.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jiawen" title="Jiawen"><img alt="Jiawen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/292/nR08RUP20JH7I.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jiawen">Jiawen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414147/#Comment_414147" name="Item_166" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-15T23:15:32+00:00" title="May 15, 2013 11:15PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Terwox: not my area of specialty, but, I believe it's that the nouns male/female refer to biological sex, while the nouns man/woman refer to gender presentation.

"Biological sex" is a tricky term to define, and often gets used incorrectly with reference to trans people. What, after all, do we mean by "biology" when we're talking about sex? Hormones, chromosomes, hair length, genitals, secondary sex characteristics, bone density, brain constitution...? Probably some melange of those characteristics; and when most cis people talk about sex, that melange is often unfairly defined so that cis people are "natural" and trans people are somehow "artificial". <br/><br/>Male and female do indeed refer to sex, but saying that a trans guy would be "female" is incorrect at best.

I liked a lot of the discussion, but I felt that there were some slightly problematic undercurrents. The biggest for me was Ben discussing how he needs to give power to women. While it's often true that men are empowered in gaming culture and women are dis-empowered, it's also important to recognize (as Deliverator did above) that there are already a lot of women out there who are doing great  gaming. We don't necessarily need men to 'give' us power; we already have it ourselves. So I'd caution Ben to be careful -- acknowledging the power you have can easily turn into placing yourself in a position of authority. Be careful not to inadvertently dip into patronizing while you're working on your privilege. This was, as I said, an undercurrent, and it wasn't a major complaint for me. But it seemed perhaps implicit in some of what Ben said, so I wanted to address it here (while I'm delurking).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414149">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414149/#Comment_414149" name="Item_168" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-15T23:48:14+00:00" title="May 15, 2013 11:48PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 15, 2013 11:49PM by Ben_Robbins.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Jiawan">@Jiawan</a>: You're talking about a general case and you're right.

(Case in point, I've probably spent the better part of this afternoon getting the wording for this post right and I'm still afraid I'm unwittingly being a silly privileged prick.)<br/><br/>Is there room in this to have a little compassion for those of us who have an overwhelming amount of compassion for you but who are total n00bs at showing it? Is it possible to dial down the voltage on the third rail so that having an open conversation about it doesn't feel like making an Ob 4 test on 3 dice? We'll* get better. We will. But only if we practice. <br/><br/>(And yeah... being afraid to try is my issue. I'll own that. But, despite feeling pretty well-informed about this stuff, inadvertently getting branded with a scarlet letter at gaming conventions because I tried to help but just didn't know how is a very real fear for me. And feelings are always legit. A lot of the ideas in this thread have to do with publicly shaming the offender. I think that's the wrong approach if one of the goals is to actually change opinions and behavior. If you want someone to understand where you're coming from, you've gotta show them you understand where they're coming from - even if they're coming from a place of ignorance. Yeah, sometimes shame is the only tool that'll work, but it shouldn't be the first one you grab for.)<br/><br/>**And by we I guess I mean me.

I want to help! But sometimes I end up exploding bombs anyway!<br/><br/>Compassion should definitely go both ways, though. Here's one of the frustrating things about being a woman and wanting to talk about this stuff: you have to have the same conversation over and over again. It's kind of fun and informative and maybe you feel you're getting somewhere like the first eighteen times, but then it gets old. I guess what I'm saying is there's an imbalance -- it can be hard to remember that although this is the eight zillionth internet debate I've had about whether women's space is inherently sexist -- it may be the first or second for some of the people I'm talking to. So I think it's easy to understand why sometimes people's patience runs thin.<br/><br/>This doesn't mean we should stop having these conversations -- on the contrary, they're really important to have. The more we have them, the less we have to have them. How much better to be accused of mansplaining or chauvinism than to let unexamined sexism pass by without comment -- at least the first presents an opportunity to explain yourself with more nuance, allows the women in your community to talk about how they feel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w176" title="w176"><img alt="w176" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/649/nZVYYAKMQQQR6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w176">w176</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414683/#Comment_414683" name="Item_176" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-24T08:31:03+00:00" title="May 24, 2013  8:31AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            FemCon!<br/><br/><a href="http://www.gamingaswomen.com/posts/2013/05/femcon-a-feminist-gaming-convention-in-sweden/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.gamingaswomen.com/posts/2013/05/femcon-a-feminist-gaming-convention-in-sweden/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zelbinian" title="Zelbinian"><img alt="Zelbinian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/056/nMYJBWP65457Z.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zelbinian">Zelbinian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414691/#Comment_414691" name="Item_177" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-24T10:25:56+00:00" title="May 24, 2013 10:25AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/lizziestark">@lizziestark</a>: Thanks.<br/><br/>A big takeaway from this thread - and from reading about these issues in general - is that it takes a lot of effort for everyone. Maybe someday it'll be easy, but right now there's still a lot of unacknowledged bias (and, let's face it: biology) that gets in the way for <del>both</del> all groups. And having the wherewithal to be mindful that is complicated, messy, and often just plain exhausting.<br/><br/>I'll use my own experiences as an example. If asked my attitude towards women in gaming (or gender equality in general), I would have given you the same answer a year ago as I would give you today: I am all for including women in any activities they want to be included in and I am dedicated to treating women no differently than anyone else; women at the table is Not A Thing. And yet, if I think back to my year-ago self and if I'm really honest... sitting down at a table with a woman was <i>totally</i> A Thing, especially if she was pretty and double especially if she was GMing; I never explicitly omitted women from my gaming groups, but I routinely didn't think to ask if they wanted to be included; and I patronizingly assumed that new female players at my table needed more help than new male players. I was totally unaware that some of my behavior was not in line with my values or intentions. <br/><br/>I've learned a lot; I'm more aware of those biases and have eliminated or at the very least am far more mindful of them. I don't know about other men here, I've had to unlearn a lot of things I didn't even know I had learned about how to treat women. I was never guilty of any of the truly egregious offenses, but in a way the subtle ones are more insidious. I still struggle with it; I suppose we all do. And as frightened as I am about all the biases and behaviors I still don't know about - about how much I still have to learn - I'm glad that I keep reflecting and keep setting the bar higher for myself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415046/#Comment_415046" name="Item_178" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-30T13:15:40+00:00" title="May 30, 2013  1:15PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey everyone. Semi necro, but. I compiled a list of things that people were talking about here and elsewhere about how to run inclusive gaming events. Here's the post I put up about it on Gaming as Women. I think it's not perfect, but it's a great start on some tools organizers and members of communities can use!<br/><br/><a href="http://www.gamingaswomen.com/posts/2013/05/gender-inclusiveness-at-gaming-events/" rel="nofollow">Gender Inclusiveness at Gaming Events</a><br/><br/>Also, Femcon looks way cool.
