Very Hal 9000.<br/>* In a game riffing off of Summerland, with small human enclaves surrounded by the encroaching forests, the maelstrom was the forest itself, angry at humans. (Which made playing my Brainer weird, as my allegiance felt very split between my friends and the forest that could talk to me. That's also the game where I got the 29 experience in one session.)<br/><br/>How has the maelstrom manifested in your games?<br/><br/>- Ryan                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330229">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330229/#Comment_330229" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-16T11:14:35+00:00" title="June 16, 2011 11:14AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In our near-earth-orbit game, it's dead people. <br/><br/>In my other game, we all see it different ways - for me, it's usually very subtle, just a camera lens change and maybe a vision ... for our Skinner, it's a playground with mutant children who have mouths for eyes, and the mutant children are trying to tell her something ... nobody's punched through yet...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330233/#Comment_330233" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-16T11:19:34+00:00" title="June 16, 2011 11:19AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Possibly intelligent insect plagues and giant toxic trees.<br/>Ghosts when the mechanism to take souls of the dead away broke down.<br/>Gaia strikes back with mutants and megafauna.<br/>An alien parallel dimension that the crashed space ship ties into quite intimately.<br/>An intelligent creative force that has given up on humanity and is here to turn it into the next phase of the experiment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330238/#Comment_330238" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-16T11:34:39+00:00" title="June 16, 2011 11:34AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't played as many games, but in games I've MC'd I described it as a beach with a red tide, offering cryptic glimpses into the future.

This would look like: relative time speeds up for people around a lot of other people and slows down for people who are really isolated.  So, the great cities all burned up in a flash when this weird change happened and the other cities weren't too far behind.  But villages and farmstead, maybe they're still around.  And we were talking about a game set among the pacific islands where e.g. a lone traveler in an outrigger might paddle from one island to the next and it might seem like three weeks passed to that person, but to the villagers, it seems like she teleported.  None of this really addresses the personality of the psychic maelstrom, but it would surely be related to temporal disturbance of one kind and another.  At least one of the other players didn't like it so we passed on it but it still seems like a neat idea.  But if this ended up pushing people away from interpersonal interaction, that would pretty much be a fail.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher" title="Christopher"><img alt="Christopher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher">Christopher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330417/#Comment_330417" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-17T08:58:21+00:00" title="June 17, 2011  8:58AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm.

Every hostile facet of nature - the mutated, poisonous indigenous lifeforms, the vegetation, the foods, drinks and drugs derived from them, the bacteria and viruses, the rain and storms - are trying to rip sentience and free will from the remaining inhabitants, leaving them as idiot human husks, savages, and bottom feeders. The player characters and a handful of key NPCs are the only ones relatively unafflicted by the maelstrom, which is why their motivations are a tad bit more complex than "where can I get my next drink" and "who do I have to kill next to get what I want".<br/><br/>When you "open your mind" and hit, you get to commune with the icy cold remnants of that compounded lost intellect. When you fail, I ask you questions about your mental activity, and when you wake up those answers have been lost to you.<br/><br/>The Psychic Maelstrom is easily the most difficult part of AW for me as the MC. I'd be very interested in a thread discussing interpreting them, potential pitfalls, and complexity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331308/#Comment_331308" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-23T09:03:17+00:00" title="June 23, 2011  9:03AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree that the Maelstrom's the most difficult part of the game.  It often feels bolted on to the rest of the game rather than an integral part.  As both a player and an MC I felt put on the spot when I had to describe an interaction with it, and it seems like others I've played with were feeling the same.  The creative flow bogged down, and a lot of it felt artificial.  <br/><br/>In the game I ran last year, the Maelstrom was a source of information: the Hocus could pull "ancient" recorded music out of it, and push music into it; the Gunlugger could get tactical overhead maps from it.  Eventually it became apparent that it was composed of Matrix-y satellite AIs that used humans as hardware and fought each other for control of minds.  The game wrapped up before we got to explore this very much.<br/><br/>It's not real clear what the maelstrom is in our current game.
