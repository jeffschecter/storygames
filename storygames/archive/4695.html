You have some number of NPCs, I try to start with around four big ones, but it depends on how much exploration you want and how big of a setting, larger means you should have more NPCs ready.  These four each have different goals that conflict with each other in some way, some slight some major, which will create natural allies and enemies.  Something about them can't be ignored.  Either because the NPCs are important figures in the characters' lives, or because their goals effect the characters (at least half should be in some negative way and the rest just "different" but never overly positive) or some other reason.  You can break this down further and have more NPCs, or just more minor ones with further fractal goals of their own.  This way, something is always happening, but the players are free to do whatever they want. If they try to ignore them, since the presence is effecting them anyway, they can't truly ignore it and so there's still events happening.  Chances are they won't ignore it, but you still give them the freedom to choose sides, decide how they'll interact with the NPCs, maybe even decide to work for an NPC you expect to be a villain.  But since there's no plot, there's no problem. You just have fictional people with goals, who adjust in response to unexpected changes like people do.  The structure is in place for the players to explore the setting.<br/><br/>Spirit of the Centry has a distilled version of this in one of the three ways to create an adventure. All the current World of Darkness stuff is made to be sandboxed.  They don't even give you a completely explicit setting, just the societies and their rules that you use to set up your own setting.<br/><br/>I've played and run a lot of games like this, and they were fantastic.  There was always an ongoing plot, but only because character creates plot. Exploring the PCs and NPCs eventually creates it.  NPCs with big epic goals can lead to big epic plots without diminishing the ability to explore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105731/#Comment_105731" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-31T12:57:57+00:00" title="October 31, 2007 12:57PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see "sandbox" as likely meaning one end of a scale.<br/><br/>You can have a "heavily prepped, mapped out D&amp;D dungeon focused" campaign in which the GM is constantly asking and open to Player input and PC interests, they want to take on the drow, a drow pops up in this dungeon with a plot hook to a dungeon full of drow.  They want to explore stealth and trickery as tactics instead of combat, the dungeon full of drow is one where there are lots of opportunities for that.  The GM is still throwing out the plot hooks.  Why are you in this dungeon full of drow that calls for lots of sneaking?  The GM knows and tells you etc.  <br/><br/>The other end, what you're probably looking for, is described by Chris Chinn in his articles about setting up a few Conflicts with the attendant NPC's, these being conflicts of interest to the PC's, and then just asking them, "what do you do"?  This requires a system/DM ready to handle less prep-timed play.  I suspect it works better for narrativist/story type play with resolutions heavy on narration etc. (e.g., DiTV type rules) rather than gamist "Challenge" type play.<br/><br/>Implicitly, it's the way Mortal Coil advises to set up story.<br/><br/>Chinn's articles on conflict webs - protagonist play which is what I think is the wide open sandbox.<br/><a href="http://www.rpg.net/news+reviews/collists/waystoplay.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.rpg.net/news+reviews/collists/waystoplay.html</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105750/#Comment_105750" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-31T14:31:41+00:00" title="October 31, 2007  2:31PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ryan's method is one of memetic things that I sense people in college, at the mercy of borrowed D&amp;D books, have come up with. <br/><br/>You wake up with a knock at your apartment door. It's 4PM so obviously you're still in bed. You throw on pants and pop the deadbolt, and here comes everybody. You've got two friends and this girl you've been dating for two weeks; they bring over five people you don't know. Everyone has supplements you've never heard of, and asks you what level they should make characters at. You're about to protest when you see the pizza and beer.<br/><br/>So what do you do? You throw on a shirt and <i>grab your sandbox</i>. The little black box for all those notecards you never used in Poly Sci. Instead, you doodled a simple encounter: The Hook (what happens) The Bait (why they might care) The Hint (who/what helps them, how, and why) and What They Get if they choose to, along with possibly What Happens if they don't. Pull out half a dozen cards and spin a few yarns, and you've got a memorable game. It might not suck people into a stark personal space, but it'll be fun.

I see what you're saying, Ryan, but I think calling a Dogs town a sandbox is really stretching things. It's a charged, thematic <i>situation</i>, for sure. But I think that a sandbox (as I use the term) is something else. After all, in a Dogs town, you don't just "do stuff," you address the situation at hand and you judge the town. It isn't free-wheeling, do-anything play. In fact, it's a mission -- kind of the opposite of a sandbox.<br/><br/>I think Trollbabe <i>might</i> qualify for nar-style sandbox play, though. A big part of that game is pointing at the (mostly blank) map and saying, "I go there." Then, once in a situation, a Trollbabe has no mandate to stay and sort things out. Trollbabes can always just walk away from a situation and move on to the next part of the map. Abandoning situations and characters is one way to address premise, even.<br/><br/>Huh. Dogs and Trollbabe are kinda the same game in a lot of ways, but that's a key difference.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105973/#Comment_105973" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-01T10:23:42+00:00" title="November  1, 2007 10:23AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have to disagree.

I also pointed out right quick when a Belief was spent so they could attach their Belief to something else.<br/><br/>For example, the first part of the campaign was about participating in this war between a Dragon and the dwarven kings, so their Beliefs that were sandbox related were often linked to the Dragon or gaining the horde of orcs he had in his service.  Now the campaign is shifting towards moving back to the Broken Mountains, destroying Elven Citadels along the way and their Beliefs are reflecting that.<br/><br/>I like it when there is something mechanical to link to the exploration of the setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105996/#Comment_105996" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-01T11:15:08+00:00" title="November  1, 2007 11:15AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In sandbox play, does walking away from a Situation mean that, so long as the players don't decide to return to that Situation, that the implications of the Situation don't bleed out?<br/><br/>For example, if the players are given a Situational Hook that the local brigands are raiding merchant caravans on the trade route coming into town, and the players ignore it and leave the other side of town (thus not exploring that at all), should a Sandbox GM have a local kid seek revenge because their apathy to the town's plight caused his father to be murdered by the brigands?

I say the opposite in my earlier post:<br/><br/>"Minimized [situation exploration]. But of course it's still there. There's always a situation."<br/><br/>I guess, for me, if a Dogs town is a sandbox, then everything is -- I don't know what the term means anymore. Are you saying "sandboxing" is "exploring a situation" because that describes all of roleplaying, as I understand it.<br/><br/>When I think of a Dogs town, I think of a tight, focused situation that is to be addressed as the priority of play. In sandbox mode, if I find a troubled town, I have the option of (for example) just hanging out and chatting with the locals and maybe buying a deed to the local mine and trying to make some quick cash on a gold strike. The priority of play isn't situation focused, in other words, even if there is corrupt worship and such going on. If I'm sandboxing, I'm free to engage -- or not -- as I choose, or even just wander off to do something completely different. Which wouldn't be acceptable play in DitV.<br/><br/>The amusement park analogy is a good one, but I don't see a Dogs town as a whole park. Each town is rooted in one person's Pride and Sin and what falls out of that. So a town would be more like an individual ride in the park. To "sandbox" Dogs a little bit, I could see the GM setting out a map of the territories and asking the players which town they wanted to visit this week, and maybe even give them the option to ignore a town in need. But then we're edging back towards Trollbabe play anyway.<br/><br/>Does that make sense? All of roleplaying involves exploring situation(s). It's the prioritzation that matters, I think. If it's situation as first priority (Dogs style) it's not sandboxing for me.<br/><br/><b>Mark:</b> Yeah, according to the video game definition, there are no long-lasting consequences for what you do while sandboxing. Steal all the cars you want -- there will always be more, and the cops won't form a special task force to stop you (or if they do, it won't persist for the rest of the game).<br/><br/>But in roleplaying, I don't think this has to be the case. You could have your brigands scenario and still be sandboxing, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106038/#Comment_106038" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-01T12:19:42+00:00" title="November  1, 2007 12:19PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think John's right.<br/><br/>The thing about Dogs, is there's really only one way to approach it.  They have to stop the sin.  So you can have a lot of grey agendas and sandbox elements, but ultimately it's about Pride -&gt; Inustice -&gt; Sin, etc.  Sure, they can approach it by shooting the sinner in the street, brow beating people into righteous behavior, or making a doctrine call that makes the action okay in the eyes of the King.  Maybe there's more than one issue at hand.  However it's all about the Problem(s) regardless.  A Dogs game where the characters get to town, ignore the problem(s) and instead one opens a hardware store, one gets married and raise kids, and one runs out the mountain folk so they can start a farm or sell the land for a profit would break the game.<br/><br/>It would hinge on the system, of course.  You probably could do it in Sorcerer, you have a kicker and a bang, but where you go from there could be exploration (I could be off here, my only interaction was character creation for an aborted game). The issue of Humanity and the Demon is always there, but you could explore it by opening a hardware store or trying to gain personal power or whatever.  As long as it fits the premise and what the group agreed to.<br/><br/>To use a system I know better, HeroQuest, seems like a great example.  I do the same prep, NPCs with agendas, and let the players loose.  However, because of the system, their abilites drive whatever they do into a personal narrative.  HQ might not fit the "official" narrativism definition, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_106056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106056/#Comment_106056" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-01T12:36:37+00:00" title="November  1, 2007 12:36PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Please note: I'm not looking for a particular Creative Agenda to be supported.

Could you say that sandboxing is creating/supporting situation creation/emergence, but not forcing it to be resolved? That is, a sandbox Dogs game (which I can't imagine, really), would have towns, and Dogs, and when the Dogs decided that their obligations to the town they were in weren't strong enough to force them to act, you'd still have something to do? Because, as it stands, if the players in a Dogs game refused to address the town they were in, the game would grind to a halt, right?<br/><br/>Completely different question: Say you were playing some game like D&amp;D or Shadowrun. At the end of a tightly focused story arc, the group decided to keep playing in the same world they'd developed, but not the same characters or not the same time/location. Continual repetition of this reminds me of sandboxing. Does communal exploration of a defined setting while addressing the same Premise, vis a vis 'jumping around' or quantum leaping, constitute sandboxing? What about different Premises (e.g. fantasy world, first game dungeon crawl, second game political intrigue, third game mystery solvers)? What if it were a highly documented series of AP with different groups of people?<br/><br/>By the way, I'm not going anywhere in particular with this, so don't think I have an agenda. I'm just asking questions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106073/#Comment_106073" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-01T12:56:05+00:00" title="November  1, 2007 12:56PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I meant to link this before.

I think that sandboxes where there is a premise are easier sandboxes to prepare.  I also think that the videogame industry uses the term in the exact same way. <br/><br/>Grand Theft Auto is a sandbox - you basically do nothing, or commit crimes.  The sandbox is built on a premise that you will commit crimes.  You have lots of different places to commit crimes, and can commit many and varied crimes in whatever order you choose, using various elements of the environment and combining different resources in novel ways.  If I was GMing Grand Theft Auto, I know what I should prepare: Opportunities for crime and stuff that is related to crime, things that oppose crime, things that make crime easier or more difficult.

My response to myself is, its still a sandbox. Sandbox doesn't mean non-interactive. Or it shouldn't. The PCs are free to wander and tinker, but the sandbox world has an integrity of its own. Left to its own devices, the world will happen. The PCs mess with that, and it can start to happen to them. I believe this is still a sandbox they are playing in because its the same environment and they're choice of how to react to the world is not limited, provided they accept the consequences of that choice. The PCs could theoretically decide to hold their picnic lunch while the goblin king attacks. They'd be killed, of course.

If the game starts "with nothing significant coming down on the PCs" but there's secretly a giant orc army coming to attack then I think it is in the gray area at best. But if the PC's actions spark a cascade of actions they can't ignore that's still in keeping with the concept.<br/><br/>-Marco                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_106401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106401/#Comment_106401" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-03T06:19:44+00:00" title="November  3, 2007  6:19AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My experience is that many people <b>think</b> they're doing the sandbox thing, but there actually <b>is</b> a significant level of pressure inherent in the situation which is merely rendered "deniable" by framing it as a logical consequence of the initial circumstances. I suspect that this is in fact inevitable - every situation, when coupled with a set of ideas about what "reasonable consequences" look like and near-total power over deciding NPC responses to PC actions (said ideas always embedding a particular aesthetic judgment and ideological position at some level), contains the seeds of only a limited set of viable PC actions.<br/><br/>I suppose one could posit players who genuinely don't care whether the outcome of their actions are fun or interesting, and are totally willing to abandon "dead-end" games where their options have been rendered irrelevant by circumstance, but in practice I would say more than half the so-called sandbox games I have played in have either degenerated into "dead-end" states or developed a clear organizing premise as the players begin to learn which kinds of actions will be successful and which will lead to failure and stagnation.<br/><br/>In other words, I think the "sandbox" is an ideal, an El Dorado, which is aspired to but never (or very rarely) exists in practice.

in-print. Basically, you have a loosely defined setting crawling with 100 flavors of cool (or weird, depending upon your mindset), some rules for building pretty much any kind of character you can imagine, and no default premise or mode of play. Out of the box, the only ground rules are "Create what you like and have fun!" -- to me, that's Sandbox.

I suspect that this is in fact inevitable - every situation, when coupled with a set of ideas about what "reasonable consequences" look like and near-total power over deciding NPC responses to PC actions (said ideas always embedding a particular aesthetic judgment and ideological position at some level), contains the seeds of only a limited set of viable PC actions.<br/><br/>I suppose one could posit players who genuinely don't care whether the outcome of their actions are fun or interesting, and are totally willing to abandon "dead-end" games where their options have been rendered irrelevant by circumstance, but in practice I would say more than half the so-called sandbox games I have played in have either degenerated into "dead-end" states or developed a clear organizing premise as the players begin to learn which kinds of actions will be successful and which will lead to failure and stagnation.<br/><br/>In other words, I think the "sandbox" is an ideal, an El Dorado, which is aspired to but never (or very rarely) exists in practice. Eventually it either collapses into futility or incoherence or is revealed as Ouija-boarding.</blockquote>\nI think the most common counter-example to this logic is the lots-of-little-dungeons exploration game where there's a map, ruins, caverns, etc. with a fairly static town in the middle. The situation ignores the political game and the PCs simply work around various dungeon assaults and seeing what's around and where. This can be extremely fun (I've seen it done with rival adventuring teams, posted bounties for monsters, and choices of patrons which each confer different advantages and disadvantages).<br/><br/>Whether <i>anything</i> is reliably fun is, of course, up to the players. This will eventually reach a dead-end-state where everything is explored: at which point the characters can move to a new town (although since I like limited term games myself, I think the idea of saying "this will end" is actually a bonus and I don't think this is the sort of stagnation we're talking about here).<br/><br/>-Marco                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh" title="jdrakeh"><img alt="jdrakeh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/909/nZA3BEK4G6OHW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh">jdrakeh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106488/#Comment_106488" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-04T06:28:53+00:00" title="November  4, 2007  6:28AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 4, 2007 6:31AM by jdrakeh.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Max P</cite>Self-referential post.</blockquote>\nNot at all. I'm merely sharing my own anecdotal experience with Sandbox, not attempting to codify an authoritative model of Sandbox using existing game theory. The former is perfectly fine and dandy, IMHO. It's the latter that I think is self-defeating. I freely admit that what I think may not be correct. It's sad that I have to append my posts with these commonsense disclaimers but, apparently, it's necessary.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_106489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106489/#Comment_106489" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-04T06:55:40+00:00" title="November  4, 2007  6:55AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thought I called this out in my original post, but I want to stress it, because as far as I can see Marco is basically agreeing with me. The "sandbox" definition that Hargrove (jdrakeh) is working from seems eminently achievable and I've seen it work fine. Narrow franchise "you're adventurers in search of gold and glory", open details "pick your gold &amp; glory adventure from among many opportunities, each with its own flavors" = great. It's the more overarching "open franchise, open details, you can do anything" kind that I've very rarely seen give good results. Either it fragments into N individual games, often with significant friction, or it is steered back into line periodically with illusion-y or Ouija-boardy techniques, or the "open" is only <b>apparently</b> open.<br/><br/>And also - when I say "political", I'm not just talking in-fiction politics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106498/#Comment_106498" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-04T08:09:58+00:00" title="November  4, 2007  8:09AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 4, 2007 8:10AM by Max Higley.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdrakeh</cite>Out of the box, the only ground rules are "Create what you like and have fun!" -- to me, that's Sandbox.</blockquote>\nI probably misunderstood this statement.

Passive players will not enjoy the freedom to do anything.  My hypothesis is that this phenomenon (both sides of it) has to do with goal formation - active players form goals that they will pursue and thus bring themselves into contact with more and more of the sandbox.  Passive players tend to want the goal defined by the GM so they can follow along.  This leads me to wonder if there is a way to obtain a similar effect as sandbox without opening the game up to the possibility of goalless stalling.  I'm tempted to frontload as much as possible.<br/><br/>Would you still consider it a sandbox if we agreed on a setting, the players made characters, and I asked where they wanted to go and what they wanted to do before the game started?  I suspect that more active players in the group would dominate this discussion - which is OK, since the passive players don't want to be involved anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106505/#Comment_106505" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-04T08:26:29+00:00" title="November  4, 2007  8:26AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How about a game where the in-play goals were created by the players, mechanically, and the only things that happened in play were the results of seeking to accomplish those goals? Would that qualify as sandbox play?<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause that's exactly what I've done in one of my games. The only thing that detracts from the game itself being "Sandbox" if that qualifies is that a pre-defined end-game is set in place before characters are even made. The progress toward that end-game is decided by the players during play though, so if the goal creation and pursuit mechanics qualify, maybe the end-game doesn't strongly detract at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4695/how-does-one-sandbox-successfully" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4695/how-does-one-sandbox-successfully" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4695/how-does-one-sandbox-successfully/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F4695%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F4695%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
