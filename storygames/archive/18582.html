You might be defying danger to avoid getting your boots dirty, for example.  When you attack a Giant Mantis Shrimp, the tables are turned completely - you might be defying danger to avoid having your hand shattered along with your sword.<br/><br/>The GM has an opinion about the relative toughness/capability of the opposition, and this opinion affects how the narrative evolves long before the mechanics are engaged.  The mechanics are used to explore the margin - so you're totally outmatched, fine, but what exactly happens?<br/><br/>In Amber Diceless, these values are quantified.  The Kobold might have Warfare: 1, the PC Warfare: 10, and the Giant Mantis Shrimp has warfare 20.  This drives how the narrative unfolds - the shrimp has a massive advantage, and is going to win unless the player thinks of some clever way to reframe the conflict, or makes do with a lesser goal.  The range of outcomes, constrained by the karma, is explored with free-form role-play.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417821/#Comment_417821" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-05T14:51:14+00:00" title="July  5, 2013  2:51PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with your basic premise.
