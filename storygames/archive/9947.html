I've got my focus, I'm ready to go.<br/><br/>Thing is, I'm kinda gunshy on the d6 system these days. Back in the 90s, it was absolutely my go-to system. I ran everything from Star Wars to fantasy to Shadowrun with it. Recently, I've not had that many great experiences with it: I think it's because that, while I don't absolutely need to play totally hippie games, I need just a little something. A narrativist pick-me-up. A story-games snooter. 30ccs of patchouli oil. Whatever.<br/><br/>So, if you've played Star Wars d6 or any other d6-based game, you know what GODSEND essentially looks like: Stats, skills, etc. However, I'm looking for a few suggestions that could work with any d6 based game. I know that most of the awesome is going to boil down to hacks that are *very specific* to the kind of campaign I'm going for (in other words, to solve the specific problem I'm having), but beyond that I'm thinking that some brainstorming might shake loose new tools or ways of thinking of the game that I haven't considered before.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220897/#Comment_220897" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-27T05:46:50+00:00" title="July 27, 2009  5:46AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's some starters:<br/><br/><b>Fan Mail</b>, ala Primetime Adventures : Just import the mechanic wholesale, and when you spend one point of fanmail you get to add 2 extra dice to any roll (that makes it more powerful than adding a simple 1d6, but less powerful than the Force Point style "double your dice" effect).<br/><br/><b>Wick-hack</b>: Somewhere back in the 90s or early 2000s, before Orkworld, John Wick was talking about hacking a d6-based game, specifically in regards to faith. "When you are doing something that relies directly upon your faith, you get to roll all d8s instead of d6es". Sure, that makes the game less "pure d6", but I don't care, it's a cool idea.<br/><br/><b>Andy's Matrix Hack</b>: Based on that suggestion, in the late 90s/early 2000s I came up with a Matrix-style hack (inspired by the first movie, where Agents were always more powerful, and Humans could "break the rules"): The powerful antagonists in the game ("Agents", or whatever your campaign equivalent is) always rolls d10s instead of d6es for each roll, but otherwise they have the same general skills and stats as the PCs (They'll have Dexterity 5D, not Dexterity 10D... they'll just be rolling d10s). But the PCs have those "force points" (or equivalent) which lets them double their D6 die pool for one turn. You could pretty much do the same thing with like Earthdawn: Where horrors roll d10s or d12s (dried worm men, etc) or up to d20s (Verjigorm).<br/><br/><b>Spiritual Attributes</b>, ala Riddle of Steel: 5 additional emotions, goals, etc rated at 1D to 5D max (10D total spread across them); if that element/emotion/goal comes up in play, you add those dice to your roll. Simple and fitting with D6, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220971/#Comment_220971" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-27T11:20:03+00:00" title="July 27, 2009 11:20AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite><b>Spiritual Attributes</b>, ala Riddle of Steel: 5 additional emotions, goals, etc rated at 1D to 5D max (10D total spread across them); if that element/emotion/goal comes up in play, you add those dice to your roll. </blockquote>\nI like this one, especially because it seems like a neat little hack that would fit any system that lacks those kinds of mechanics. Just change the dice ratings around to reflect the specific system, and maybe to weight the emotions/goals/traits/etc for your specific game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Denys" title="Denys"><img alt="Denys" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j128/iannoble/elf-pic.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Denys">Denys</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221173/#Comment_221173" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-28T12:22:20+00:00" title="July 28, 2009 12:22PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy -- those are some great suggestions and I agree with u about D6.

On a 6 you got to re-roll it and add the result (and keep going if you kept getting 6's). On a 1 the result was a fumble, regardless of the total of the other dice. It pushed our game towards comedy and slapstick since no matter what your skill level, there was always a 1 in 6 chance things would go horrendously wrong. e.g. once the ship pilot rolled amazingly on a check for evasive maneuvers but got a 1 on the Wild die, so the GM ruled that he was so into it he managed to break off the throttle handle. (Also, everyone else had to make a check to keep their footing and my character got a 1 on the Wild die and the GM ruled she fell in the toilet. Head first. *sigh*)<br/><br/>Using something like the Wild die mechanic is a simple way to add more outcomes than just success/failure to the system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221285/#Comment_221285" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-28T20:17:21+00:00" title="July 28, 2009  8:17PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Selene Tan</cite>Using something like the Wild die mechanic is a simple way to add more outcomes than just success/failure to the system.</blockquote>\nAnd if you want to keep it from becoming slapstick, you can just ensure that it's toned back a step or two: instead of a fumble, your character gains a relationship (a la <i>Dogs</i>) or an NPC becomes hostile (a la <i>Burning *</i>) or something goes wrong that requires a follow-up test, or narrative rights shift, or, well, something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
