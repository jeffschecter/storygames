I'll feel restless and sleep only in fits and starts as I review aspects of the system or story-world in my head, usually the same aspects over and over again, like a broken record. Increasingly as the night wears on, these aspects will become distorted and combined with half-waking dreams, guided only by the logic of the unconscious. Inevitably the next morning I wake up feeling unsatisfied and anxious until I shake off the night and start my day. This has happened with D&amp;D 4E, Mouse Guard, Burning Wheel, Apocalypse World and Dunegon World, Lady Blackbird... apparently it's system-agnostic.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am prone to insomnia once in a while, but this is a very particular kind of insomnia. The closest analogy I can think of is having a fragment of song stuck in my head - it's like I get the game itself stuck in my head. Super weird. Has anyone else had this awful, Lovecraftian (but also pretty hilarious objectively speaking) experience?<br/>\n<br/>\n(The solution, obviously, is no RPGs before bedtime, but it's so hard to resist!)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344000/#Comment_344000" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-26T08:36:30+00:00" title="September 26, 2011  8:36AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I get into a place where I'm thinking sorta obsessively about a game, then yeah, it's terrible for my sleep.

I know that sounds so obvious as to be laughable and ignorable. But it's really not.<br/><br/>I know tons of people who say "caffeine doesn't really affect me. I can drink it right before bed. blah blah blah". But if it didn't affect them, they wouldn't be drinking it at all, right? I mean, coffee doesn't taste THAT good, no matter how well you make it. They're just so overly cranked up on the stuff that their body still needs to crash even with it.<br/><br/>As I age and pay attention to my body trends more (as you get older, you actually do notice your bowel cycles more, for example. It's really weird, but it happens) I can see the effect that stimulants have on my sleep patterns more clearly. If I'm having trouble getting sleep, I can usually trace it to an extra can of soda or something that I had during the day.<br/><br/>And to tie it back to what you were saying, I find that when I've over done my level of stimulants for the day, I tend to engage with things more deeply near bedtime - reading or playing video games or prepping an RPG campaign. Things that I might spend a half hour on and then be done and ready to let go for the night suddenly seem much more engaging and I focus on them much more deeply. So when I do head for bed, I've still got them floating around in my mind.<br/><br/>The majority of people who have trouble with insomnia actually injest more stimulants in a day than their body can handle, just like the majority of people with weight issues injest more calories a day than their body can handle given their activity level, metabolism, muscle mass, etc.<br/><br/>Treat your stimulants like you would a good diet (not a crappy fad diet). The most important thing you can do is carefully track your intake and see if you can slowly reduce it over time and get good results. If you're taking in more than 200mg of caffeine a day (2 small cups of regular coffee or 3 Mountain Dew or 4 cans of cola) then you're taking in a LOT. And the headaches you get when you don't consume enough are withdrawl symptoms that can be managed by tapering slowly over time.<br/><br/>Sorry if it sounds like I'm trying to threadjack. I honestly don't think that most insomnia comes from having too many thoughts in your head, but from too many stimulants. And I'm not trying to sound like some hippy health nut, cause I'm not. I just finished my morning coffee, which I drink every day. I just don't drink 4 of them any more, like I did in college, when I used to regularly stay up til dawn.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344021/#Comment_344021" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-26T10:48:26+00:00" title="September 26, 2011 10:48AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 26, 2011 10:53AM by Felan.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ha!
