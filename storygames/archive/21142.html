I was directed by a member to answer your valid questions, Rafu. I am the one who designed the rules of the game, but The Creativity Hub, makers of Rory's Story Cubes, is currently developing the physical product. (NOTE: To be clear, I'm <i>honestly</i> not the OP in disguise to get attention. The game is already funded on KS, but a fellow NYer told me to jump in.)<br/><br/><i>Untold: Adventures Await</i> is the customizable storytelling game powered by Rory's Story Cubes that makes the players the heroes. Is it a roleplaying game? Traditionally speaking, not quite, and even <i>I</i> wouldn't try to sell it that way.<br/><br/><b>How does it differ from Fate and Primetime Adventures?</b><br/>Untold (which I didn't name) features a board upon which five (out of 30) tiles will be progressively placed, each representing the 5 movements of popular media plot lines. There are over 7,000 combinations of plot lines.<br/><br/>The "customized" part of the game is rooted in the 9 Story Cubes chosen at the beginning of play to "direct" the action. One (it's solo, too) or more players will experience a very different game if they go with the original Cubes included in the box than if they used, say, Dr. Who Story Cubes.<br/><br/>The game utilizes Inspiration and Capturing Strategies to create the unique experience of making players be BOTH storyteller and audience simultaneously as they play the game. The "heavy lifting" of storytelling - that is, all the left brain stuff including structuring, tie-backs, revelations, etc. - is supported by the Scene Cards (tiles) and their deliberate color patterns to allow more freedom for the stimulation of right brain creativity.<br/><br/><b>This is a NO-prep game</b> - the <i>emergent</i> narrative takes place as the game proceeds with questions answered by Story Cubes and actions resolved by Reaction Cards (to be explicit: resolved <i>without</i> math. No numbers in this game).<br/><br/>The game plays in an hour; players are actors and spectators of the episode. <b>Again, NO prep.</b><br/><br/>Is this game for everyone? <i>Definitely not.</i> Many story game veterans may find it unappealing for a variety of reasons.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Virginian_John" title="Virginian_John"><img alt="Virginian_John" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/601/nK0KBJPN6LXY5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Virginian_John">Virginian_John</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463498/#Comment_463498" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-21T22:39:25+00:00" title="May 21, 2017 10:39PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            @ Rafu ,<br/>I did a review once for a game.

Taking turns in the traditional sense isn't necessary as group collaboration runs smoothly, first via base simple sentences (made from tile and cube icons) that are then contextually built upon with <i>shared </i>questioning allowances. (Everyone agrees upon what they want to know about, then the group asks a question to the Story Cubes, up to the per-scene maximum.) This is followed by actions taken - as the group sees fit - during the Danger, Confrontation, and Showdown scenes.<br/><br/>A complete game (episode) takes just 60 minutes.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463511/#Comment_463511" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-22T07:24:02+00:00" title="May 22, 2017  7:24AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey there! <a href="/forums/profile/Virginian_John">@Virginian_John</a> I have <i>also</i> looked at the KS page, and <a href="/forums/profile/johnfiore">@johnfiore</a> I really appreciate the explanation.

There is a "Hero Sheet" that is filled out <i>after </i>the first game has already started and the DANGER Scene has been established. In that way, players can tailor their Hero to face the opening threats (but don't worry  - the following INTRIGUE Scene could confound those tailored choices quite amusingly).<br/><br/>A Hero's characteristics include the usual RPG-ish stuff - name, role or job, personal aim, home, plus two of the following: an amazing ability or power, a helpful item, or an area of expertise (each of which may be impaired, damaged, lost, or stolen during play). There are no stats; players go along with the spirit of the world they are in and must agree with one another's descriptive choices. These characteristics provide the justifications for actions that Heroes can take later. Playing more games with the same Hero will grant new attributes later, some of which can be taken from things recorded on the Adventure Journal, like a found artifact or a scientific discovery or Jerry the Rat (a sidekick from a 9 year-old playtester's super-heroic animals game). \n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" rel="nofollow">BeePeeGee</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><a href="/forums/profile/johnfiore">@johnfiore</a>, you are the 9Qs guy, right?

If you really are interested, wait until the KS is nearly over to see if any of the stretch goals make it worth having a duplicate set of Original. I am not running the KS, so I actually don't know what the stretch goals are except for the free Batman set that has already been mentioned.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer" title="Dreamer"><img alt="Dreamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer">Dreamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463515/#Comment_463515" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-22T10:37:32+00:00" title="May 22, 2017 10:37AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I believe there is a free print and play of the current version posted on the KS, if anyone wants to take it for a spin.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnfiore" title="johnfiore"><img alt="johnfiore" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnfiore">johnfiore</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463516/#Comment_463516" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-22T11:06:31+00:00" title="May 22, 2017 11:06AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, there's a free PnP on the KS page under one of the updates.

The <b>color rule</b> is tragically missing from this document. The game will play as intended if you replace the entire CONFRONTATION section of the rules with the following:<br/><br/><i>In the Confrontation Scene, your heroes travel to a new location to deal with the Intrigue that was unveiled in the last scene. Here, they either meet a new threat or are challenged by a previous foe who directly opposes their mission.

To do this, remove any StoryCube from its square on a previous Scene Card and, without changing its icon, place it on the current Scene Card on a square that contains a colour matching any colour from the original square.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer" title="Dreamer"><img alt="Dreamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer">Dreamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463747/#Comment_463747" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-07T17:59:51+00:00" title="June  7, 2017  5:59PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bump: <a href="https://spielen.trillitzsch.net/2017/06/07/untold---adventure-awaits/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://spielen.trillitzsch.net/2017/06/07/untold---adventure-awaits/</a><br/><br/>Just thought this article was interesting in that it places the game more under the camp of indie games like Archipielago 3 and Primetime Adventures than it does under more traditional rpgs.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
