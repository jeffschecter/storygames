                    You all know what happened with Battlestar Galacrica.  That corny period-piece got not only a facelift, but an entire re-imagination almost from scratch. Most of the character names were the same, and the Cylon Threat remained, but after that it was basically put through some really creative gymnastics, and what emerged was awesome, pure awesome. Well, much of that is the screenwriting and direction, but still, you get my point.<br/><br/>I was thinking that maybe the same can be done to old D&amp;D (or other) campaign worlds. Take the core ideas that are there, and shake them up. Reimagine them.<br/><br/>What I'm thinking is that, if you're tangentially familiar with the setting, that we get a brainstorm session together to think of some things that would awesome-ify the Dragonlance setting. Just list some ideas or statements out. You do not have to build upon yourself or any other ideas (but you can if you want); you are absolutely free to contradict or ignore them. Even in your own post, you are free to contradict yourself (or build upon yourself). It's not group setting building, it's simply brainstorming.<br/><br/>(eventually, I want to do the same for Dark Sun, but I figured I'd throw up Dragonlance first to see what happens. Also, because of the excitement of the upcoming Dragonlance movie, and because Dragonlance is so sissy and eighties and teener, it totally needs to be nuked from orbit with some sizzling Awesome)                </div>

                            Dragons are not sentient. Rather, they are about as intelligent as dogs, and while domesticated, they have to be tamed.<br/><br/>Dragonlances are actually Rail Guns.<br/><br/>There is a superior cult/sect of Dragonlance Panzers, completely female dominated. They're like special ops or the NAVY SEALs of Dragonlance.<br/><br/>Dragons in Dragonlance are actually magical shape-shifting humans, the dragon is just a natural form that is the junction of the Easiest and Most Powerful form to transform into.<br/>* perhaps building on this, the rider is also a shape-shifter, and they often switch positions<br/>* they also maintain a strong sexual dynamic through the partnership<br/><br/>The evil god Takhesis isn't really Evil, but rather "different". There's no particular Good or Evil gods, though there are gods. (I'm thinking Artesia here)<br/><br/>No one knows why Raistlin Majere is sick and has such powerful magic. In fact, Raistlin himself doesn't remember, but occasionally has traumatic flashbacks.<br/><br/>Magic produces no glamorous/flashy effects, but is rather all meditative and psychic and stuff.                        </div>

                            A couple more (again, not building on anything)<br/><br/>Dragons have human intelligence, but half serpent as well (so thought is slow, speech is hard, etc. Typical lizard-man stuff): Humans turn into Dragons, there are no natural dragons. The turning is an affliction, and while dragons are respected and honored, the affliction is feared and people view it with horror.<br/><br/>Takhesis and the armies won, the good humans and all have retreated to a chain of flying islands/citadels linked together where they plan to retake the world against the odds.<br/><br/>There are no kender.<br/><br/>There are kender, but they are both curious/childlike and surprisingly hyper-intelligent (like autistic math geniuses or mentat assassins)<br/><br/>The world of Dragonlance is actually two moons locked in a binary orbit surrounding an oxygen-rich gas giant. The dragon-wars are fought between these two moons, and the dragons fly between the moons or the upper atmosphere of the gas giant.<br/><br/>There are more sides than "good vs evil". Perhaps just 5 nations at war. More of a political tale than a good-vs-evil tale                        </div>

                            The two brothers (Raistlin and Caramon) are actually one person with two personalities that are aware of each other. He's in some position of power.<br/><br/>The Wandering Que Shu are a very nearly human band of telepathic mystics with a large almost cultish following.<br/><br/>Up the post-apocalyptic feel. Dragons are mutant animals, dragonlances are the few remaing mid-range weapons. The tech and knowledge of making missiles and maintaining dragonlances is slowly being lost, or carefully tended, or has become a religion.                        </div>

                            Neat idea.<br/>
<br/>
Switch "post-apocalypse" for "apocalypse".<br/>
<br/>
Instead of Mad Max, think WWI + WWII.  Cities under siege and burning.  The Battle of England, Stalingrad, etc. Smaller Dragons  for aircraft, massive Land Dragons for tanks / sieges.<br/>
<br/>
Make it "darker" -- get rid of silly Kender, silly Gully Dwarves, and silly Gnomes.  Any important characters (I can't remember any of their names) can become humans instead.<br/>
<br/>
There are no good dragons.  The good guys need to use horses or hippogriffs against the dragons (using Dragon Lances).<br/>
<br/>
More variety of monsters on the battlefield.  The horror of trench warfare + gelatinous cubes.<br/>
<br/>
There are no elven armies -- they're all in the West across the ocean... but maybe they'll show up towards the end of the war... ;-)<br/>
<br/>
The dragon-men aren't created from good dragon egss -- they're prisoners from the places the dragon armies have already conquered. (Chronicles of Riddick / Night of the Living Dead style)<br/>
<br/>
Make alignment less obvious + overt.  Only 1 school of magic with black robes.<br/>
<br/>
Clerics didn't leave and return -- they're currently leaving -- as there are so few people with faith left.<br/>
<br/>
The twins were part of a magical experiment to create perfect mage/warriors.<br/>
<br/>
Magical experiments to create battlefield monsters accounts for the weird stuff like Owlbears and so on.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the dwarves can start bringing in some steam-punk robots + rifles to even things up -- but it should feel overwhelmingly in the dragon armies favour.<br/>
<br/>
...<br/>
<br/>
I think if you switched "post-apocalypse" for "western" you'd create a pretty neat world as well.                        </div>

                            When they said that the dragons were gone for ever, they were right, and they never came back. So why do the conquerors call themselves "dragon Lords" ...?<br>

                            There is one Dragon-Man (Drahkhen??) for each human. Likewise with the other varieties of the Dragon-men and the demi-humans. They live on the opposite planets orbiting the gas giant. The two planets mirror each other this way but with a lag of one year. A person who journeys to the other planet and finds the dragon-man or human that corresponds to himself will see what he will be doing one year from the day or what he did a year ago.                        </div>

Griffons are rare and belong only to the elite guards of a few powerful people.  Hipogriffs are widely considered extinct, but rumor has it they've just retreated to an arctic mountain range...                        </div>

                            Some pretty cool ideas here.  Bringing back the memories...<br>
<br>
What I most remember about Dragonlance:<br>
<br>
* big, world-shaping events<br>
* my annoyance at the moral typecasting<br>
* civilization in ruins, lots of relics and artifacts laying around<br>
<br>
I also remember lots of color, and a couple specific events:<br>
<br>
* Raistlin's power curve<br>
* all those dramatic, elemental, mythic places<br>
* constant talking about the gods this, the gods that<br>
* Sturm's sacrifice<br>
* kender as misunderstood<br>
* magic as possession (Fistandantalus)<br>
<br>
How could we do a BSG-like twist?   A few ideas...<br>
<br>
* If Raistlin is an NPC, we simply MUST make the character female.<br>
* Kender: just another name for teenagers.<br>
* Humans: everyone's a human, there are just lots of cultures.<br>
* Cataclysm with teeth: make the cataclysm hundreds of years ago, and make humanity on this once-dominant continent on the verge of annihilation.  Plagues, famines, infighting and wars which never stop.  Never enough people to do much more than subsist, and engage in petty squabbles.<br>
* Lots of distortion about the old civilization, lots of odd taboos.<br>
* More on the old civlization: it would be interesting if the previous civilization knew that it was going to fall before it did, and so they hid stuff, and built things to instruct or possibly warn successor peoples of things.<br/>
* Invaders are from another part of the world.  Another continent?  They should be very few in number (initially), but have far superior technology, which they use to destroy villages and cities.  Perhaps their ships are called "dragonlances", and the storyline revolves around the seeking out of dragonlances of our own.   They aren't all here to conquer, however.  They're here to search for stuff.<br/>
* I like the image of a whole ancient magical tower totally vacant, save for one remaining wizard in dark robes.  So let's do it:  magic is exceedingly rare, and it's not fireballs and lightning bolts.  It is dark, dire magic, as in CoC.  Rituals, sacrifices, and terrible deeds.  A few towers are left, and there are just a few more wizards than there are towers, so some wander around. <br/>
<br/>
Hmm!<br/>
<br/>

                            Just a single measly contribution:<br/><br/>Kender are the results of magical experiments (oh, to darken it up, let's say by the black robers) who were designed to spread out over civilization and bring back valuable objects to their dark masters.  <br/><br/>While the experiment was largely a miserable failure (kenders want everything, not just valuables; they suck at returning home), there are occasions when a kender's 'core mission' kicks in--then they get real scary, real amoral, real focused.

If that wasn't bad enough, one kender going rogue tends to cause other kender to go rogue, forming little packs of scariness.                        </div>

Man, that suggestion had the "ding!" moment for me!<br/><br/>Some more thoughts inspired by this, kind of stream of consciousness.<br/><br/>Each ship/submarine has to be captained by a Wizard, because only one of magical nature can track a Dragon.  The Lighthouses get a fix on a rough position and the Dragonlance sets sail, each with their own crazy "Mage-Captain Ahab".<br/><br/>The dragons are a threat, but only in a primal, force of nature type way.  They're not good or evil... they're just big and powerful and magical too.  Sometimes they overturn ships and eat the crew.  Sometimes they raid the coastal towns.  Sometimes, only sometimes, they have been known to help certain shipwrecked sailors to shore.  Without fail, they alone of the crew will have survived, the rest being eaten by the dragon of course.   These dragon-touched individuals are viewed with awed suspicion by most, and are thought to be either cursed or blessed.  Many Mage-Captains consider it good luck to have such an individual on board as they are clearly protected by the dragons.  Others view them as a curse, such folks are clearly in league with the creature that spared them, and will only lead the Dragonlance into a trap.<br/><br/>If you're wearing boots of dragonscale, it's said you can't drown.  But it's terrible hard to work the scale of a dragon, so such items are rare and highly sought after.<br/><br/>It's a hard and dangerous life crewing a Dragonlance, but the rewards can be great.  Crewmen sign on for a share of the dragon.  Perhaps 1/100 of the scale, 1/50 of the meat for your average sailor.  Only the Mage-Captain and the First Mate get a share in the blood.<br/><br/>The original never did it for me at all, but I want to play <i>this</i> Dragonlance!<br/><br/>Thanks Meg!<br/><br/><br/>Drew                        </div>

<i>A Spellbubbler? </i><br/><br/>Okay, now, I thought we were trying to go for the awesome and not the silly ; )<br/><br/>Now all I can think of is salty old wizards with magic pipes that blow bubbles (with popeye theme music).<br/><br/>Back to topic:<br/><br/>I really like the dragon touched--I can see a whole little story arc unfolding with a dragon-touched character trying to hide their past, only to have it come come up in some really cool dramatic way.

                            I love and hate this thread. I love it because I've been mulling over THIS EXACT TOPIC for a couple of weeks now, with exactly the same inspiration: could one reboot or revamp Dragonlance in the manner of Battlestar Galactica, scraping off the fromage and (re)discovering the coolness?  I hate it because that's all I've been doing, mulling, and now I have to actually sit down and type stuff out. Well, "have to" is a little strong, but what geek can resist the siren call of returning to a guilty old pleasure and squeezing new awesomeness out of it? (See also the <a href="http://bztv.typepad.com/newsviews/files/ST2004Reboot.pdf" rel="nofollow">Star Trek reboot</a> (PDF link) that's been going around.) I curse/kiss you, Andy. <br/><br/>Lots of good stuff here already, but I'm going to take Andy at his word that we can contradict or ignore the statements of ourselves and others. Lemme see:<br/><br/><b>Start with the modules, not the books.</b><br/>Thereâ€™s a lot of content in the modules that is cool but unfamiliar: the cursed tomb of the archlich Fistandantilus in DL3 creeped my players right out - I dare them to deny it. Then there was the underground dwarf kingdom of Thorbardin with its crazy modular map system and floating fortress tombs. And oh my god, DL 12, which was totally psycho â€“ it had about 50 supporting characters all with their own implied subplots, groovy girl assassins and Fewmaster Toede's obese dragon and  noble minotaur pirates, and like 15 mini-dungeons, and it all culminated in the heroes getting sucked down to the bottom of the ocean, to the sunken Romanesque city of Istar, with sexy green aquaelves and sahaugin driving underwater freaking chariots, and they fought a giant miniatures battle there against, letâ€™s not mince words, Great Cthulhu. My point? Just that there's a lot of crazy stuff in the modules that is only sort of part of DL canon. If you use those a playground rather than a script, letting the PCs go where they will, wandering the map, youâ€™ll never be wanting for weird shit.<br/><br/><b>Everyone gets to be Raistlin</b><br/>What I mean is: nobody is stuck on the plot railroad. Every PC has their baggage and their secrets and their agenda, and they all get to make big choices and the fate of the world is in anyone's hands. Riffing on the BSG reboot, I think I might have each character take just the name of an original hero of the Lance and construct their own whole Kicker from that. <br/><br/><b>Post-Apocalypse</b><br/>I'm with Meg - I'd play up the post-apocalypse angle. It's something the early modules play up that gets forgotten later: Krynn is a post-apocalypse setting. In those early adventures, the Cataclysm was ever present, but its nature hadn't clearly been specified. Xak Tsaroth, the shattered, sunken city in DL1, is full of ghosts, all trapped doing whatever they were doing at the moment the Big One hit. They made me think of those flash-fried Hiroshima shadows. In DL3, I think thereâ€™s some implication that the cursed tomb of Fistandantilus is radioactive or something. Or maybe I just made that up. Either way, the Cataclysm and pre-Cataclysm Krynn should be spooky scary shit. The ancients Knew too Much. They angered the gods, who basically roasted civilization. That is hot, and should be front and center in any DL reboot.<br/><br/>So I think I would up the tech level of pre-Cataclysm Krynn and drop the tech level of post-Cataclysm Krynn. Make it less Middle Earth Light, more Hyperborea. Even before the dragons start making trouble, Krynn is a land on whom Night Has Fallen. Our heroes are not sensitive new age elf boys but grim barbarians stalking the wasteland, ekeing out a rough life in the radioactive graveyard of a dead civilization whose infernal engines confuse and frighten them. Our story is to the story chronicled by Hickman and Weis and illustrated by Elmore as the gritty historical Arthur is to Malloryâ€™s romantic Camelot. <br/><br/>I say "radioactive", but I'm just being figurative. I wouldn't make the pre-Cataclysm tech literal modern day atomic stuff. I'm thinking more like the baroque magi-science in China Mieville's Perdido Street Station. So we've got Conanâ€™s Hyperborea in the ruins of Mievilleâ€™s New Crobuzon. Places like Xak Tsaroth should be scary as hell. (And yeah, that means No Gully Dwarves.) They should be like the Bad Places in Mike Mignola comics: black science and infernal machines and terrible secrets of the past. When the PCs find a crazy witch woman howling in the wasteland about the Old Gods (ie, Goldmoon), they should be split on whether to join her or burn her at the stake. <br/><br/>[whoa - my comment is too long! cut here]                        </div>

                            More: <br/><br/><b>Reveals?</b><br/>Dragonlance is a world with secrets. I respect the old DL series for trying to set up secrets and big reveals, but they almost all misfired in play. Ooh, the Draconians are made from dragon eggs, big shocker. You canâ€™t start a series by saying â€œthis is just like a regular D&amp;D world except there are no dragons and no clerics," and then expect big gasps of surprise when the very first adventure features a dragon and a cleric. So the rebooted Dragonlance ought to have some dark secrets and big reveals, but I don't know what they are yet.<br/><br/><b>Dragons</b><br/>A couple of people have alluded to this: If you're playing Dragonlance, dragons have to be way cool. Some of you have said, they're ferocious, animalistic, forces of nature - and that's cool - but what if they're like freaky, alien ferocious. In fact, what if they're kind of like the Alien Queen in Aliens - perfect killing machines, all acidic blood and glistening retractable jaws and sinuous psycho-sexual H.R. Giger bodies?<br/><br/><b>The Old Gods</b><br/>The Gods destroyed the world, then disappeared. Now they want to come back. Is that such a good thing?                        </div>

                            Still more:<br/><br/>I got it. It's a CHARNEL GODS game. The characters are Sorcerers, with kickers, that whole deal. Except instead of Fell Weapons as Demons, each "Sorcerer" is bound to a Dragon. Dragons are the Fell Weapons. (This way, every PC gets a dragon, which is awesome. It never seemed fair that almost every single NPC in Krynn had a pet dragon - even the hobgoblin Toede gets one by the end - but the PCs get to take like one ride on a dragon in DL9.) Dragons are the only thing that can stop the return of the Old Gods. But at what cost?                        </div>

Rob -- some cool ideas there.  A grittier mignola style post-apocalypse is right on.<br/>
<br/>
Reveal -- after the first few adventures the players learn that Cure Light Wounds spells, and all those cool pre-apocalyptic magic items... they eventually turn you into  a Dragon Man.  Nya-haha.                        </div>

Dragonlances are in fact a new <i>philosophy</i>.  The whole situation distills down to sacred warring against secular.<br/>

In hindsight, this could actually be pre-cataclysm Krynn, and the Krynn we know could have just gotten the whole "history" wrong.                        </div>

                            I can't remember where I saw it, but there is a game somewhere where you are an historical character, like Julius Caesar or Abraham Lincoln or someone.

<blockquote>Switch "post-apocalypse" for "apocalypse"...Cities under siege and burning...</blockquote>
<blockquote>The dragons are the Cataclysm, and it's happening now.</blockquote>
the dragon armies are the apocalypse and it is happening now.  They have belched forth a swath of destruction across Krynn and nothing can stop them.
<blockquote>There are no good dragons.  The good guys need to use horses or hippogriffs against the dragons...</blockquote>
nano-fic: the good guys.. don't get me started on the good guys. oh, they'll fight their noble fight until the end comes sure enough, the vainglorious fools.  hippogriffs don't graze on grass, do they?  common people starving in their hundreds and thousands, fields razed, stores used up and the good guys seize whatever livestock they find--whatever can't be hidden away when they come through--to feed their filthy hippogriffs so some up-jumped jackanapes can get himself gloriously roasted in a rain of dragon's fire.
<blockquote>Clerics didn't leave and return...</blockquote>
they're a despised sect of mystics and letter-counters who still worship the dead gods.  they hold the secret to a power that can stop the dragon armies, but they don't know it.  it's encoded in their holy books--much is encoded in their holy books, if one but knows the key.  their prophecy speaks of one who will come, one who will fall and rise again, one with a green stone in his chest.<br><br>the dragonlance is the cataclysm.                        </br></br></div>

                            So my buddy and I have actually started this game in Mortal Coil.<br>
<br>
In fact I cross posted this on the Planescape thread because it has a strong relationship to both.<br>
<br/>
So this happens after the War of Souls.  Our characters, in a previous traditional campaign, bring back the gods of Krynn after finding out that Tahkisis actually stole the world instead of the gods abandoning them.  As such our involvement mad eus mini-gods.  When the gods came back they said thanks and here's your hat.  There isn't enough room for you here.  They transferred our city to the Astral Plane and now we are gods trying to find a home.<br/>
<br/>
We just had our first session where we established our gods (defined by three domains a name and a holy symbol).  Then we created Mortal Coil characters as the avatars of those gods.<br/>
<br/>
It was cool becasue some of us made very down to earth people while others made magical disconnects - more embodiments of the diety.  And we've been told that if we do not meet the needs of our godly selves that the god may make other avatars to meet those needs - possible competetors?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, so far so good.                        </br></br></br></div>

                            How about making the Cataclysm a plague or epidemic that still swirls around occasionally throughout the later ages.  Now the gods and the dragons are all there, but the dragons become a precious commodity.  Not only are they military weapons, but their blood is a cure to the Kingpriest Plague.  Now you have people using dragonlances not only to defend against evil dragons and dragon riders, but also to retrieve life-saving dragon blood.  This could also be a rationale for breeding dragons, beyond riding them, to offset the major risks of dragon-rearing by having a dual purpose.  Now you have dragons as a scarce commodity with two potential uses - military conquest or plague fighting.  Of course, the dragons have to die to produce the plague elixir.  The plus side is that it makes enough for a small village.                        </div>
