<a href="http://craniumrats.pbwiki.com" rel="nofollow">Cranium Rats</a> is still at Beta 3.0, awaiting external playtesting. Things are slowly picking up for me again as I slowly but surely increase the circle of people who have read it and provide feedback, albeit privately.<br/><br/>It's a game where you don't play the characters, but different Aspects within them that use them like puppets, on their gambit for control. Highly competitive, very pacing-centered.                        </div>

                            1st Quest is seriously stalled.  Both groups that were playing it have fallen this way and that due to real life scheduling stuff.<br/><br/>And I am really enjoying writing fiction right now, a treat I promised myself once I got Dictionary of Mu out into the world.<br/><br/>I tossed up a blurb for Dreamation and will run a game just to keep my finger on the pulse and play with making con scenarios for the game.<br/><br/>I still have hopes of getting it out for Gen Con next year.

                            I literally had a dream on Tuesday morning where I was excitedly drawing a game board with four spaces on it - the Main Hall, on which I drew a crown; the Hall of Students (which I wrote in REALLY BIG LETTERS); the Meat-Cutting Department; and the Garden. Then I woke up and couldn't remember anything else, if there even was anything else. But by the end of the day on Wednesday, I had a game draft that looks, as I think Jason said about my owlbear game, "weirdly playable." So, yeah, 5%.<br/><br/>That owlbear game? It's been torn down and half-rebuilt completely differently once. The second time may happen this weekend.<br/><br/>Nobody was wondering about my games, but hey.                        </div>

                            I'm working on a game tentativly titled "Sweet Agatha." It's been in development since gen con. it will be available at dexcon (in all likelyhood). It is in its earlier stages presently, as i both write it and look for some money to pay for crazy things that games shouldn't have to worry about (location shoots, models, fashion houses in-stores). <br/><br/>i'll say 25% done.                        </div>

                            The Imp Of The Perverse is almost ready to be birthed. I have the broad outlines, time to fill in the basics (y'know, rules and stuff). Conceptually it's at about 75%, actual readiness closer to 5%. It's my gothic horror/Edgar Allen Poe short story game.<br/><br/>I have a game called Fracture thats also been in the works since Gen Con and should also be ready for DexCon. I need to finish it and see if it's playtestible (logistically....it may cost a good amount to get it into physical readiness for playtest). I'd say 25%, and I may have a draft at Dreamation. Maybe.                        </div>

                            Hi!<br/>
  Legends of Lanasia is prolly 90% done. I need a good edit and art. I have a line on both, but this stage is going REAL slooooowly...<br/>
  I don't have the first clue how to market it and I'm not sure if anyone will be interested in playing it, but I'm more than willing to give it a shot. After all, the playtests have gone real well!<br/>

                            An attempt at playtesting my diceless LARP system <u>Ends and Means</u> fizzled early this year, but one of my playtesters fell in love with it. She has adapted a game setting of her design to my system, and she's pulling together a huge number of LARPers she knows in order to launch a new playtest. We begin the new playtests in January.<br/>

I've never done this before, so I don't know about a percentage. This draft of the text itself is 99% complete (literally... only like one page out of 110) -- but I'm sure I'll need to revise a lot after the playtesting.                        </div>

<blockquote>The Naked City (gritty post-war film noir)</blockquote>
Caesar, is this your new title for A Touch of Noir? Because if it is, I give it like 6 stars out of 4. Unreal awesome title.<br/><br/>....<br/><br/>Boulevard, my story of a punk rock tragedy and all its pathetic cast members, is approaching actually getting written on paper. My premise feels rock solid, I know what my sources are, and I'm starting to get a lot more of a "grip" on what scenes actually look like. I've figured out how guns work around the table, figured out what role settings/locations play in how a scene works, and developed some really cool ideas with repetition. I feel like once I actually start writing, it'll be ready for playtest really quickly, because once I start writing I'll have almost everything defined inside my skull.<br/><br/>....<br/><br/>Wash is a game me and Kirk Mitchell are working on. I'm not sure how much I'm allowed to say about it, but its a dark fantasy game about a world plagued by bloodlust, orcs, goblins, and Angels (read: the mutated bastard children of man). Players take on the roles of the religious elite inside a small and desperate community, and are responsible for protecting those who need to live and killing those who need to die. Oh, and slaughtering your enemies in droves, binding Angels, developing rituals of great power and magic, and ensuring the genetic purity of your tribe.<br/><br/>It's like... in the concept stage where we fight over creative control, but that's going really well. We've firmed up the roles of the different archetypes/classes in the community, how rituals/vows/decrees work, how humans mutate into Angels and what the role of marked is, and just how ugly orcs look. Everything is running beautifully according to me.<br/><br/>....<br/><br/>Although it isn't necessarily a "game" in that it might be freeform, I'm hashing out the concept for a PBP game I want to play. In short, it's about: gritty cyberpunk, love on the edges of life, street gangs, brutal beatings, queer love hidden just under the surface, robocops and arm cannons, biker gangs, anarchy, and gore.<br/><br/>When I have time and energy, I'm going to create a forum and open this game up to people.                        </div>

                            'Reel Adventures', my game about film action storytelling and confronting your nemesis, both personal and plot, is ready for its second playtest. It needs some work to get momentum and impact to work well, but this is just a number balancing issue. If you want to help out you can download the game from my <a href="http://www.iainmcallister.co.uk" rel="nofollow">website</a> under the games section.<br/><br/>I would say it is about 35-40% done.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Iain                        </div>

                            Am I the only one who has about half a dozen projects on the go? Anyway, here's the status report on the top 3!<br/><br/>Growing Pains, one of the top 6 in Reversed Engineer, is about 90% done in terms of rules and setting. I just have some villains to write up and then maybe some more examples. Artists are all tapped, but not yet commissioned. Looking at a post-christmas release.<br/><br/>Six Bullets for Vengeance, my game of bloody revenge told in reverse, is perhaps 50% done. The rules are undergoing a bit of an overhaul, and i'm introducing some sort of "revelation map" to help the flow of information. I also need to write up some sample settings so it's not just about the Western. But, the art is coming along nicely! Keith Senkowski has posted <a href="http://bob-goat.livejournal.com/102751.html" rel="nofollow">two</a> <a href="http://bob-goat.livejournal.com/102452.html" rel="nofollow">pics</a> up on his livejournal, and they're sizzling!<br/><br/>Yesterday's Tomorrow, my dystopian rpg set in a vaguely retro nuclear-powered future is coming along leaps and bounds, but is probably no more than 25% finished. I'm implementing a great deal more player empowerment and collaboration, from the in-character interrogation character creation to my "building a better dystopia" setting/city creation. It's kinda cool!<br/><br/>I'm posting design diaries for all 3 games over at the <a href="http://www.collective-endeavour.com/blog/2" rel="nofollow">Collective Endeavour</a>.                        </div>

I pretty much have a core mechanic to playtest and a bunch of other stuff either noted down or whirling around in my head but that's about it.

                            This is a great thread!  It's inspiring to see all these mad ideas.<br/><br/>Grey Ranks is 75% done and ready for playtesting.  It's my big project, a game about Polish teens during the 1944 Warsaw Uprising, and I'm currently waiting for some feedback before messing with it any more - doing some testing tomorrow.  I need to start looking for art, so if you know somebody with a strong line who does rubble, romance and nazi hardware well, let me know.<br/><br/>I <i>think </i>these two have legs but you never know:<br/><br/>Business Solutions is a little game about photocopy machine repairmen.  It's also 75% done and I think it will be fun to play, like an episode of The Office.  I stole the resolution mechanic from Contenders.  <br/><br/>Untitled Project Kilo was inspired by Cormac McCarthy's new book.  I think I've figured out how to do post-holocaust desperation (huzzah dystopia!) without stupid resource management.  20% done?  You'll want to grub for food, find warm places to sleep, not get sick, and the system supports all that in a neat way.  I stole the rest of it from TSOY and Dogs.                        </div>

<br/>
My next game (for the second year of DL-Quarterly) is caleld Saviours.  It's been drafted and revised once.  It's proabably ready for playtesting, but I'm not.  Until I get everything straitened out with the first year of DL-quarterly everythign is on hold.  For all those who haven't published a RPG yet, let me tell you, it's one of the hardest things you can ever do.<br/>

Peace,<br/>

                            My game, Afterworld, is about civilization emerging from the ashes of the apocalypse.  What emerges, what the world was like before, and what form the apocalypse took, are all up to you.<br/><br/>I hope to have a readable beta version that I can show people by Christmas.  Which means the game itself is like... I dunno, 10% done?                        </div>

                            Lordy.  I'll just stick to the games I'm likely to finish soon.<br/><br/><i>Unconquered</i> (a.k.a. The Exalted Hack) has been playtested in bits and pieces a grand total of 3-4 times, which means that all of the mechanics have been tested in isolation, but never together.  It's probably one of the most complex freeform-y games ever written and includes a bunch of new fangled mechanical ideas, so it's been slow going working all the details out.  The game text has to be completely rewritten again, but at this point I'm aiming for just getting a basic draft of the rules done and then letting the text evolve as I (and others) get more play done.  I'd say, as far as that goes, I'm about 50-60% along in getting a playable version of the game together.  Plus, I already have a beautiful cover thanks to Jennifer Rodgers.<br/><br/><i>Gridiron Gods</i> is my <i>Agon</i> hack for the setting contest, replacing ancient Greece with an insane alternate world called Planet Football.  I always said I wanted to write a sports-based game and this one is coming together pretty well.  I have a ton of notes and the beginnings of a layout, but let's call this only 10% done.  Hopefully I can get a Team Sheet draft finished this weekend.<br/><br/>Both of these projects are waiting on me finishing a bigger project for work: 20,000+ words on the subject of "Contemporary Chinese Protestantism."                        </div>

<p>Gar, I just moved and I can't talk with my usual henchmen about what I'm working on.</p>
<p>But <em>that hero game</em> just got a significant rewrite, to the point that it's in like a playable draft state maybe.</p>
<p><em>KUsanagi no Tsurugi,</em> which was going to be my setting contest thing, is fun to write about but maybe it is not a game.</p>

<i>The Committee for the Exploration of Mysteries</i> is currently slated for playtesting externally by some gracious folks, this after a couple rounds of local playtesting worked out the major kinks. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that the rules and text can generate enjoyable play outside my immediate presence. The text is probably around 60% complete, and I've secured most of the art I'll be using (though I still need a cover). I'll also be looking for someone to do layout for me. I'm still shooting for an April or May 2007 release date, and have the ad in <i>FLFS</i> to prove it.<br/><br/><i>The Big House</i>, a game of prison drama, is next on my list. I've got a kernal of the mechanics and some throughts on structuring game play using scenes as currency inspired by <i>Burning Empires</i>. There's still a hell of a lot of work left, though, so maybe 25% done at best.<br/><br/><i>Utopolis: Policing the Retrofuture</i> was my Reversed Engineer entry of mindwiped criminals who are now police detectives in a 1950s future. It's probably my <i>InSpectres</i> heartbreaker, but I am really keen on mystery/investigation games and want to see it through to completion eventually. It's probably around 20% done.                        </div>

Between games, The Devil fucks with your real life. 80% done. I need to playtest it, tweak the rules a bit, and handle layout and illustrations (if any) and probably release it as a cheap PDF.<br/><br/>In <a href="http://adam.legendary.org/index.php/Architects_of_Aztlan" rel="nofollow">Architects of Aztlan</a>, your antediluvian people caused a cycle of worldwide cataclysms. As a talented Atlantis "Architect," you reincarnate into the lives of people in the future and try to convince them to take measures to save their legacy and maybe a few bodies. 70% done. I need to playtest it, tweak the rules a fair bit I think, and get it illustrated and laid out nicely. I'd like to release it as a PDF and POD game.<br/><br/><i>Towerlands</i> is a little fantasy heartbreaker thing I'm working on.

I just started it but I have a strong idea <a href="http://adam.legendary.org/index.php/Towerlands%27_Power_19" rel="nofollow">where it's going</a>, so let's say it's 10% done.                        </div>

<em>Sons of Liberty</em>, high-action American Revolution clockworks-and-lasers craziness, is all but sketched out and ready for its proof-of-concept playtest in the next couple weeks.  It's at 5%, and assuming the playtest is at all positive, it will see the crank-out-the-prose grind that will take it through the first half of development really quickly.  I highly suspect the game will write itself.  I'm really excited.<br/><br/><em>Agora: how shall we live?</em> has been backburnered in favor of <em>SoL</em>, since I want to release the latter for election year 2008.  It's basically Alpha Centauri: the RPG, with an emphasis on the players fighting over the future character of humanity on the last world left after a devastating galactic war.  It's in holding position at 10% or so.<br/><br/><em>Sailing for Atlantis</em>, my Reversed Engineer game, is on the slow road to eventual production.  I'm not sure if it's enough to be a game on its own, and I don't have the mental space right now to consider the question in detail.  So I will eventually add in some more content and rules wrinkles or go with what's already there, so the game is either at 2% or 25%.  I'll also need to figure out how to package it with post-it notes so you can play without a trip to Office Depot.<br/><br/><em>Keystone</em> is my way-backburnered not-even-sure-if-I-want-to-do-it project.  Right now it's just some blind groping in a couple directions all at once.<br/><br/><em>Apotheosis</em>, transhumanist roleplaying in the classical world, is nothing but a twinkle in my eye at the moment, but I'm filing ideas away for eventual development.  I love me the sandalpunk.                        </div>

Oh yeah. Spin til Dawn (working title) is a game I started to write but didn't quite finish in time for MACE 2006 Iron Game Chef. It's a game of super powerful DJs that soothe public unrest and soften propaganda's harsh edge in a wartime society, eventually summoning forth a castle for the greatest rave of all of humanity. The text is about 15% complete and its never been playtested, so I'd say I'm at .99% complete.                        </div>

I'm that playtester that Adam Cerling mentioned, and it's true!  ...and I won't be content until I get the entire gaming world addicted to what I think is the best thing for gaming since Mountain Dew and Mechanical pencils!<br/>
<br/>
So, I can you can say that my project is dependent upon Adam's Project!<br/>
<br/>
So, let us reveal...tada!     Sanctum: The Fallout.<br/>
<br/>
Sanctum is a world that has endless possilbilities, versions, adaptations and creations all withou a single theme.<br/>
No matter what the storytellers create or expand upon during their own game; the fundamental is very simple.<br/>
<br/>
Core idea?   Individuals from different places in a world, from different periods in time and from different walks of life find themselves waking suddenly in a single city that combines familiar things from each and every person who is now within this city.   There are no explanations to start with, and it is a heavily social game, relying on characters to discover who they really are and what role they are going to play in this city.   Sanctum is what the city represents; a haven of sorts.   (each game has it's own answers...perhaps aliens, perhaps they were plucked from time when they would have died...maybe it's a giant zoo...this is up to the ST's when they first decide)   And Fallout, is the aftermath of what has happened...<br/>
<br/>
Our playtest is going to be ordinary people, from ordinary lives from the planet Earth.<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking forward to the beta, I've gotten some wonderful feedback on the world, and people seem excited :                        </div>

<b>Balance of Power </b>(AKA <b>The Front</b>): 3%. I finished a very rough draft of some rules, but there's a ton of handwaving in the core mechanics, and there's a few metric tons of additional play features to add later. I've had one alpha playtest so far, which was immensely useful, but it's developing slowly. It's backburnered a bit right now, as my mind is elsewhere. I'm hoping the my "political metahuman" mojo recharges over the holidays.<br><br><b>Spindrift</b>: 1%. This anime-inspired space opera just won't let me go. I want a fast-paced, dramatic (even melodramatic) game that captures the feel of better space operas. I think I have a few neat mechanical notions, especially for ship combat, but character conflict resolution is weak, the setting is sketchy, and the combat and character stuff has a trad-vs-indie clash feel right now that needs hammering out. There are a few things that I'm immensely proud of, but it's nowhere near playtestable yet, even as an alpha.<br><br><b>Gothic</b>: 1%. Backburned Victorian Gothic Romance game about handling your Internal Conflict while dealing with an External Conflict common to all the characters. Characters are members of families that exemplify one of the gothic characteristics (from Ruskin's <b>The Stones of Venice</b>), and every family has multiple secrets, one of which probably provides the context for the External Conflict. It will probably have a card element and ideally will be playable in a single session. Definitely a short-form game, it comes back around to me every once and a while, but my heart is stronger elsewhere.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            To answer this, I went back and cut from a similar thread back in may 06. <i>Updates in italics</i>. It's partly depressing/ partly hopeful to see my progress or lack thereof.<br><br>Heads of State: nine short games about tyrants is 5/9th of the way playtested. Need to try the remaining four games, edit them all, and hopefully complete in 2006. <i>games now all playtested once internally and 2 at a con; need external playtests for the other 7 + a third playtest for a few. photographs secured for art and I've done some layout experiments. Target date moving from early to mid 07</i><br><br>a first draft of Manifesto! is 80% written and needs examples of play, more quotes from real manifestos, and before and after photos of a detourned board game, perhaps from a play test. In theory this could be completed and released in some form by the end of the year. <i>Still not playtested, could be at anytime, since I bought this nerdy 'teach kids to cross the street safely' board game at a thrift store for this purpose </i><br><br>War, Beauty, and Meaning (working title), a game that classifies wars as beautiful or ugly and purposeful or nihilistic, each of the 4 combos with its own rule modifications, is perhaps 40% drafted. <i>still need to figure out how the rules shift when the game moves along the aesthetic and meaning lines. probably playtest after wine dark sea</i><br><br>Wine Dark Sea: the final voyage of Odysseus is lingering with its resolution rules now partly based on hexameter. I need to rewrite and expand a lot. <i>I hope to playtest this soon, I want to find out if the hexameter mechanic will work with players counting words on their fingers or if it needs some kind of physical counting device</i><br><br>Cage of Reason, a 2006 game chef entry, has been playtested once and I need to make the changes and write up some real enlightenment era figures as pre-made wrestlers.<i>found out that one of the newer members of our game group is a big wrestling fan so this deserves a 2nd playtest sometime</i><br><br/>Capital of the Eternal Century, my other game chef entry, is in more preliminary form and needs a lot more setting info.<i>I need to write up the simplified system I thought of post contest, this is one that probably is more to my taste than that of most folks but I'll indulgently request a playtest at some point next year</i><br/><br/>Two Francs (working title) a game of exuberant, late-medieval urbanity inspired by Francois Villon and Francois Rabelais is mainly a very long list of weird lifepaths stolen from an appendix to gargantua/pantagruel that Rabelais probably didn't write himself (ie "raving, doating churls," "hedge-whores," "tennis court-keepers boys.")<i>haven't worked on it</i><br/><br/>Cul-de-sac: the soft end of the american dream is a working title with nearly zero writing but a few ideas<i>still at 0 percent</i><br/><br/><i>joy division: a techno horror 2 pager, playtested &amp; modified a few times in one session, Joshua has a good idea for reformatting it</i><br/><br/><i>satanic mills: early Marx meets polaris: I thought it was the weakest of my three 2-page context entries but the voters liked the concept so maybe it's worth a short playtest</i><br/><br/><i>corrosion: my last 2-page entry, might be worth a try at some point</i><br/><br/><i>the best thing: reverse engineering entry on immortality in ancient china, I need to decide if I want to move this and if so, are the rules inspired by the char sheet the best fit </i> </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

I always said I wanted to write a sports-based game and this one is coming together pretty well.  I have a ton of notes and the beginnings of a layout, but let's call this only 10% done.

Huh. Jonathan, you should check out <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://scottsigler.podshow.com" rel="nofollow">Scott Sigler's podcast page</a>. He's got a serialized podcast novel called "The Rookie," which is about a human competing in the alien football leauge. Never listened to it myself, but it just seemed too similar not to mention as a possible source.<br/>
<br/>
As for my own games, I have several in various stage of design. <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.plaguemonkey.com/sl.htm" rel="nofollow">The Great Art</a> and <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.plaguemonkey.com/gt.htm" rel="nofollow">Group Therapy</a>, despite being nearly  complete, have pretty much hit mechanical brick walls that I just can't seem to knock down. I keep banging my head against them, trying to make them work the way I want them to, when something else squirts out my ears, like <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.plaguemonkey.com/unistat.pdf" rel="nofollow">Unistat</a>, which is completed.<br/>
<br/>
Two of these ear-squirter games are <i>Fulcrum</i> and <i>Rhadamani Steel</i>.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Fulcrum</i> is two games in one book. Both games focus on the issue of balance in ourselves and the world. One looks at the order/chaos divide, while the other addresses good and evil. The mechanics popped into my head nearly complete, and I've tinkered with them until they're about 90-95 percent done. I still need to draft a playtest document, playtest, rewrite, lay out, etc., so I'd call it about 40 percent finished. It'll be done when it's done.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Rhadamani Steel</i> is a sort of pseudo-European, low-fantasy/wuxia, tactical/cinematic fighty game about master swordsmen. The general idea for the mechanics is complete, but only in my head. Making it work for real is going to take a lot of work. The setting exists only vaguely, and only in my mind, so lets call this one 10 percent done.                        </div>

                            The working title is "Der Hexenwald" but it'll probably be renamed to "Wolves in the Forest" as <a href="http://wolvesintheforest.com" rel="nofollow">wolvesintheforest.com</a> was available (just registered for it, so that link will go nowhere for a good few days or so).  The game has been roughed out rather well, but there's a lot of coding to be done.  It's a web-based game with role-playing elements.  I'm about a good week or two worth of dedicated programming to get it live, but that's when I'm not doing contracting work and the upcoming holidays, so I don't expect to beta test it until early next year.                        </div>

                            The BARBAREN! design process is about 90% finished. I need to think over the results of the last playtests, make a few ammendments and then run a final playtest, and then I think the system will have found it's final form. Unfortunately, it changed quite a bit from the version represented by the 80 or so pages muscript I have. So actually <i>writing</i> the book will still be significant work.<br/>

<p>Catastrophic financial crises have put a bit of a damper on my game design progress.</p>
<p><em>The Infected</em> is maybe 50% done.  Early playtests have been awesome, but there are significant pieces missing still.  Plenty of work left to do.</p>
<p><em>Invisible Shepherds</em> is probably about 10% done.  Some of the early system work I did with it needs a serious overhaul.</p>

                            Due to a snow day at work today (yay!), I was able to scrawl out the basic of my "Dirty Secrets" game, which is a noir detective game with player-authored mysteries.  One more bit (that I can probably improvise for now), and I should have a playable alpha.

                            I'm under 50% done (approximately) on a game I'm calling <i><u>Set Apart</u></i>. It uses the <u>Sorcerer</u> game engine.<br/>
<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">
<div class="QuoteText">Instead of a sorcerer, you are creating a Holy Man/Woman (Prophet, Herald, Messiah, Zealot, Oracle/Soothsayer, Savior, Metatron, etc.) and a founder of a nascent religion. You are creating a <i>hero</i>, an exceptional individual who has to make tough, sometimes painful choices for yourself, your followers, and ultimately, the rest of the world. You are roleplaying Jesus Christ, Abraham, Mohammed, Moses, Mahatma Gandhiâ€¦or, quite possibly, Charles Manson, Jim Jones, David Koresh, Marshal Applewhite, or Osama bin Laden.</div>
</blockquote>
<br/>
You create your God (or Pantheon), your character, determine your scores, derive your Followers score, and set on about the life-long goal of establishing your religion. <b>In the modern world</b>. You deal with your Followers, skeptics, militant non-believers, the demands of your God(s), and your loved ones and friends. Because it's based on <u>Sorcerer</u>, there will be actual demons involved, as well as angels. (Depending on the Deity you serve, it may be hard to tell the difference!) You have the option to make Reliquaries, sacred objects, sacred lands, and or sacred holidays. (Yes, there are rough mechanics for making official holidays!)<br/>
<br/>
The main focus is on your character. The character is the center of the cult, and his or her actions directly determine the success or failure of the faith. (Although there are rules for whipping up a new character from the same faith if the original character eats it during play.) There are miracles, and the price your character will pay for requesting them. There are rules for characters who worship really out there deities. All of these rules are, of course, derived from the <u>Sorcerer</u> books.<br/>
<br/>
It will need playtesting, more than anything. If I push ahead to get this into print, it will need layout and art. It will also need Ron's approval, before I go any further. If not, it'll stay a little homebrew variant.                        </div>

<i><b>Beast Hunters</b></i> is currently being laid out.  Game and art are all done.  I guess that puts it in the 95% or so range.  That's the game about tribal warriors who hunt down powerful monsters and use their preys' blood to inscribe magical tattoos into their skin.  The rules are focused on letting you do that while using as much of your creativity as possible to address the challenges in your character's path.<br><br><i><b>Sagas</b></i> is my other mention-worthy project.  It's a dramatic story game that incorporates scene framing, conflict webs, story flags, etc., into the mechanics.  The conflict resolution system is focused on allowing the players to prioritize on either winning the stakes or impacting the other player's character, including changing their traits.  Then there are rewards for playing out changed traits, hitting story flags, and so on.  There are generic traits, and then you pick for each scenario or campaign which specializations you want to have available (e.g., violence, sex, intrigue, warfare, magic), which introduces specialization traits, specific rewards, different impacts from conflict resolution, etc.  It's like large-scale flagging and story-specific resolution rolled together, I guess.  I got most of the rules in various notebooks, but need to type them in so I can start testing it.  I guess that means I'm at 10-15% or so, given that a lot might change throughout playtesting.  Plus I plan to write lots and lots of example scenarios of increasing complexity for players to try out as they learn more of the rules.                        </br></br></div>

                            My game, is in the third year (that's right 3rd year!!!) and is being DELTA tested about every third day.  I won't give out the name just yet, as my original name was stolen from me! (it was fair, they used it before I published it in my name).<br>
<br>
However, we have worked out about everything that can possibly be imagined and have gone from a long conception phase, into a primary development phase, into alpha testing, into rewrite, into Alpha-2 testing, into tweaking, and then into Beta testing.  After having written what I call a "florid" version of the game, we went into Gamma testing, and there were some changes that I felt would improve the game.  As of now, I am in the stages of wrting the final draft of the final florid version of the game system.<br>
<br>
We play test new ideas for a couple of hours each week and then move on to a campaign that has been running for over 8 months straight now without any players dropping out...and we've added to new players to the mix within the past 3 months.  I am PROUD to announce that I have 9 players, plus myself, and that we're talking about some people that have kids, etc...so it's not like they have lots and lots of free time on their hands.<br/>
<br/>
Once a week, one of my wife's friends runs her campaign done in my system and I get to sit in a player's chair...AND THAT ROCKS!!!  I would like to proudly point out that she didn't like most RPG's before this and hated D&amp;D, and thought that D20 was just a marketing scheme...now she's heavily back into gaming and has gotten her husband into it as well.<br/>
<br/>
I would say, at this point, that I am 90% done.  I have a solid idea.  Good mechanics to make a FUN game that is easy to learn.  I have acheived close to all of the goals I had when I crated this system, and am in the final stages.<br/>
<br/>
Is it good?  Hostory will decide                        </br></br></br></br></div>

<b>Pinnacle Empty Quiver</b>: Game Chef 2006 entry. A terror organization has infiltrated an overseas military base in an occupied country, secured a nuke, and has taken hostages. The military base is the home base of an elite anti-terror special force, which will be used in this engagement. The hostages are their loved ones... A lot of the issues in reviews and in the thread at the monkey site have been addressed. Combat works and is way cooler now. Skills need to be finished. Weapons written up. I've added a new rule about morale. It's coming along nicely. Bits and pieces have been playtested, but not from start to finish yet. Hopefully, by Christmas. Then proof reading, finding pictures, layout, etc... That stuff will be about 60% of the work, so I might be 30% finished.                        </div>

<b>Crime &amp; Punishment</b>, my 2006 Game Chef winner is a quick and dirty way to create procedural dramas like Law &amp; Order, CSI and Without A Trace. It's been through one round of playtesting, and is in need of another. I'm working on further resources, and hope to be releasing in the spring. I'd give it 70% done, because what's left is time consuming if not crunchy.<br/><br/><b>Victorian Romance Kate</b> is the code name for my newest obsession, a minigame that presumes that RPGs were invented by dangerously cloistered Victorian girls. I'm going to kick my ass to have the second draft ready by my March 1st deadline. It's sitting at about 30% right now. (Edited to add: the deadline isn't self-imposed, I meant to say this is a submission for PUSH 2)<br/><br/><b>1000 Stories</b> is brewing on the back burner and Brand and I are considering an overhaul. It  will, eventually be a game suitable for serial pickups or one shots that tell of the ellegaic moments of people's lives. It was at about 40%, but I'd put it down to 20%, and the better for it. It's on it's way to playtest draft.<br/><br/><b>Vision</b> Is a whisp of an idea right now. Sitting at only 5% or so, it's going to be a long time in the making. I wouldn't expect it out for several years, and not necessarily by that title.<br/><br/>I've got a frigging file full of other stuff, too, but these are the ones currently getting attention.                        </div>

Oh, this sounds awesome.  I'm a big Karen Joy Fowler fan and this sounds like something from the Fowlerverse.<br/>

Actually, there's all kinds of awesome in the pipeline, I hope it comes out the end in 2007.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: markv</cite>a first draft of Manifesto! is 80% written and needs examples of play, more quotes from real manifestos, and before and after photos of a detourned board game, perhaps from a play test. In theory this could be completed and released in some form by the end of the year.<i>Still not playtested, could be at anytime, since I bought this nerdy 'teach kids to cross the street safely' board game at a thrift store for this purpose</i></blockquote>
Whoa, I want to hear more about this. Manifestos are near and dear to my heart. What's the game like, other than having a board?                        </div>

                            Yay! I've been hoping for a thread like this to pop up. I'm really interested to see what next year's crop of games will be.<br><br>I'm looking forward to <b>Gothic</b>--related external/internal conflicts sound way juicy.  Markv, I'm really interested to see how you work out the <b>Wine Dark Sea</b> scansion mechanic. A friend of mine had a character in our long-term Ars Magica campaign who had been cursed to speak only in iambic pentameter. I was always in awe of the fact that she could pull it off.  I'd love to see you let us mere mortals aspire to that level of metric attainment. I also want to see your <b>Satanic Mills</b>: Marx + Polaris, <i>brrr</i> appropriately evil goodness. <b>Set Apart</b> sounds intense and right on. Instead of exploring the f@cked-up-edness of standard romantic relationships, this would be a good model for exploring the kinds of projection and abuse of power that occur in a leader-mass of followers situation. Mm-hmm.<br><br>The game I'm working on right now is <b>Sign in Stranger</b>, my alien first contact game where your group of humans leave earth, never to return, to create a colony on an planet inhabited by sentient alien species. The players create the new world and all within it by a mad-libs inspired mechanic where you pick randomly drawn words to describe the aliens, plants, animals, structures etc. that they encounter. I'd say it's 30-40% done. World creation mechanics are done, but I'm still working on nailing the mechanics for conflict generation and resolution. My second playtest draft should be done soon.  June is my goal for it, NOT August. <br/><br/><b>City of the Moon</b> my classical Japanese game a la Genji is probably 45% done. It was an Iron Game Chef entry in 2005. Playing <b>the Roach</b> helped me feel better about the completeness of the mechanics.  I probably don't need to write my slavery game <b>Rise Up</b>, since Julia is working on her more awesomer <a href="http://luckylamb.blogspot.com/2006/10/i-write-this-with-sleeping-ingrid-on-my.html" rel="nofollow">slavery game</a>. Perhaps I will write a couple mods for her game set in ancient Rome, Indonesian sweatshops and sci-fi satellite belt mining colonies which I was kind of excited about for RU.  And <b>Under my Skin</b> the third in the Three Quick Games about the Human Heart series, which is about multi-party romance crises (a la The Big Chill or poly circles) is next on the list after Sign in Stranger. It's probably 20% done. That sucker will have mechanics that I suspect are going to be hard to write. And the social contract level is going to be killer.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Thank you, Emily. I'm also hoping for players experimenting about relationships to one another. What if two Messiahs from different religions become friends, or fall in love? What will their Followers say? What about their Gods?<br/>

                            I should probably also mention that Thomas Robertson, Shreyas Sampat, Selene Tan, and I are collaborating on a "boxed set" storytelling + roleplaying + boardgaming hybrid thingee called <i>Four Nations</i>, with no real fixed development schedule.  The idea is that four great storytellers from four different storytelling traditions come together to tell portions of the great historical epic that features heroes from all four nations.  Each storyteller represents their home tradition and tells stories based on specific ritual guidelines, so basically each player plays according to a different set of rules.  I have no idea how close we are on this.  Maybe 2%.                        </div>

<a href="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Errantry.pdf" rel="nofollow">Errantry</a>, a game of medieval quests, built on the chassis of the Solar System (as in TSOY), is awaiting playtest - a few people have expressed interest but I haven't heard anything in a while. It's authentic medieval fantasy (but also supports owlbears), distributes the "GM" role between several players at any one time and rotates it through the group, and has a quick random generation method for NPCs. It uses a system of plot tokens to pace the quest.<br/><br/>I wouldn't like to put a percentage on it, that would depend on how many issues the playtesting shows up, once it gets some.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.csidemedia.com/wiki/files/City%20of%20Masks%20Storygame.pdf" rel="nofollow">City of Masks</a>, set in the same setting as my almost-completed novel of the same name, is in much the same position: waiting for playtest. It uses dominoes for resolution and is about intrigue and conflict between young nobles in a city where everyone wears carnival masks all the time, and there are elaborate conventions about always acting in character with your mask.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Acts%20of%20Desperation_4.pdf" rel="nofollow">Acts of Desperation</a>, which specifically sets out to produce a 5-act structure to an adventure story, with "skinnable" settings, is currently stalled because I need to decide exactly where I want to take it, and because I'm pretty sure that the resolution mechanic is crap.                        </div>

                            I'm working on a Stealth Project only a handful of people know about. It's been stalled for over a year, but I've finally worked out the key mechanic, which is quite brutal. <br/><br/>The game itself is possibly the most depressing RPG ever made. I described it to a longtime friend, who asked me, "Why would anyone want to play this?" <br/><br/>The big deal is that it is, in fact, playable, targeted, and potentially fulfilling. <br/>I have a standing offer from a publisher, but I'm not sure I shouldn't save everyone the trouble and just put out a very limited edition. <br/><br/>Man, if Wallis was still doing NewStyle games, this one would fit the bill.                        </div>

<a href="http://www.dresdenfilesrpg.com/" rel="nofollow">The Dresden FIles RPG</a> is dragging ass and is way over deadline, rather than proceeding at the breakneck pace I want it to.  I'm at least 80% at fault.  That's the only percentage I'll give.<br/><br/>Most other games are either drafted but without playtesting (e.g., Chimaera, Beat the Clock, etc), or still existing solely as an idea without words on the page (Contents Under Pressure, Nothing Is Real, Heavy is the Crown, A Fire in the Blood); some of that last set only exists as a name, but I know something will grow from them... eventually.                        </div>

<b>Miss Schiffer's School for Young Ladies of Quality</b> is fully written and has had one solid playtest. It's about young adventurous lady scientists/explorers in the 1890s. It was a high finisher in the RevEnge Challenge, and I'm committed to doing right by it, so I'm not rushing anything. It'll be published, but probably not for another year.<br/><br/><b>Twist</b> is the short-story game I want to write but I don't even know if it's possible. After writing <a href="http://www.nightskygames.com/" rel="nofollow">1001 Nights</a>, I got to wondering; can I do the same for <a href="http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/ohenry.htm" rel="nofollow">O Henry</a>-style stories? I want it to work, but ironic twists may not be something that a shared-GM style game can do. <br/><br/>The Imp Of The Perverse, Sign In Stranger, Grey Ranks and Resevoir Ducks are games I'd buy right now.                        </div>
