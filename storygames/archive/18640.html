It was suggested that the Ancient Decadence might be an addictive drug grown in the swamp, which may or may not turn you into a zombie, and that the Tentacled Supremacists might be preparing to launch an attack from their hidden island fortress.<br/><br/>We open with Slyspur in his makeshift laboratory, searching for a way to cure the villagers of their addiction. Bryant is marching through the swamp in his Powered Assault Armor (1d8), laser-cannoning and uppercutting zombies as he goes. Click Clack is nearby, using her Translating Helmet to parley with the Snake Marauders. And Rocktopus is leading his ragtag militia up a broken hillside to investigate the troubling rumors of activity within the dead volcano...<br/><br/>The first round goes well for Bryant and Click Clack. I exterminate the Zombie Cult, rolling more than six hits and so gaining a d8 Reward: Fame, but also rolling enough Danger to suffer the Complication: Bryant's Power Level is Low. Someone suggests that the Snake Marauders are the servants of the Tentacled Supremacists, who hate everything except those with tentacles (or those who look like tentacles). Click Clack meets with the Snakes and attempts to convince them to defy their oppressors and join us in the coming battle against them. She also rolls 7+ hits and gains them as a d8 Reward: Ally.<br/><br/>Things go less well for the others. Slyspur attempts to synthesize a sort of gamma-methadone, using himself as a test subject. He manages a few hits against the Ancient Decadence but also takes 2d4 worth of Danger, which John suggests might represent the accidental triggering of a temporary new mutation! Johnstone has a copy of his excellent random-table compendium Metamorphica with him, and Ben uses it to roll up something like Hyper-Metabolism. Meanwhile, Rocktopus and his crew discover the crashed Alien Vessel at the center of the volcano, which they now realize is actually an impact crater. The ship's defense drones detect their approach and the two groups exchange gunfire, resulting in a few hits and a few Danger.<br/><br/>The round ends and the remaining Threats roll four hits, taking out half of the Village meter! John decides that this represents a surprise air assault by the Supremacists. He describes them using their tentacles to helicopter in and attack the drug-addled villagers. Bryant returns from the swamp and joins in the fray just as his armor's batteries sputter and fail.<br/> <br/>Back at the volcano, Rocktopus realizes that his men are outgunned and that he must use up some of his Ancient Electrogrenades to turn the tide. Holding one in each hand, he uses his ability of Adaptation to cause his arms to stretch, then uses his Psychic Senses to carefully deliver the grenades to the perfect spot. Adding the leftover bonus dice from last round's hits, his odds look pretty good. Alas, everyone insists that the advanced age of the grenades, his limited stretchiness, and the fact that his men are all drug addicts make the situation at least 3d6 more dangerous. Sure enough, he rolls something like 10 hits but also plenty of Danger and is taken out. But wait! John suddenly implements a new house rule stating that he's only been captured, and places a new Threat with a 2-point countdown on the table: Rescue Rocktopus!<br/><br/>Johnstone describes how it all went down: he and his men fought their way into the ship and finally managed to defeat the robot drones, but the climactic Electrogrenade explosion accidentally reactivated the entire Alien Vessel. He suggests that the blast doors have just sealed themselves and that the ship is now preparing to return to its homeworld. John approves.<br/><br/>Over in the Village, the battle with the Supremacists continues to rage and Slyspur races to finish his last experiment before his precious lab is destroyed. John reminds him to add the 2d4 for his new hyperactivity, and describes his hands shaking as he mixes the final ingredients. He also warns everyone against piling on too much Danger this time. The advice works, the Ancient Decadence is defeated, and Slyspur gains a d8 Reward: Technology. John suggests that he had to jury-rig some innovative upgrades to his lab in order to finish the cure and that perhaps he can now make all kinds of crazy alchemical stuff.<br/><br/>While the Supremacist soldiers are busy, Click Clack storms their island base, ordering the Snake Marauders to carry her across the water in an ostentatious display of power. Someone suggests that she should cover herself in snakes and pretend that they're tentacles. Instead, she uses her mutant power to Grow Five Times Her Size and orders the snakes to dangle from her mandibles. She approaches the island "like a tentacled god come to take back what's hers," paralyzing her enemies with fear and awe.<br/><br/>Someone suggests the danger that they might already have a tentacled god and might summon it to fight her. I add the further danger that she might defeat it and then get stuck being their new god. Shuo rolls enough hits to take out the Supremacists, but also enough Danger to get taken out herself. John rules that Click Clack has indeed been captured, that her coming was prophesied and that the Supremacists and the Snake Marauders have now imprisoned her in a cavern on the island. Their soldiers return to base and devote the rest of their lives to worshipping their "Great Damp One." Shuo takes comfort in the fact that she'll at least be well fed.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth_Magdich" title="Seth_Magdich"><img alt="Seth_Magdich" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth_Magdich">Seth_Magdich</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418773/#Comment_418773" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-21T22:43:41+00:00" title="July 21, 2013 10:43PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Back at the Village, Bryant's armor is running on empty, so I take a moment to address this Complication before attempting any heroics. I like the idea of somehow draining power from the as-yet-undefined Robot Parasites, and I begin looking for a logical way to introduce them into the scene as soon as possible. First, I suggest that their caves might be connected to the volcano. This is approved, and someone else suggests that the Alien Vessel might have crash-landed in that spot because it had detected useful ores and minerals there that it could extract and use to repair itself. Clearly, the Parasites must be mining drones which been slowly digging for years. Someone else then suggests that some villagers had recently vanished while exploring the caves, which is why Rocktopus was sent to investigate. The Alien Vessel must have reprogrammed those mining drones to dispose of trespassers.<br/><br/>I now suggest that the Robot Parasites choose this moment to explode out of the ground beneath Bryant's armored feet. John is horrified but agrees to it. I suggest that the Alien Vessel has identified the Village as the source of the intruding mutants and has ordered its drones to destroy or distract us while it prepares for blastoff. Someone suggests that they look like the killer robots from Screamers.<br/><br/>I describe several of them latching onto Bryant's armor, then falling lifelessly to the ground as he reverses their polarity to recharge his atomic cells. Someone adds a d6 for the robots' electronic countermeasures. Bryant releases a computer virus to subvert their alien operating system, using Man Out Of Time (1d8) and quoting a line from Independence Day. Someone adds another die, suggesting that he might lose control of the virus and end up infecting his own suit. I roll and defeat the Complication but also get 2d4 worth of Danger. The armor is back to full power but has been compromised in some way that John prefers to leave undefined for the moment.<br/><br/>It's the end of the round and the Robot Parasites get a hit against the Village. John describes them as swarms of nanites who attack everyone wearing metal. They chew through their targets on a subatomic level, reducing them to a powder, which then blows away!<br/><br/>Round 3, I'm all excited to try to save Rocktopus and there's no real initiative system so I just jump right in. I describe crazy alien glyphs scrolling across Bryant's heads-up display as well as the video feeds he's receiving from the Alien Vessel, showing Rocktopus trapped inside and banging on an airlock door. Bryant signals the ship's AI, trying to Charm his way into its good graces (I believe it had a Weakness to Charm) and persuade it to let Rocktopus go.<br/><br/>(John, in a sultry computerized voice: "Why, hello... I admire your genetics... What big genetics you have...")<br/><br/>I bring in my Stamina bonus die, since I've been fighting zombies and robots and power outages all day. Someone gives me a d6 for the "substantial danger" that Bryant is "too sexy." Someone else offers another, suggesting that the AI might take over my suit with a virus of its own, that it too may have seen Independence Day.<br/><br/>I roll the dice and yell "Welcome to Earth!" and get 6 hits and 5 Danger! Everyone cheers. And then John points to the 2d4 I still haven't rolled. Everyone groans. I roll another Danger and I'm Taken Out.<br/><br/>John describes the scene: Rocktopus is banging on the airlock door when it suddenly opens to reveal Bryant's powered armor standing outside. It seizes Rocktopus, tosses him outside and steps into the ship. At the last moment, he hears muffled cries for help from behind the helmet's tinted visor, then the door whisks shut.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in the Grand Hall of the Tentacled Supremacists, chained to the wall, Click Clack sits and reflects on the path that brought her here. Ben declares that Slyspur is leading a guerilla assault on the island to rescue her. He describes sneaking around and taking out patrols with his Poisoned Spur. Someone suggests that his hyperactivity makes this more dangerous, and John adds the ferocity of the Supremacists who will stop at nothing in defense of their god. But Ben rolls and succeeds and Rescues Click Clack, taking just a few d4s to represent injuries from the fighting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth_Magdich" title="Seth_Magdich"><img alt="Seth_Magdich" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth_Magdich">Seth_Magdich</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418774/#Comment_418774" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-21T22:45:21+00:00" title="July 21, 2013 10:45PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rocktopus stands outside the airlock door, wanting to get far away from this ship of death, but also feeling obligated to return the favor and Rescue Bryant. Ben talks everyone into taking a recovery instead. The AI prepares for launch and begins a countdown. I suggest that it's showing Bryant some video footage of his friends taking their recovery actions. She says things like, "you see, your friends have already moved on, they are not interested in rescuing you, they do not love you like I do." And Bryant's morale is dropping, "I guess the mutants never really liked me after all, I never really fit in..." The AI comforts him and asks if he wants to watch Sleepless in Seattle.<br/><br/>End of round, the Robot Parasites miss the Village. John explains that the villagers have climbed up into the trees to temporary safety.<br/><br/>I suggest that the AI needs a name and, using the Everyone Everywhere List, roll up "Alicia". John writes it down as "Alie-sha". He mentions that she also has the complete collection of Police Academy movies, if I'm interested. I suggest that her home planet must have received and analyzed lots of 80's movies, and perhaps the ship was originally sent here to destroy our awful planet.<br/><br/>Rocktopus uses his Adaptability to flatten himself and sneak in through the Alien Vessel's exhaust vents while adapting his lungs to breathe rocket fuel. John suggests that "Alie-sha 7" is an explorer ship and very adept at coping with infestations from other planets, generally by flushing them into the plasma chamber. Ben adds a die for the danger involved in swimming through a spaceship's fuel tanks while it's preparing for takeoff. I add another danger, that Alie-sha may send Bryant in his powered armor to kill Rocktopus.<br/><br/>Johnstone rolls and succeeds, rescuing Bryant but taking a few d4s in the process. He says that this represents the stress of being drenched in rocket fuel and then set on fire by Bryant's lasers, all while mutating uncontrollably from the ship's antiviral countermeasures.<br/><br/>I suggest that we now see the Alien Vessel blasting off from the top of the volcano, rising into the air, and then it explodes. Johnstone suggests that we then see an escape pod launch at the last second, and I accept this. He suggests that the pod crashes in the middle of the Village square, and that Bryant dramatically kicks the door open with a boom. I totally accept this, adding that he then carries the unconscious Rocktopus to safety in slow motion, just as the pod explodes in the background for no apparent reason.<br/><br/>Bryant activates all of his weapon systems at maximum power, unleashing destruction upon the remaining Robot Parasites. I bring in his Black Ray Pistol before remembering that those only work on organic targets. Johnstone jumps in and justifies it, saying that it's been repurposed as a targeting system for his shoulder-mounted micro-missile racks. I also bring in the Fame bonus die, describing how the villagers are inspired to rally behind the Great Zombie Slayer who also apparently just saved Rocktopus and destroyed that Alien Vessel as well. Johnstone grumbles about how Bryant always gets the credit.<br/><br/>I add a couple of d6s, saying that by saturation bombing the Village like this, he may well destroy it in order to save it. Rocktopus uses his Psychic Senses to help him to target the Parasites while Click Clack uses her Translating Helmet to mimic their command language and order them all to charge into my line of fire. John suggests that she sounds like the carrier tones from an old modem. Ben adds one last danger, that Alie-sha may have left some hidden subroutines in the armor's system.<br/><br/>I roll 7+ hits, the Parasites are annihilated and Bryant gains a d8 Reward: Romance. John suggests that the AI did indeed transfer itself into Bryant's armor at the last moment and has now genuinely fallen for him. She reads his memories, downloads herself into the remaining nanites and reassembles them into a perfect simulacrum of his long-lost wife! Yay, love conquers all!<br/><br/>(Somehow, this came across as sweet and romantic at the table, though it seems pretty creepy writing about it now.)<br/><br/>And that was the last Threat, which means we win! The smoke clears from the bombed out ruins and John describes the people slowly climbing down from the trees, horrified by the devastation but praising their great and powerful heroes for saving them.<br/><br/>We end the story with the Village now in control of the entire area, rebuilding and expanding with the aid of its powerful new allies, worshippers and technology. Johnstone suggests that this might have been the day that they started calling it the Empire.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418893/#Comment_418893" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-23T11:58:02+00:00" title="July 23, 2013 11:58AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh man you cannot imagine the grin this put on my face.
