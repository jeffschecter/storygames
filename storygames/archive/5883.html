You can skip the next four paragraphs if you'd rather not see the details.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst I took Gumshoe's (Esoterrorist's) investigative abilities and clue finding, and divorced it from the rules for general abilities and dice rolling. Instead, I linked in the One Roll Engine (ORE) dice mechanic instead (where the default roll is usually 4 dice, plus one per point spent from an ability). Except that the opposed contests rules of ORE never sat well with me (I don't like gobbling dice). Instead I jury-rigged a version of Dogs in the Vineyard's dice poker conflict resolution into that place, modifying the way fallout and escalation works to fit it back into the ORE system and Gumshoe abilites, and in the process made Preparedness the social/money resource equivalent to the mental resource of Stability and the physical resource of Health. This gives an investigation-focused game with interesting room for conflicts and a solid mechanic with no dependence on hidden information.<br/>\n<br/>\nI then decided that I liked Passions from Reign (an ORE variant), which give benefits when pushing towards your passion, and penalties when working against it. But I wanted them to do more, so I combined them with keys from The Shadow of Yesterday, to give a good reward mechanic and to make it interesting to take penalties by seeking to transform/buy-off your motivations. Then I turned to another one of my hacking goals: subtle, but pervasive magic. For that I cribbed from Nephilim, specifically the way astrological modifiers change unpredictably, and affect nearly every non-mundane task that they do. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe result was influence dice, which represent the occult influences of magic, the stars, time and space - fixed dice that encourage certain sets in the ORE dice pools, and so make certain outcomes more likely from actions and conflicts, by associating each number 1 - 10 a set of meanings and associations. The influence dice in a scene are determined themselves by the dominating sets of a roll using contributing fixed dice (the current astrology, day, and location), plus some random ones. Thus certain influences are more likely in certain places and times, but nothing is certain. I also pulled occult abilities as a bridge between investigative and general abilities porting skills in Nephilim and giving 1 trick (spell, summon, formula, etc.) for every 2 points as means to modify or add new influences. To keep magic mysterious at first, you cannot start with occult abilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe last hurdle was a way to rapidly construct mysteries. For this I borrowed the Dogs in the Vineyard's town creation rules as inspiration, spreading them out as the layers of a conspiracy / mystery. The first step is to take a list of investigative abilities and occult associations and lay them out among the layers of the mystery. These will become clues. Each clue connects 2 or more situations, people, and places - drawn as lines between them, giving fodder for scenes. Then each mystery has a semi-random series of resources to use to cause trouble for investigators, based on the Dogs NPC creation rules. By interconnecting these grids, it becomes possible to run multiple simultaneous mysteries and conspiracies, building a real Veronica Mars feel to the game. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you done any four or five game combo hacks? Do you want to?

Perhaps you could offer some thoughts on how your design goals take you there.<br/><br/>As far as the mystery grid system, it has an odd history - it started with a desire to have a Dogs like scenario creation system in my Star Trek inspired RPG, <a href="http://wyrmwood.srgames.org/playtest/drift_1_4.html" rel="nofollow">Drift</a>. The basic idea in that game was that characters are largely based on drawing from a set of Truths and Insights which they possess. So, I struck upon a way to create missions that made them thematically coherent for the world in question (which has a set of truths) and allowed the rapid creation of NPCs and situations, before and during play. Here is an example of such a mission map:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://wyrmwood.srgames.org/playtest/Mission_Map.jpg"/><br/><br/>The idea here is that you first decide on a concept for the mission, then place down the rounded boxes, indicating the truths and insights  you want to mission to possess. Then as you draw lines connecting them use those two fixed points to produce a character or situation sharing combining those concepts and giving you a stable of elements to bring into the mission. Drift takes this much further, using the mission map as a means to resolve the mission, not merely a GM tool. But the basic idea seemed useful. <br/><br/>I decided to combine it with a bit of the Dogs sense of a hierarchy of sin. Which produced the following result (still being worked on, pardon my dust). <br/><br/>First, concept one or more mysteries or conspiracies. Then, take some big paper (or attach several sheets together) and write out each mystery / conspiracy as a short phrase in a circle. Space these out so that there is ample room between them, but put those that you want to be related closer together than ones which are completely disjoint. Then start drawing a contour map with each mystery as a peak. Leave at least an inch and a half of room between the curves. The idea here is to indicate the level of secrecy by the "height" or "depth" of the conspiracy. A height of 2 or 3, indicates a crime not well hidden or a minor conspiracy, 6 is a more significant conspiracy, and 10 is probably as far as you should go, indicating a mystery that will take many sessions to solve. <br/><br/>You can do some clever things here, putting mysteries within conspiracies, or having two conspiracies splinter off from the same rising secrecy. You can leave some edges open, so you can expand and add new mysteries later. But the simplest version is just to have a 5-6 tiered bullseye around a single mystery. Once you have the contours it's time to start adding the clues. <br/><br/>First assemble a list of investigative abilities which you associate with that conspiracy. You should also list any interesting themes, techniques, and such aspects which you associate with the mystery. Lastly, list which PCs you feel should be directly connected to the mystery. Then start writing out large circles with these in them, until you have a decent number on the map (2-3 times the number of tiers, maybe more). Only put the PCs at the base level, outside the layers of secrecy. When you place an investigative ability or an aspect of the conspiracy leave room in the circle to specify what the actual clue will be. <br/><br/>Then it's time to start building the situations, characters, and locations. These will connect two circles, and the only constraint is that they can be discovered through either of the circles associated with it. As you draw and flesh out the lines, define what clue the circle represents. Bear in mind, as you grow and add lines, you may need to revise some of them. <br/><br/>Some advice about defining the connections: An interpersonal ability tends to be associated with people, while other investigative abilities will be linked together with locations and situations. As you move towards the center of the mystery, you'll join up with the conspiracy circle, these will be the masterminds, criminals, final reveals. Remember, you can re-use things by changing the context - the lawyer who gave you some trouble early on might turn out to be the mastermind's lieutenant. As the GM, you can even keep this somewhat vague, picking which is the lieutenant based on how things are going up to that point. Lastly, clues are the gateways, so make sure that learning a clue would reveal everything around it.<br/><br/>For the base level clues (including the associated PCs), those clues are available from the beginning, to at least one PC. This is the common knowledge and hooks to draw in the players. On the other hand, any connection which crosses one or more levels of secrecy is special. These people, locations, and situations can cause some serious trouble to the investigators. At present I've got a system of random NPC template creation which makes a pool of obstacles and antagonists that defend a specific mystery. The size of that pool is based one the number of levels of secrecy the conspiracy has. I was going for something similar to the feel of Dogs NPC creation. <br/><br/>While this is significantly more work than the mission map above, it should produce an adaptable, extensible network of related and nested crimes and conspiracies. Of course, I haven't had the chance to test it yet.<br/><br/>   - Mendel S.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tomg" title="tomg"><img alt="tomg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://tomgurg.googlepages.com/tinyrobot1.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tomg">tomg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132403/#Comment_132403" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-04T13:50:50+00:00" title="March  4, 2008  1:50PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a really interesting concept and I'm trying to draw the picture in my head.

But I'm also having trouble following the text a bit. For instance, how do you make sure that certain things reveal other things? <br/><br/>And, for instance, do those contour lines equate to some kind difficulty/adversity in the system? <br/><br/>My mashup idea starts with Fudge-like traits and a small set of Pools. You can spend dice from Pools do you give yourself a greater chance of success in conflicts. However, instead of the "spend - refresh" dynamic in TSoY, they move up and down more like the Pool. (It could work with either the Pool or the Anti-Pool inversion.)<br/><br/>Here's what it looks like. You have four Pools, which are:<br/><br/>Sensitive -&gt; Daring -&gt; Disciplined -&gt; Brutal<br/><br/>(Imagine this as a circle, with Brutal linking back to Sensitive.)<br/><br/>When you attempt an action, you decide which approach you are taking, and can spend dice from that Pool. If you succeed, you do not lose the dice you spent, and can increase that Pool by one. If you fail, you lose all the gambled dice and increase the next Pool in the circle by one. <br/><br/>For instance, if you fail a Daring roll, you lose whatever Daring dice you rolled and add one to Disciplined.<br/><br/>It works with the Anti-Pool method, too--just reverse "succeed" and "fail" in the text above.<br/><br/>One interesting side effect is that, if you want to increase a Pool (say, Disciplined), you should try to engage in conflicts of Daring and hope you fail (i.e. go up against stiff odds or opposition).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
