First things first, in the rules there are two ways to play the game: one focuses more on the characters, looking at what they want and trying to get it (so, I <i>always</i> try to win a personal scene, because I <i>alway</i> focus them on something the character badly wants).<br/>\nThe other is more casual/tactical; I'm referring, for example, at looking at the Grid choosing whether to lose or to win a mission and/or personal scene based on it ("If I lose personal and win mission I get a d12 from the Grid!"), or at choosing who single out based on who brought the chips.<br/>\nHere I'll speak about the first way, since I think the second undermines the game, so I never played it; in the first way, I make the character choosing things I - as a person - care about. So, the Thing my character Hold Dear is something that, with that particular character, I can also care about, at least a little.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said: I'll write about a lot of things, hoping to address what you want; if you had any doubt after reading my post, please feel free to ask. I'll be glad to try to answer.<br/>\n<br/>\nFacilitating the game is, at least for me, quite simple: its rules are very simple, and usual I explain them on the fly, so don't worry about this; you can explain them when you need it (for example saying only in second Chapter that people can begin a personal scene in <i>any</i> moment).<br/>\nI think it's more important to understand what is behind them; in my opinion: <i>Grey Ranks</i> it's about being a teen in an "adult situation", dealing with what you <i>have</i> to do and what you <i>want</i> to do.<br/>\nMission scenes are about what you have to do: will you do it? It's worth it? There is no a wrong mission, as long as it's something the characters have to do and it's something somewhat bigger that them. Obviously, "I have to do this" doesn't mean "I will do this".<br/>\nIn the game I'm playing, our first Chapter mission was simply to mark Igo (the betrayer in first Radio Lighting broadcast) with some paint in a station; it was bigger than us because there were nazis; there were danger; there were weapons; and we... we are kids.<br/>\nOn the other hand, personal scenes are about something the character cares about: it could be related to the war, or completerly unrelated, but the "care about" part is very, <i>very</i> important.<br/>\nA couple of examples: Thing Hold Dear, My friends. Symbol: a non-Grey Ranks German teen, blamed to be a traitor. In the mission we took a list of possible traitors and his name was on it. So... personal scene: flashback. A bunch of guy bullying him; I tried to defend him and I failed. Back to the present: I deleted his name from the list: I wasn't able to defend him then, I'm trying now. This actually goes <i>against</i> the mission.<br/>\nSecond example: in the mission two PCs met a child, who running lost a shoe. One PC took it and for some reason really cared about it, but she lost it. Personal scene of her brother (the other PC): he went to take it again. Goal: not to be seen by nazis. It was - as the player himself said - a weak scene; why? In my opinion, because "The nazis don't see me" is a <i>mission</i> goal; in a personal scene, the goal should have been something like, "I find the shoe", because <i>that</i> was what the character cared about. The <i>personal</i> issue at the stake.<br/>\nObviously, "have to" and "want" can coincide, and maybe nobody ordered the PCs to do the mission: Chapter nine, I framed the mission: the nazis attack our camp. No order: we had to fight to survive; we wanted to fight to survive (and if someone didn't want... great stuff for a personal scene).<br/>\nAnother example: a Grey Rank is lost in action, the squad decide to go and rescue him. No order, they have to do it only because they <i>feel</i> they have. Nevertheless, they <i>have</i> to do it (and if... as above).<br/>\nMission and personal scenes then can easily overlap to some extent (framing: the artillery hit the hospital tent where you first love is).<br/>\n<br/>\nThen: in the first two/three Chapters, the game could seem somewhat "lame", but if it happens don't worry: in my experience, it's quite normal. You start with a buch of kids and little more, so the first Chapters are useful to build some common ground and (if needed) to kwnow the other players; but then it becomes very, very better.<br/>\nBut, a very important thing, don't run in the first Chapter: it could be <i>very</i> defining. My idea about Thing Hold Dear for my character in the game I'm now playing was My family, but in first Chapter, when the four of us was running from nazis, I said something like, "I look at the three of you, to be sure you're safe". I said that without thinking, but then... it was quite obvious the Thing my character Hold Dear is My friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn general, one thing I'll never stress enough is that <i>everyone</i> can (and should) add elements: I narrated two PCs heard a cry from an alley, another player said, "It's a girl"; and then we found she was a child, the one who lost the shoe, so she become important for a <i>third</i> character (and incidentally also for the fourth, who was the PC's brother).<br/>\nSomething endangers you, something helps you, a simple color element ("The clouds cover the Sun")\u2026 the game needs this; if someone gets in "audience mode" it's possible you'll miss something (maybe with some "\u2026 and now?" moment).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now, what I call "Grey Ranks 2.0": it's simply some tweaks I developed with Luca Veluttini, a friend of mine, but we think they are really useful and make a better game.<br/>\n<br/>\n\u2022 The "corner scenes": when you hit a corner, make a short narration with your character showing the corner. Hanna was a Jewess, but hid this and use her pseudonym - Alicja - as a name. She hit Nervous Breakdown, and the player narrated Hanna in front of a mirror, asking to herself if she was Hanna or Alicja.<br/>\n\u2022 The "opposite notes": when in a personal scene you win, you win; but with a negative note. When in a personal scene you lose, you lose; but with a positive note. I made a personal scene in which my character was trying to derail a deportation train to set free some friend of his. I managed to do it, so I said the train's driver saw me and accelerated; I managed to derail the train, but due to the velocity it rolled and some people inside was hurt. I freed my friends (success), but hurting people (negative note).<br/>\n\u2022 Personal scene: by the rules, you state a question - Will Janek kiss Halinka? - and frame the scene you'll play. What if I have a scene I want to play, I know it's important, but no question? We can do better; each scene, we choose among three options:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Question first, but not quite: as in the rules, but you can change the question mid-scene. Example: the bullying scene I wrote about before; I didn't explicitly state the question, but it was quite obvious from the beginning.<br/>\n- Question in the middle: you begin a scene and, when you find something worth, you state it and roll. No example, sorry; at now I can't think about a scene resolved this way.<br/>\n- <i>Fiasco</i>-style: the roll doesn't resolve a question, but the whole scene (as in <i>Fiasco</i>, if you'are familiar with it). Example: in the last whole game I played, my Thing Held Dear was My friend and the symbol was another PC; I knew it'd be worth a scene with him before the Uprising, but I had no idea about a question. So, I simply framed it: a couple of years before, in the training camp. He was training in shooting, without bullets, I was helping the instructors. We rolled, I failed, and... I corrected him, and he took my perceived hardness as an incentive, building the ground - he really respected me - for all the trouble this would bring next in the scenes we already played.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, look at <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXD51CY8DkA" rel="nofollow">this</a>; I found very useful to have an idea of what Warsaw was like during and after the war.<br/>\nAnd, I think <i>The Wall</i>, by John Hersey, is great for ideas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327236/#Comment_327236" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-01T06:03:15+00:00" title="June  1, 2011  6:03AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is great, thanks so much!<br><br>After watching that video, I also found...<br><br>WARSAW RISING The forgotten soldiers of WWII:<br>- <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FraPAIvIOT0" rel="nofollow">Part 1</a><br>- <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJ0Vo0XMMzQ" rel="nofollow">Part 2</a><br>- <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BISs_0tHIoA" rel="nofollow">Part 3</a><br>- <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Wk7zRQLnCU" rel="nofollow">Part 4</a><br>- <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd6LExmjBe8" rel="nofollow">Part 5</a> </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mauro" title="Mauro"><img alt="Mauro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mauro">Mauro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327348/#Comment_327348" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-01T12:57:56+00:00" title="June  1, 2011 12:57PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 1, 2011 12:58PM by Mauro.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, I'm glad it's helpful.<br/>\nBy the way, I forgot a thing, in "Grey Ranks 2.0": by the rules, in Chapter ten the surviving PCs get an epilogue; we made one also for the dead ones, focusing on what was left.

To speed things up, we are going to skip a few chapters (probably play chapters 5, 7, 9, 10). <br><br>This was my first time reading the rules and facilitating the game. I noticed that when I played twice before, the person facilitating left out what I consider a crucial element to the game! <br><br>In Mission Scenes, the die you contribute affects what happens in your immediate mission scene AND in the overall mission in ways that contrast. If I contribute a d10 to the overall mission, our mission is likely to succeed BUT we suffer some sort of disaster in my immediate mission scene. The better the die for the overall mission later, the worse it is for us now and vice versa. If I contribute a d4 to the overall mission\u2026 things may be bad for us later but we immediately gain some sort of success in the short term. I really, really like this. It's very dramatic and movie like. <br><br>But the two times I played, this rules was ignored (I believe unintentionally). The rule is a bit counterintuitive at first but is clearly indicated on our character sheets which helped remind us to play correctly. But I just noticed, the original character sheets we used in my first 2 games didn't have the reference to that rule on them!                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327530/#Comment_327530" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-02T10:34:41+00:00" title="June  2, 2011 10:34AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh man, that rule is so important.

Ralph, do you narrate in a character putting forth more or less effort when you hand over the bigger or smaller die?  I'd be down to try that...

I'm more likely to interrupt a dull scene than a great one.  But I think an explicit social agreement could get me to try another way: "We don't mind losing our momentum, we're confident we'll get it back, please challenge us with dramatic interruptions, to let the tension from one scene stew through another!"  <i>That's</i> unnatural to me, but also cool, intriguing, and totally worth a shot.  It seems like many folks get mileage out of similar techniques -- Jeff C calling for 5-minute breaks during intense action in PtA, Ron cutting between protagonists just before resolution rolls in Sorcerer and tSoY, and someone (Judd?

In that game you don't play the characters long enough for them to develop actual relationships and twisty motivations with each other.  But you have played together as a group long enough to have developed meta motivations.  Mapping the meta back onto the fiction creates a nice synergy where you can get the feel of really deep characters who have completely valid reasons to stab each other in the back, even though you've only been playing those particular characters for a brief time.<br><br>Grey Ranks is less back stabby than BRS, but for me it works the same way.  The fact that I know that you tanked the mission three times in a row by your players choice of die is definitely going to inform how I have my character interact with your character in the fiction whether or not you actually played out dropping the ball during the mission in the fiction or not...although if you did, so much the better.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327993">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327993/#Comment_327993" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-06T10:44:06+00:00" title="June  6, 2011 10:44AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Weird.
