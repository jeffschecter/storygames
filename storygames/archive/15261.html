It could've been more Shakespearean, if I'd done more research, but I was super-busy at the time with other stuff, and the deadline was the Monday after Comic-Con, and I didn't really start on it until halfway through the time allotted. That's enough excuses, right? Yeah, that about covers it.<br/><br/>As for the contest itself: I thought it was a great theme with great ingredients -- no complaints from me on that front. I really liked the peer review and rating process, and how that determined the finalists while leaving the actual selection of the winner up to Jonathan and his father.

There were still surprising and inspiring games, of course, but I feel like that had more to do with the theme than the interaction of the theme and ingredients. I would strongly suggest that efforts be made in the future to have the theme and ingredients chosen independently, so as to promote stranger (and stronger) interactions between the two.<br/><br/>That said, the theme -- and the fact that an actual Shakespearean scholar would potentially be reading the entries -- was the main reason I produced a game. Consequently I was a little disappointed that my game never made it that far, since I felt like it had some things to say about our modern experience of Shakespeare, and said them in an interesting way; while I liked the critique format overall, it was a little frustrating reading reviewers who didn't appreciate that aspect of the game. But to be fair my game has a giant content-related red herring on top of it, and I can't really complain that people assumed that was all I had to say about the theme. Such is the nature of peer review, and I'm sure there were things in the games I reviewed that I didn't fully appreciate either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_346706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346706/#Comment_346706" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-23T09:56:33+00:00" title="October 23, 2011  9:56AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thought the theme was far too specific.

I was a finalist last year too, but I didn't like the way I got there. "Convince as many people as possible to play your game!" Even if it was a shitty game, as long as more people played mine than anyone else's, I'd win. It didn't matter what the playtesters thought, or what kind of experience they were bringing to the table, or what I did with their feedback. It felt like it was more about marketing than design.

They improved my score for the finals, but that didn't actually help me any as a game designer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>I preferred peer review methods to the one person judging, as it meant that I got more feedback from a variety of viewpoints.  As far as aspects of GC go, getting feedback and interaction is more valuable to me than the initial spur to create games.   I create weird little RPGs all the time, but what I need are other people looking over them to give their opinions on stuff.<br/><br/><br/>I read over a lot (but not all) the games from this year's GC, and felt like they were a lot more similar than in previous years.

My entry last year was GMless, too. But I don't normally play GMless games, and I don't think I'd be very good at the two GMless games I've written. (Three, I guess, if you count <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mpvFB_sGHs6PYh7RJDwnimM2WnkXiHYJ-3dMC_svAUI/edit?hl=en_US" rel="nofollow">Nerdball</a>.) It might have something to do with whoever's in the "facilitator" role having a different set of responsibilities -- and sometimes mechanics -- than the rest of the players. I dunno. I've tried to write more about the subject here, but I'm having trouble articulating just what the Hell I'm talking about, so "I dunno" will have to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_346771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346771/#Comment_346771" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-24T09:51:42+00:00" title="October 24, 2011  9:51AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 24, 2011 9:51AM by PaulB.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I think many participants immediately glommed onto "the topic" being literal in-the-period Shakespearean plays, rather than a broader understanding of what makes a certain piece of fiction "Shakespearean". I was immediately turned off by the former and intrigued by the latter, since I'd never really taken the time to pull apart the structure, common themes, narrative tricks and general vibe of Shakespeare's work. But man...everything -- EVERYTHING -- I read in my little cluster was literal, actual in-the-time-of-Shakespeare "Shakespeare games". Same with the couple extra reviews/critiques I worked on afterward. I was bored by all of them for this alone, although at least one design I think would have been a much better game if the creator had gotten away from the literalness.<br/><br/>As a participant I also feel like this general literal take on the contest meant it was really hard for a submission like mine to get a fair shake. I submitted a game that I thought really hit some signature Shakespeare elements -- midstory revelations, dramatic irony, audience participation, bloody endings -- but the single most consistent reaction I got was "uh this is sci-fi, I don't get why this is in a Shakespeare game contest." <br/><br/>The structure of the feedback circles worked fine. No complaints but some observations: I think it's been difficult for "serious" participants to get matched up with one another -- or, perhaps, for like-minded participants to find others with a compatible agenda. I have no idea if this is solveable, since obviously it means making some value judgements on participants and their motives. But having done three of these now, it's now my expectation that I'm going to get matched up with generally non-serious, incompatible participants. Additionally, I'm honestly not sure what the best way is to seek out other like-minded participants other than trolling the Forge meta-game forum, which I didn't even *know about* until after the contest was over. <br/><br/>On that note I think that's my only true structural criticism: It sure seems to me, as an outsider, that active participation in an off-site, non-official forum was expected and encouraged but only via the folks who were already part of the circle that'd be participating in that forum in the first place. No recommendations other than to clarify well in advance, something along the lines of "if you want to solicit feedback on your WIP leading up to your official submission, we strongly encourage you go to (FORUM ADDRESS)." <br/><br/>Agreed with Jason about the obvious ingredients. In fact I think it was the very obviousness of the ingredients that, IMO, led to the literal "game set in the time of Shakespeare" issue. I'd very much like to see ingredients that are perpendicular to the theme in the future.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_346784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346784/#Comment_346784" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-24T11:04:25+00:00" title="October 24, 2011 11:04AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 24, 2011 11:04AM by James_Mullen.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">[cite]Posted By: Paul B[/cite]I submitted a game that I thought really hit some signature Shakespeare elements -- midstory revelations, dramatic irony, audience participation, bloody endings -- but the single most consistent reaction I got was "uh this is sci-fi, I don't get why this is in a Shakespeare game contest."</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nI kind of had the same feeling about my entry, <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.groundhoggoth.co.uk/images/stories/games/faded_glamour1.pdf" rel="nofollow">Faded Glamour</a>: the Shakespeare theme was baked into the mechanics of the game (characters have different dramatic stances as the game progresses and their stance can change as a result of the scene; the current stance limits the actions the character can take) and the Fairy Folk were only a secondary layer; really, the game itself could be about anything, because the mechanics still shape the story into a Shakespearean drama.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_346799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346799/#Comment_346799" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-24T11:38:12+00:00" title="October 24, 2011 11:38AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 24, 2011 11:39AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Somebody<sup>1 </sup>should do a genre/setting analysis of the games in the competition.

If you're completely hands off, people find it hard to engage with each other or get excited enough to finish.  If you go in and try to set up a bunch of structures, it distracts from the task at hand (i.e. designing the game) and puts people together who aren't interested in what each other is doing, ending up feeling more alienating than relationship-building.  So finding the right middle ground is tough.<br/><br/>The way I'm approaching things, I'm trying to keep the attention -- as much as possible -- on finishing a game and whatever participants need to do that.  Connecting with other designers and getting great feedback would be nice, but -- in the end -- it's not absolutely critical and it's not something I think I can be responsible for.  Sometimes it happens, othertimes not so much.  And I'm not sure there's a formula that will make it happen most of the time for most people.<br/><br/>And, honestly, being an indie designer is kinda like that. Sometimes you connect with folks, othertimes not.  Sometimes you make a game that people get and are excited about, and othertimes people don't really understand it or it can't find the right audience.  The people who end up being successful are those who push a project through and gradually build interest as more and more people play it and get excited about it, even if that takes a while.  That's partially why the games that win Game Chef have never really gone on to be successful, while games that made a less of a splash in the contest end up being bigger deals.<br/><br/>The thing about Game Chef that's hard to remember sometimes is that it's not really about the experience of the contest so much.  It's about what that experience does for you -- to help you build confidence and experience as a designer -- and the games that come out of it (in the event that you get lucky and develop something that people actually want to play repeatedly).  And you can get the benefits of that even if it's not always a perfect experience.  There is value, in fact, to be had in persevering through a mixed experience because -- lord knows -- indie design and publishing is nothing if not full of mixed experiences.  If some people don't get your game, that can drive you to improve and clarify it; whereas folks who's game gets major praise may be less clear on where to go next.<br/><br/>Now, I don't mean that as a cop-out.  I'll certainly keep trying my hardest to make the experience the best that I can.  There's no point in upholding suffering as a virtue or something and, really, an incredible amount of good stuff and positive interactions came out of Game Chef this year, as it does every year.  But what I'm trying to say is that some of this stuff isn't really my responsibility or even in my power to make better, given the amount of time and energy I already devote to this.  I don't want to have to closely moderate a forum or coerce people into writing useful reviews (how would I even know what that would look like?).  At some point, I have to just trust and hope that people will make a decent good-faith effort and assume that others will be tolerant when people are inevitably late, flakey, slapdash, conservative, judgmental, or otherwise less helpful and supportive of their fellows than they might be.<br/><br/>Designing Game Chef is a kind of game design in an of itself and, in game design, it's almost always better when you trust the players and don't try to micromanage or railroad too much.  And, although I have some pretty radical notions about contest design (see: Murderland), I'm also limited by the traditions and expectations that I've inherited from previous master chefs. Believe me, if I had to create a design contest from scratch, it might not look much like this.<br/><br/>In any event, that's where my head is about some of this stuff. 1) Yes, we will continue to get better, but 2) recognize that Game Chef -- as an institution -- can only do so much to create an experience that will be productive for you; and, 3) it's really about what happens afterward: the contest is just an excuse.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_346863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346863/#Comment_346863" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-25T00:34:27+00:00" title="October 25, 2011 12:34AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for sharing that, man.

It might even be true that the feedback culture around design contests is healthier than for games that <i>aren't</i> part of contests. I think it would be cool if there was a contest format that would help people get better at this development stuff, but I don't think Game Chef has to be the place where that gets figured out (although one thing I liked about the 2009 contest that got dropped partway through and hasn't been continued in later years was the 1 week, 2 week, 1 month, etc. thing where people were required to do meaningful development on their game in order to claim the achievement).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_346927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346927/#Comment_346927" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-25T19:22:42+00:00" title="October 25, 2011  7:22PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was excited that this Game Chef didn't include any playtesting, play-storming, or vote-by-playing.<br/>I feel like initial design flurry &amp; playtesting are two separate and distinct phases of design, and they have totally different needs.<br/>To attention to fuse them together is to do a disservice to both. IMO<br/><br/>I was disappointed that the theme &amp; ingredients fit together neatly.<br/>I really wish that the ingredients were as disparate as possible, and that the theme intersected with them only in non-obvious ways.<br/><br/>Lots of cool games came out of the competition.<br/>Many of the games existed within a tiny range - Shakespearean dramas set in Shakespearean times.<br/>It was interesting to see how the cluster of Shakespeare games felt similar to and different from gaming's existing "dense clusters of games on the same topic," like Lovecraftian investigative horror, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/otherdoc" title="otherdoc"><img alt="otherdoc" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://otherdoc.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/jimsquared32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/otherdoc">otherdoc</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347055/#Comment_347055" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-27T08:41:53+00:00" title="October 27, 2011  8:41AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 27, 2011 8:45AM by otherdoc.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This was the first year I actually finished the game on time and therefore the first time I got to participate and I have to say it was awesome.<br/><br/>I discovered that I enjoy making games. I'm not great at designing mechanics, but I expect that's something you get better at in time. I think the word limit helped - I probably wouldn't have finished it on time otherwise. At the same time, I think my game suffered in the contest from a lack of clarity because I wasn't able to take the time to explain the reasoning behind some of the bits I threw in there and precisely what they do. Of course one could argue that if the game is truly solid you shouldn't HAVE to explain much about what you're doing, but either way it means I need to work on how I express the different parts of the game. And that was also pretty cool, actually - doing this showed me what I need to do to improve as a game designer.<br/><br/>I liked most of the entries I read - the one that still really stands out in my mind is <a href="http://sailorkitsune.wordpress.com/2011/07/25/tempest-in-a-tea-cup/" rel="nofollow">Tempest in a Tea Cup</a>. But then, I've always been a fan of The Tempest.<br/><br/>For my own <a href="http://everyworldnews.com/stuff/Genesis_Undone.pdf" rel="nofollow">submission</a>, as far as the theme was concerned, I didn't take it literally, which might have thrown folks off. I was thinking about Gene Wolfe's "Eschatology and Genesis" (a play-within-a-sci-fi-novel) and stumbled into the thought, "What if Shakespeare had written the story of Genesis?" And immediately the first answer that came to me was that he'd expand the cast. So I did that, making it about a "first race" of people after they've been exiled from paradise. One of my goals was to make it feel like playing through a Shakespearean tragedy, so I used the act structure, conflict through dialogue and a number of the character archetypes one finds in Shakespeare's plays in a way that I hoped would push the players toward PvP and end with a stage littered with bodies. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I was kind of thinking of In a Wicked Age as well when I working on it. In general, there are a number of things I could probably take out of the game (including the GM according to reviews I've been getting!) and other bits I need to tweak, but honestly, I'm just happy I actually finished writing a game.<br/><br/>Response to it wasn't necessarily glowing with praise, but for a first outing I think I did pretty well. Overall I think I got a better response on the Lady Blackbird <a href="http://everyworldnews.com/stuff/RvR.pdf" rel="nofollow">hack</a> I wrote for Graham Walmsley's alternative Game Chef. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> (Even though I didn't finish it until well after the deadline - but I had a blast making it).<br/><br/>All in all I think the best thing about my experience with Game Chef is that I discovered how much I like designing games and that I'm looking forward to doing more of it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
