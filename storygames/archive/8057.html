Players play stalkers - people entering twisted Zones in the hope of finding artifacts to sell, and also negotiating the social jungle surrounding the areas (corruption, official investigators, etc.) Think a scientific variant of D&amp;D, basically, with lots of social aspects included and with a strong emphasis on really playing your character as a persona. What sets it apart from others is that it's damn well written, and has a very smooth yet surprisingly reliable diceless mechanic where the GM grades idea qualities and situational role-playing, and then counts their multiple against a target number. This makes it very smooth to play, as long as people accept a very old-school idea of absolute GM authority.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs the game is in Finnish, so are its home pages.

I'll be reviewing it one of these days, when I have an opportune moment. It'll be interesting to see how the international scene likes the game - heck, if Ville gets it done and printed before Gencon and my own plans don't go astray, I can take a bunch with me there to promote and sell - it'd be great to get to sell Stalker at Gencon. Let's look into that around June or so, it'll be no problem to carry a couple of suitcases worth (my suitcases will otherwise be empty anyway on the way there, so as to have space for stuff on the way back), if you want to send some to a fulfillment service over the Atlantic or something. (Unless it's easier to just print there.)<br/><br/>Theory-wise it has considerable similarities to <i>Dread</i> (the Jenga one), and it really is surprisingly coherent when you get right down to it - lays it out very clearly how the game should be played. I'd characterize the advocated playstyle as vanilla simulationism, and the mechanics certainly don't get in the way of that. The most important techniques the game uses are GM prep and constructive dialogue (really, the method used to resolve conflicts is all about this), everything else flows from the basic split of player/GM roles. The thing I especially like about the conflict resolution system is that it's non-random and completely based on the narrated reality all players have at hand; gives some real zing to player decisions, and practically forces players to think in terms of the fiction instead of mechanics. Lots of GMing advice worthy of Epediah Ravachol, too.<br/><br/>One thing I'm going to write about in a bit more detail when I get around to reviewing the game is that Stalker is written by an adult, and it's very gratifying how non-nerdy it is even while the game advocates all-out adventure content. It's like the polar opposite of the American violence fantasy overload <a href="http://isabout.wordpress.com/2008/03/23/cultural-subtext-of-modern-fantasy-gaming/" rel="nofollow">I suffered last summer</a>. I remember how reading Stalker then helped me to put all the plastic ultraviolence to perspective - the game is so down-to-earth and serious that this modern "OMG! Ninjaz!" thing is completely anathema to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177789/#Comment_177789" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-08T13:07:34+00:00" title="November  8, 2008  1:07PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's very interesting.<br/><br/>Ville: When this comes out in English, I'm very much looking forward to giving it a play!
