                    We are looking for two to three dedicated Guides to help us develop and run our LARP campaign over the next two years.  It will be an old west game set in a world not too unlike ours (the names have been changed to protect the guilty).  We require that you commit to attending the six conventions/gatherings (three per year) that the LARPs will be run and a monthly meeting (online accommodations are also acceptable).  We will be developing table-top games intermittently at other events to add depth to the campaign.  Although development will included the table-top games, running them is voluntary.<br/> <br/>At what events the games will be run will be a group decision but we are hoping that we can start at PhilCon 2006 in November (to be discussed at our first meeting).<br/> <br/>The LARP will use a new set of simple rules based off of the Burning Wheel system.  All characters will be made in Burning Wheel (a set of books will be provided).<br/> <br/>The group dynamics will be very democratic among the Guides.  We have begun a storyline and some character backgrounds but we're open to new ideas.  I feel my job stands as a moderator, both among Guides as well as between Guides and the game we create.  I retain veto rights to certain sweeping ideas that I may feel detrimental to the big picture or contrary to what we've all developed.  The Guides may unanimously out-vote my veto. <br/> <br/>Most correspondence will be via an email list.<br/> <br/>Please let me know if your interested in joining us in this rewarding role-paying endeavor.<br/> <br/>Yours in gaming,<br/>- Don<br/>Philly Game Whore                </div>

                            So I am curious, especially you long time LARPers, what turned you off to this endevour.  Maybe it's something I should cut back on?<br/><br/>Thanks for your input,<br/>- Don                        </div>

                            Don,<br/><br/>Actually, it sounds really interesting. I can't commit to all those conventions, since I'd imagine they're in the States, but I like the idea.<br/><br/>I'd be really interested in seeing the ruleset. Have you really made a LARP interpretation of Burning Wheel? <br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Okay, so your off the hook Graham <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>We'll be running the LARP at various conventions based on whose interested in helping us.  If some west coast folk say "I'd like to help and are willing to split the burden we'd be more than happy to run a third of the games there, a third here and a third midway (like Origins and GenCon).  In fact PhilCon or DexCon here, KublaCon or GenCon SoCal there and either of the big cons each year would be just grand (sorry, I don't think I can commit to a European tour just yet).<br/><br/>Yes, I have developed a set of BW LARP rules.  They are akin to Nobilis/Mortal Coil with an action pool based on your stats and skills changing the costs of bids.  I plan on having a set of cards with "manuevers" on them to utilize scripting in a limited degree.  We're still in the development phases.  I think I will work on a more finished version this week and send out a playtest notice.                        </div>
