I've thought about a Pokemon roleplaying game but it would need a huge, huge book of critters.<br/><br/>Same with Warhammer - I like building armies and putting together all these weird units and I'm pretty sure this is something that is just not in the realm of roleplaying games and I'm just wishing that roleplaying games could give me that sort of enjoyment so I don't have to buy and paint miniatures.<br/><br/>So I guess what do you enjoy about Pokemon?

But, in that case, combat seems more central to the whole enterprise.  Messing around with your Company isn't necessarily fun in and of itself, not in the same way that that raising Pokebeasts and massaging army lists in WH40K is.  Hmm...<br/><br/>Maybe it could work as a Bliss Stage hack?  I'm serious, work with me here.  So like, in Bliss Stage, your character (trainer) is measured in their relationships to other characters (pokemon).  And these relationships are measured in several traits that are exhuasted during missions (pokefights), so you refresh your traits with downtime scenes in between the missions.  Sure, you'd have to hack the trait system pretty thoroughly, but that's a step in the right direction, I think.  You'd have to make the downtime pokefarming scenes actually do really fun and interesting things, so I'm not sure exactly how you'd want to structure them.<br/><br/>In my head, I'm also like: so D&amp;D has this ginormous list of beasties already.  Surely you could figure out some way to just use the Monster Manual as your corebook.  Or the D&amp;D minatures rules that they just canceled.  Those seemed to involve placing beasties on the map and having them fight.  You'd just need to add some system for raising your uber-cute mindflayers or something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195066/#Comment_195066" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-02T12:06:39+00:00" title="March  2, 2009 12:06PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Take <a href="http://www222.pair.com/sjohn/pokethulhu.htm" rel="nofollow">Pokethulhu</a> and ignore all the Lovecraft references.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doyce" title="Doyce"><img alt="Doyce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.average-bear.com/img/dice-c.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doyce">Doyce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195067/#Comment_195067" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-02T12:11:42+00:00" title="March  2, 2009 12:11PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cute-Fuzzy-Cockfighting-Seizure-Monsters/dp/1894525167" rel="nofollow">Cute &amp; Fuzzy Cockfighting Seizure Monsters</a> (for BESM, a pretty hackable system).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195068/#Comment_195068" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-02T12:11:52+00:00" title="March  2, 2009 12:11PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 2, 2009 12:12PM by ccreitz.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oddly enough, I designed a whole, White-Wolf-mechanics based Pok\xe9mon RPG many moons ago.  It is slightly playtested and seemed fun.  I will try to dig that up, if I still have it and you're interested.  Please whisper your email address at me if you are.<br/><br/>There is also Pok\xe9thulhu, which does a surprisingly good job of capturing the rock-paper-scissors ecology of the setting.  You might just try straightening that out a bit.<br/><br/>Finally, the actual algorithms that underlie combat in the video games are well-understood, as Googling will reveal.  If you're feeling quite ambitious, you could simulate the physics of Pok\xe9mon battles at the precise same level as those games, and then extend that out to non-combat tasks.  So whatever chance you give a random Pok\xe9mon to succeed in finding his way through a field of tall grass?  An Insect-type monster has a bonus that doubles that chance (or whatever).<br/><br/>EDIT: When I started writing this, Mr Teapot hadn't posted yet.

Nothing there that you wouldn't get out of any generic system of your choice. Unfortunately your options for playing a pokemon game are sadly limited, but I suppose that pokethulu or something based off a heavily hacked D&amp;D (or perhaps a hacked red box hack?) could work. Good luck, whatever option you go with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195213/#Comment_195213" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-02T23:23:07+00:00" title="March  2, 2009 11:23PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I've been talking to Jonathan a little bit about this and idea-mining Pokethulhu.

There is certainly a copy on my ancient, undead desktop and if I get a chance, I'll boot that sucker up.  But it might not happen.  Honestly, in that my game focused on the trainers as PCs, it maybe wouldn't have been as interesting to you as it was to my group.<br/><br/>To kind of make up for that, I did unearth the Pok\xe9mon Junior Adventure Game, and I'll do a quick writeup wth the actual game in front of me.  This is an ultra-rules-lite game targeted at players 6-8 years old, plus one adult narrator who probably doesn't have GM experience.  Fact that will surely warm the cockles of Story Gamer hearts: although the players play trainers, there are <i>no mechanics whatsoever</i> for trainers.  Even more: there are <i>no non-combat mechanics for Pok\xe9mon</i>!  Everything is freeform, with the narrator even encouraged to do some fishing!  Pretty sophisticated stuff for a major-label game, with this target audience, from 1999...  my first thought was to suppose that Jonathan Tweet might have been involved.  He just gets a thank-you in the credits, which list <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Slavicsek" rel="nofollow">Bill Slavicsek</a> and <a href="http://www.stannex.com/" rel="nofollow">Stan!</a> as the designers.<br/><br/>The game is structured around Episodes, each of which is built around a conflict that can be resolved by cockfighting, naturally.  An example Episode (this is the text that the narrator reads):\n<blockquote>You and your Pok\xe9mon are relaxing and having fun at the Pallet Town Pok\xe9mon Center [inn, in computer RPG terms].<br/><br/>What are you doing?<br/><br/>What are your Pok\xe9mon doing?<br/><br/>Suddenly you hear a scary noise outside.  "SPEEEEEAROW!" [...there is a flock of wild Spearow...]<br/><br/>"You, there!  Pok\xe9mon trainers!" Police Officer Jenny calls to you.  "The town needs your help!  Will you send your Pok\xe9mon into battle?" [... the adventure assumes that you do, of course.  There is some fluff...]<br/><br/>[Not to be read out loud] To drive off the Spearow flock, the Trainers must hurt it for a total of 15 Hits [...] The trainers can't capture any of the Spearows [...] The Spearow flock attacks once each round.  If its attack is successful [on 4-6, detailed elsewhere in the text], <b>all</b> Pok\xe9mon fighting it receive 3 Hit Tokens.<br/></blockquote>\nEach Pok\xe9mon card has two sides, with one attack described on each side.  Players choose one or the other attack before each round of combat, and then reveal their choice.  For example: Bulbasaur is a 9HP Pok\xe9mon with two attacks.  First is Growl, which on a 3-6 connects for one Hit, and then you flip a coin, attacking again on heads; second is Vine Whip, which does 3 Hits on 4-6.  Other monsters have "attacks" that heal them for a few HP.<br/><br/>There are a few really unsatisfying things about the Junior Adventure Game.  The mechanics for Pok\xe9mon combat are extremely simplified, and do not take into account the rock-paper-scissors dynamic of the RPG, although that could easily be bolted on by having bonus/penalty hits if the types line up in the appropriate way.  Also, there no conditions (e.g. poisoned), which are definitely a major factor in the video game. Finally, although the game has some evolutionary lines in it, such as Bulbasaur to Ivysaur, there are no rules for evolution; I guess that is handled in story, which is OK but there probably ought to be some mention of that in the book.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195363/#Comment_195363" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-03T20:50:55+00:00" title="March  3, 2009  8:50PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I should add that although the conflicts can all be resolved by cockfighting, some of them are not cockfighting per se.
