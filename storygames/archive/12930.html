Shade is this androgyne who always wears masks and her art is theater.  We have a hold, a whorehouse in the middle of the ruins of a big city.  Shade gets by doing plays for the staff and customers, its her one light in the world.<br/><br/>We'd decided Missed was the one person Shade spoke with about the history of theater.  So there we are, in what passes for the playhouse in the hold, talking.  (MC) Remi cuts in with Missed trying to kiss Shade and she stiffens.  He professes his love for her.  That's when I find a way to express the hook for Shade.  Shade spurns his advances, assuring him that he doesn't love her, he doesn't know her.  He loves the art, he loves the characters she plays.  Nothing else really matters, it's all going to die and rot away.<br/><br/>Missed gets upset, he starts walking around the stage, throwing things around.  Shade screams at him to calm down, then she manipulates him to back off.  So he asks her to give him a chance someday, that he's good at doing things, he would be good for her.  Shade agreed, but since I rolled a 10+, I knew I didn't have to do it.  We moved on to present time, but I saw this tiny crack in Shade's facade.  Did she care about Missed?  Why did she only share her art with him if she didn't?  Would she give him a chance?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_291364">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291364/#Comment_291364" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-03T09:00:45+00:00" title="September  3, 2010  9:00AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played <a href="http://www.spellboundkingdoms.com/faq.html" rel="nofollow">Spellbound Kingdoms</a> last night. <br/><br/>It's kind of a weird hybrid fantasy RPG, that mixes a lot of traditional elements (classes, levels, a fantasy setting specific to the game, six playable races, etc) with some new-school stuff (aspect-like "histories" instead of skills; "fears" and "loves" you can tap for bonus dice), plus some genuinely innovative things I've never seen before (like the combat system - which is a little mini-game where you move a counter around a sheet to unlock different fight moves as the scene progresses).<br/><br/>One of the best parts was the magic system. A spell-using character has access to multiple (and colorful) disciplines. Each discipline has "high spells" - which work pretty much like any other "list o' spells" systems - and also "close spells", which are just a paragraph covering the kinds of things that discipline can do, like mending broken pots or sensing things nearby, from which you invent spells on the fly.<br/><br/>Oh, also, whenever you use magic, you have to roll to see if bad shit happens. Your target number to beat is the number of other magic-using characters in the immediate vicinity (including yourself and your familiar).  This is a fun thing, and makes magic kind of unpredictable and dangerous, and also makes wizards dislike each other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_291512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291512/#Comment_291512" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-04T00:12:01+00:00" title="September  4, 2010 12:12AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My Supernatural Romance - the renaissance painter Lorenzo falls in love with a ghost, but she wordlessly denies him, even though she has been seduced by his art, because their love would be impossible.

It was terrific, as expected.  We did character creation (Saavyhead, Battlebabe, Chopper, Driver) and decided that they were a gang of salvage specialists in a flooded NYC where people lived on monstrous trash barges and the tops of buildings.  There was some cool backstory about the gang being formerly run by this asshole named Scorpion who had been murdered by the Chopper.  They got a job from this douchebag Millions who had a yacht and was really pretentious, to find a way into a water-sealed basement beneath a completely underwater house in the Hamptons.  The operation was very cool, involving the Saavyhead doing a lot of talking to the Psychic Maelstrom and jury-rigging inflatable rafts as airlocks.  At one point the Battlebabe cut a hand off a floating body to get through the handprint lock (she also seduced Million's goon bodyguard into switching sides).  A strange high-tech black drone was knocking about the Chopper's minions with a crazy vibration weapon, but the chopper ended up headbutting it until it exploded after he was pulled into a death grip with it when he started ripping its guts out.  And the Driver got an advance and took "My Other Car is a Tank" to make his submarine into a well-armed battle machine.

He's telling them stories about the time before The Event, where people have so much food they throw some out and how there are green parks and oceans of water and rain that doesn't burn. At first, Shade sits back watching and judging his delivery (Shade's "art" is theater), but she is soon drawn into the narrative and the hope welling in the room. Beckett turns to Shade and asks her if she has a question. She reaches into her luxe gear and produces a beaten, coverless copy of a playbook and hands it to him, asking, "Is this really from before... or is it a lie, too?"<br/><br/>The MC asks me what play it is and I tell him it's a copy of <i>As You Like It</i>. Beckett smiles and tells Shade that yes, this is from before The Event, many many years before. He tells her it is a lovely play filled with romance and humor. Beckett looks into Shade's eyes deep and says, "What do you <b>really</b> want to ask me, child?"<br/><br/>The MC asks me to make a Weird roll, which I utterly fail. Shade asks, "Back then, was there really love or was it all on the stage; was it all a lie then?" Beckett squints at Shade and answers plainly, "Yes Shade, there was love. There IS love." and it bored into her soul and she had no defense to deny its truth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_293716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293716/#Comment_293716" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-17T02:49:02+00:00" title="September 17, 2010  2:49AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Our DFRPG game was a hoot tonight.

The Engineer hits up some of her contacts to score floor-plans of the prison building; he'll pass them on, but wants to meet her for dinner. As the dinner wears on, the contact gets drunker and drunker, and less and less classy with his advances. Eventually, she tells him a random hotel and random room number and tells him to meet her there- she'll be waiting.<br/><br/>The next morning, the party settle on hiring a hotshot lawyer instead- never mind that the copilot is bang to rights on the charges. The Engineer's reaction?<br/><br/>"I didn't go on that dinner date for you not to break him out of prison!"<br/><br/>As it happens, they break him out anyway by taking advantage of the conspiracy's efforts to spring one of their own. The Wing Commander blows away a key conspiracy member with an elephant gun, but not before he sets a fire that ends up roasting most of the inmates alive.<br/><br/>The copilot is safe, but there is still the question of the Wing Commander's pending court martial...<br/><br/>(Much later they read a news story about a respected architect getting arrested for knocking on a hotel room door with his trousers around his ankles.

We have one player who prefers Right to Dream, one Step on Up player and me and another are mostly Story Now. The big thing is that now it's out in the open and can be addressed directly, we can try and deal with it. We now know why we two SN players kept kicking shit in the fan in the RtD guy's games (because we wanted conflict and plot, while he was content with "being there", with no drive), why it's very hard for us to run games for the SoU player (he is a problem solver by nature, so he easily "breaks" games that are not about optimal/tactical solutions) etc. The only "surprise" was the SoU player expressing his desperation in trying to run games for me because feels it's impossible to impress me, to which we resolved that he should stop trying so hard to impress, since that's not what I'm looking for. <br/><br/>I now have empirical (if subjective) proof that actual play, as such, is about fulfilling the individual players' creative agendas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293976/#Comment_293976" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-19T20:17:39+00:00" title="September 19, 2010  8:17PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 19, 2010 8:18PM by Harlequin.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Annalise.<br/><br/>Our character, a cast member at a local cabaret, is fighting for many things in the moment.

She's also trying to avoid losing the favor of the troupe's song-writer.<br/><br/>Things go from bad to worse as she falls into a caughing fit and nearly passes out behind the curtain, tearing lose one of the support structures that collapse into her stomach and knocks her winded.<br/><br/>(Mechanically, too many "1"s were rolled, prompting two additional consequences)<br/><br/>She screams out in pain so spastically that she goes hoarse and can't perform for days, is humiliated by Bambi (who then sleeps with the troupe's song-writer to curry favor,) fails to so much as get the phone number of the guy she was targetting, but at least the male lead in the cabaret comes to her side.<br/><br/>The worst part?  Everyone thinks she's faking it, except Bambi.  As Bambi's leaving with the aforementioned writer, she is the only one who looks back with any sympathy; no one else believes it for a minute.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294127/#Comment_294127" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-20T21:41:50+00:00" title="September 20, 2010  9:41PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lady Blackbird.

He's telling them stories about the time before The Event, where people have so much food they throw some out and how there are green parks and oceans of water and rain that doesn't burn. At first, Shade sits back watching and judging his delivery (Shade's "art" is theater), but she is soon drawn into the narrative and the hope welling in the room.

She reaches into her luxe gear and produces a beaten, coverless copy of a playbook and hands it to him, asking, "Is this really from before... or is it a lie, too?"<br/><br/>The MC asks me what play it is and I tell him it's a copy of<i>As You Like It</i>. Beckett smiles and tells Shade that yes, this is from before The Event, many many years before. He tells her it is a lovely play filled with romance and humor. Beckett looks into Shade's eyes deep and says, "What do you<b>really</b>want to ask me, child?"<br/><br/>The MC asks me to make a Weird roll, which I utterly fail. Shade asks, "Back then, was there really love or was it all on the stage; was it all a lie then?" Beckett squints at Shade and answers plainly, "Yes Shade, there was love.

I'm playing the pilot Snargle. \\ While we're flying to Nightport, only to find out there is an Imperial blockade between us and finding passage through the Remnants. While in Haven, Kale Arkam had bought four baby sky squid on some fool notion that he could sell them in Nightport.<br/><br/>Captain Vance comes up with a blockade-breaking plan that involves some heavy hurting on the Imperials. Arkam chains up the baby sky squid out the back of the ship and I pilot The Owl out into the Blue, trolling the babies behind us like bait.<br/><br/>I dive deeper into the corrosive mist until we hit upon a sky squid family, then we turn tail and make a mad run straight up out of the blue and at the head of the blockade, the Hand of Justice. Vance smooth talks the scout ships over the com (something akin to "Please gods above help us, there are sky squid chasing us! Don't shoot us down!!!") while Arkam purs on the steam (literally) and I do a bit of fancy flying, dipping straight into their hangar while Bishop, tethered on the hull, cuts a baby free, then I zip out of the ship and snake around it, leaving it in the path fo the squid family.<br/><br/>We settle down in Nightport's outskirts with the fires of the Hand of Justice lighting areas of Nightport that'd been dark for ages.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_295424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295424/#Comment_295424" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-30T16:58:47+00:00" title="September 30, 2010  4:58PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fiasco.
