Usually, I have a game design I'm working on, or a recent thread and I want to post about it. Here, it just sorta popped in my  brain. I wanted to post about it, and just see some fun ideas. MAYBE later, hear some system suggestions. <br/><br/>I think one seed was planted when I got to thinking about how specialized many creator-owned games are, and how I'd love to see more situation development as a community. <br/><br/>The other seed is the SG forum's recent dust-ups make my eyes hurt.<br/><br/>Anyway ... <br/><br/><br/><b>Creating a Scenario</b><br/><br/>So, I'm imagining a scenario of play, one we build in this thread. The situation is right out of the history books. You can modify it like mad, unless you're Jason Morningstar. And, well, he's just crazy.<br/><br/>Anyway, the situation is lifeted right out of Entebbe. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Entebbe" rel="nofollow">Check out this if you don't know what that was.</a>  It's totally ok if you don't know.)<br/><br/>1) Terrorists have taken an airliner, its crew, and passengers hostage.<br/>2) They landed the plane in a country ruled by a sympathetic dictator.<br/>3) The terrorists and hostages are there for several days, which comprise the scenario.<br/><br/>That's it for the start of this thread.<br/><br/><b>Your Turn</b><br/><br/>Ok! Now, I want this thread to take that idea, and make it evolve. How can we make that a workable scenario? Bring on the ideas.<br/><br/>Here's my first idea: \n<blockquote><b>Idea:</b> On day 2, a woman hostage goes into labor.</blockquote>\nThis is trickier than it sounds. My aim here is NOT a rail-roaded scenario. Maybe it's over by day 2? I dunno. I doubt it, but you get the idea. Players affect the scenario. Their characters do stuff. The scenario must change as a result. We probably can say what will happen <i>if things don't change</i>. So ... <br/><br/>ALSO! I'd love to hear some ideas about who the players portray. Hostages? Cool, if it works. Special Forces? Of course! That one seems obvious. Diplomats? News reporters? Cool, and cool. Terrorists? Um, I dunno. More ideas? FROM YOU.\n<blockquote>Day 7: The terrorists kill all male passengers.</blockquote>\nThis will work as a scenario idea here. But, it very easily might be avoided or circumvented in actual play.<br/><br/><b>SOME THREAD RULES: (WHAT NOT TO POST)</b><br/><br/>1) This is meant to be a "story game" scenario. Read that as Narrativism. If the Forge gets your panties in a twist, call it whatever you want. The scenario is about some crazy, tense stuff. You can action it like crazy, but women with babies are in the way, m'kay?<br/><br/>2) Stuff your politics right up your ass. I don't care if you think the PLO is the worst thing ever, or if Israelis glorify violence, or if I'm stereotyping Africa, or whatever! You'll note that none of those things are in the above except "terrorists" and "dictator." Deal. Even you, Morningstar.<br/><br/>2a) This is not a political discussion either. It's a practical game play idea. Take the McLaughlin Group someplace else.<br/><br/>NEXT ISSUE!<br/><br/>3) Forget supernatural hogwash entirely. Action? Sure. Be fucking Chuck Norris for all I care (no thanks, personally). Magic and "psychic powers"? NO. Superpowers? Maybe, but you have to pay me $20 for each post. Anyone who mentions any Cthulhu Mythos horseshit gets cock-punched spit spot. I will sick Senkowski on you.<br/><br/>4) It is not a "spaceport." They are not "misunderstood aliens." Go away.<br/><br/>5) You can make it Entebbe 1976. You can also make it set in, oh, Peru 1980 or Burma 2006 or whatever the hell works for you. I encourage the thread to make the situation as geographically and temporally "portable" as possible.<br/><br/>6) Please keep the "OMIGOD! This is perfect for Game/System X!" to a dull roar for the moment. We'll get to that.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131278/#Comment_131278" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-28T12:38:44+00:00" title="February 28, 2008 12:38PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2008 12:39PM by Matt Snyder.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I should have made this a bit clearer. <br/><br/>One of the things I'm most eager to see are ideas that keep hammering the situation right between the eyes, like this: \n<blockquote><b>Idea:</b> One of the hostages is carrying nuclear secrets.

Um, I dunno</blockquote>\nDude, weak.  Maybe it's a whole different game, but the premise that you believe something enough to conceive of taking hostages, and then are testing that belief against the reality of taking hostages (who would all be just fine if they would sit quietly and do what they're told and everyone will get out okay, but no! there's gotta be drug mules and asthmatics and air marshals to risk everyone's life) and the increasing inescapable horror of the things that will be on your head...<br/><br/>Seems to me that the hostage-takers (I do like Jason's formulation there) have a schedule of some kind.  And it should be increasingly distressing, and possibly only known in full to their leader.  So, after landing, they do searches of everyone, confiscating passports, wallets and cell phones.  A few hours later, they start segregation.  That night, they ask for doctors and pilots to identify themselves.  Later they move through the cabin, waking 3-4 people up and moving them to the first class lounge, where no one else can see.  The next morning, two of the hostage takers demand that the air marshal identify himself, going as far as picking sympathetic (young, pretty) hostages and threatening them until someone stands up.  He gets taken out of the main cabin, and everyone hears the shot.  You know, that kind of thing.<br/><br/>Circumstances outside the plane getting progressively worse also strikes me as a gimme.  Ramping up to a tragically botched raid of the passenger cabin that destroys any trust built up between hostage-takers and hostages.  Of course, it also introduces at least a belt knife or sidearm into the hostage population, when one of the commandos is killed.  Or the dad of a student on the flight, coincidentally in the country, who sneaks onto the airfield and up to the plane.  Either he's tapped by the negotiators as a point of contact, or gathered up as a new hostage.<br/><br/>And yeah, the possibilities for pressure from the passengers is huge and varied.  Drug mules, criminals, important businessmen who's enterprise hangs on them getting to a meeting, spies, actual air marshals.  Medical issues of every stripe (and I'm not sure if inventive maladies are less cliched or not...): pregnancy, diabetes, asthma; schizophrenia,  depression, aphasia; dialysis, emphysema.   A hero or two.  <br/><br/>Alternatively: the jet belongs to a big corporation, (which makes the hijack trickier, but bear with) - as a result it's much more reasonable that everyone aboard belongs to either the Company or the Movement R-map, instead of passengers who mostly don't know each other.  Or, at least, there's a big group traveling together - either a sales group en route to a convention, or a church group on a retreat, or a bunch of divers on a vacation together.  And they all have their own low-simmer relationships that turn into pivotal "You, with big mouth!  Choose: him or her!" moments.  And that's the PCs, with the government and the hostage takers and the freakshow other passengers as the Sea of Bang to draw on.<br/><br/>Oh, and language trouble.

There are one or more public figures on the plane who would like to use this to steer public opinion of how they comport themselves through the crisis.<br/><br/>One hostage is uniquely priviledged with the knowledge of how the crisis will be dealt with, as they wrote the protocols for this very situation. They are reluctant to share this, as their role is deeply classified, and as the zero-tolerance, no-negotiation stance put in place is likely to condemn some of the hostages to death.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_132044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132044/#Comment_132044" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-03T08:45:42+00:00" title="March  3, 2008  8:45AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Ballyhoo Roby</cite>Just as a point of data, yeah, this game is a thousand times more interesting if you're playing the terrorists.</blockquote>\nWait...what about the negotiators?
