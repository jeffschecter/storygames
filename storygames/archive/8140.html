I've been thinking about buying some old Dragon Warriors books, since I used to play them when I was 14-15. At amazon.com they were insanely expensive, but at amazon.co.uk I found some of them for 1 penny each. (Which means that postage is almost 30 times the price of the books - oh well).<br/><br/>I played them with my 7-year-old son, just for fun and to see what they were actually like after all these years. I have to say that I hardly remember anything from back then.<br/><br/>A few things surprised me:<br/>- The very Arthurian feel. The scenario in the first book is based on the myth of Arthur, with the names changed. There's a Christian clergyman who helps the players get to the dungeon. Old oak trees, king sleeping underground. I didn't remember this at all - I thought it was a standard D&amp;D/Conan fantasy world, but apparently not.<br/>- The blatant marketing: In book 1, you roll your characters randomly. If your Strength etc are good, you can pick one of the two fighty characters - but if not, you're obviously supposed to pick one of the two magic-using characters. They're listed in book 1 - and described in book 2 <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>- The slightly boring basic combat rules. In the first encounter (with some wolves), the wolves have 0 chance of hurting Knight characters because of their armor, and only 1 in 4 chance (IIRC) of hurting a Barbarian character even if they hit. A lot of dice-rolling with no real effect.<br/><br/>I liked it, though - it's easy to play, and my son seemed to like it, too. He only went in with two characters, which was obviously not quite enough to fight 5 spectral warriors (total party kill). Also, he's used to either choose-your-own-adventure books or pretty freeform role-playing; this book is somewhere in between, and he wasn't always sure what actions were allowed.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F" title="Alex F"><img alt="Alex F" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/746/n1IV3AA06DPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F">Alex F</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179095/#Comment_179095" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-18T07:09:01+00:00" title="November 18, 2008  7:09AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dragon Warriors got nme into gaming. I bought book 2 (spellcasters) thinking it was fundementally a fighting fantasy variant, albeit one in which you could somehow do anything. <br/><br/>It took me a while to grok what the beast actually was, especially lacking the core text. It was powerful medicine when I did; I still remember that thrill, at 8? 9? of an open ended, totally empowering, dream machine.<br/><br/>Never played it! Lots of lonely fun, but by the time I got the other books different games took the attention. I remember thinking knights overpowered but dull, and magic-users fun but weak... But I felt that about rbox d&amp;d too. The mystic class was cool, I think. Matthijs, do you have the spellcaster book?

I'm waiting to pick up my copy this week (I hope).<br/><br/>I ran a game of it a year or so ago, for some people who'd never seen it before, and it worked fine, though we had a Mystic run out of magic too early, which is a pain for them. I tried to concentrate on the weird monsters which went down very well. Honestly though I never got a great Arthurian vibe, it was always more crusades for me, weary knights, distant lands where everything was miserable and hot and dry (or cold and icy) and of course the Pazzuzu, who I like to work into fantasy RPGs of every thought to this day.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pete" title="Pete"><img alt="Pete" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pete">Pete</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179108/#Comment_179108" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-18T07:48:51+00:00" title="November 18, 2008  7:48AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dragon Warriors was my first RPG too: this was mid 80s South Africa where the only roleplaying store was in a dodgy neighbourhood of Joburg where nobody's Dad would take them, so we ended up running with a greasy tattered copy of the first book that a mate had got from his nan in the UK for about a year.

Unemployed and living in the shadow of Hadrian's Wall in Thatcher's Britain, our DW games were riddled with social injustice and tension just like the country was. DW spoke to me in a way D&amp;D never did !<br/><br/>D&amp;D seemed flavourless by comparison. Points of light - DW was much more about this than Basic D&amp;D. Go beyond in the wild and there is weirdness and danger. Desperate men on some suicidal quest, stumbling wearily into a disease-ridden hamlet where wickedness abounds and the locals want to hang and quarter them. DW Elves are so hardcore fae, none of this 'well they differ by having a better dex, pointy ears and shoot arrows' bollocks - they are so Other, so distanced from humans. The setting was great - anywhere that did have any sense of social order was on the edge of crisis and impending war. Religion played it's part - not just having clerics being healing batteries - but being a force for good and disharmony, wielded as a weapon to subdue the populace or as the last hope of the wounded knight, alone against the creatures of night and shadow.<br/><br/>Apt that they re-release it as the country slides into another recession, warring in a far-off land.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179680/#Comment_179680" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-21T11:29:36+00:00" title="November 21, 2008 11:29AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mine has arrived at my FLGS, I'll have it soon                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kobayashi" title="Kobayashi"><img alt="Kobayashi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://zadkin.free.fr/logoBaveuse2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kobayashi">Kobayashi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179698/#Comment_179698" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-21T12:41:35+00:00" title="November 21, 2008 12:41PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just got mine, I think the back cover lurb says it all :<br/><br/><i>Here superstition covers peoples'lives like autumn mists cover the moors and terrifying monsters with bizarre powers lurk in the shadows.

Great layout too.<br/><br/>still can't roll up stats good enough for an Assassin !                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180418/#Comment_180418" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-26T05:37:03+00:00" title="November 26, 2008  5:37AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've had a chance to read mine a bit more now and it's shocking how much<br/><br/>(a) it brings back fond memories<br/><br/>(b) I could never ever run it as written<br/><br/>B is not a matter of rules (although some of them bug me looking back at them) but setting (the rules about not being able to sell magic items make no in-game sense at all) and most of all intent. The idea that I as a GM would take someone's character background and change it without their say-so such that they were suddenly a childhood kidnap victim with a strange tattoo ... no way. Just too much "GM messing with the players because his story is more important than theirs" for me.<br/><br/>Also, I haven't sat down and compared this to the Corgi editions but there are surely less illustrations. Like no diagram of lighting in corridors, or falling from cliffs, or opening doors.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
