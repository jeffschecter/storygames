I only did okay with this game, and I wish I would have had more time to read the Monster of the Week book beforehand, especially because I had some Apoc World veterans as a part of the group. Still, I think there was fun had (I had some fun!). The Team consisted of a college-society related to a University in New England that focused on Psychology. We had a Monster that taught Gaelic Studies (and could pass for human), a Flake that lived in the dorms, a Professional that was a member of the FDA's policing force on-site due to the cafeteria, a Spooky with a magical tapeworm that talked to them, an Expert that taught at the University and a Mundane that was another student. <br/><br/>Summary:<br/>We started with a link to a murder at a toy store, which didn't stir too much interest. I asked the group what would cause them to investigate, and they gave me a lead, so we worked that in. However, the group took a bit to come together as their roles dictated different actions a bit. The first investigation led them to a second toy store where they interrupted another murder from taking place. The group discovered these "little girl" minions attacking a clerk, and dispatched one and trapped the other using their Mundane's van. They then tried to talk to it, and ended up talking to the Brood Mother through her psychic link. The group split up, with some heading "back to the lab", and others using the psychic link to track the little girls back to their origin - a satellite facility operated by one of the Expert's colleague back at the University. They made their way in, and started fighting the Mother, while the minions were alerted to the Expert's haven and tried to attack him back at home. We rushed the ending due to time. <br/><br/>Thoughts:<br/>I liked Monster of the Week a lot, and think it's a cool tool. I originally got it confused when people around PDX were talking about Monsterhearts, and thought they were one and the same, but they're not. I'd really like to try this as a bit of an ongoing series though, where we have more time. The Mundane and the Flake have to be my favorite playbooks ever, just because of the awesome shenanigans they put you into - such as the Mundane going off and getting into trouble, or the Flake asking for advice, getting it, and doing the opposite. <br/><br/>TL,DR: Fun game made less fun by my inexperience and time requirement, but still fun was had! Definitely an awesome game powered by Apoc World.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mr%20Nay" title="Mr Nay"><img alt="Mr Nay" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/273/nRUY5LGFSSBD3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mr%20Nay">Mr Nay</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386240/#Comment_386240" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-02T13:01:00+00:00" title="August  2, 2012  1:01PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Monster of the Week is definitely a fun game, I needed a good read through to understand the system before I dared run it.<br/>In saying that I found MotW much clearer than Apocalypse World.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386249/#Comment_386249" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-02T14:11:28+00:00" title="August  2, 2012  2:11PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, I'm glad you had fun, even if there were a few missteps. <br/><br/>I love the Spooky with magical tapeworm... ick!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386252/#Comment_386252" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-02T15:02:44+00:00" title="August  2, 2012  3:02PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played in this game with Bryan, and I definitely have some thoughts about it, but Bryan, I'm wondering, what sort of response are you looking for in this thread?
