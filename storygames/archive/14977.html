But I am starting to think that I don't really know how to play or to enjoy freeform scenes or freeform sections of scenes.<br/><br/>By "freeform" I mean the part were we freely roleplay or narrate stuff.<br/><br/>Is there some techniques, that help enjoying more those scene or to get the best out of them?<br/><br/>I ask, because often I feel like I am left hanging in empty space, with no real technique or guideline when a game ask me to freely narrate or roleplay a scene.<br/><br/>For example:<br/><br/>Remember Tomorrow: My character is car racing a other character, before using the dice we freely narrate the scene, but it quickly felt kind of silly or awkward. We were narrating stuff, but we dint really knew how enjoy it or what to enjoy. Same thing happened with a gun fight, after describing some action it felt kind of awkward. <br/><br/>Trail of Cthulhu: A player play a quiet scene to refresh his character abilities pool, to do so his character visit the zoo with her daughter. We all liked the idea of the scene, but even when keeping it short, we din't really knew what to look for to enjoy it. We narrated some stuff, felt unsure, and closed the scene. But it felt like a letdown, like we missed something, and as the GM I noticed that I din't really knew how to play this scene beside just describing/narrating stuff. <br/><br/><br/>I know it kind of "natural" to know how to do this, like we take for granted that everyone know how to do to it. I agree, but how do we get good or better at freely narrating scenes? What should we look for while we freely narrate? Is there some fun things to do? Interesting way to interact? Techniques to employ, etc.?<br/><br/>(any good game text, articles, post, etc discussing this?)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Skywalker" title="Skywalker"><img alt="Skywalker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Skywalker">Skywalker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340543/#Comment_340543" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-25T21:21:30+00:00" title="August 25, 2011  9:21PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2011 9:22PM by Skywalker.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            - Keep the scenes short and to the point.

Just because a scene is freeform doesn't mean it is purposeless -- a scene can seem like a good idea, but you have to figure out what it's 'about' or it will likely fall flat.<br/><br/>So you have an idea for a scene where the PC visits the zoo with her daughter -- that's a great start, but it's going to help a lot to think it out a little further in terms of what this scene is going to contribute to the fiction, to the larger story. Is the scene going to help us learn more about the PC? Is it going to set up the daughter as a vulnerable, potential future victim? Is it going to provide contrast to the intensity of other scenes, or is it going to include lots of foreshadowing and ominous bits to attempt to build on that intensity?<br/><br/>If you have a strong idea of the function of the scene in terms of the larger story/fictional world, that tends to make it a lot easier to figure out what to focus on once you're actually playing out the scene.<br/><br/>I am actually pretty terrible at this, myself, due in part to a long history of playing in online games where 95% of scenes were basically pointless -- exercises in time-filling and showy writing. But if you can't figure out beforehand what sort of things a scene is going to reveal about your characters, or the world, or the story, it might not be a good idea for a scene.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340549">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340549/#Comment_340549" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-25T22:16:03+00:00" title="August 25, 2011 10:16PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OMG!

But on the square.)<br/><br/>All of the above advice is actually pretty good. I'll toss in something that may be of use.<br/><br/>Someone needs to be a Trouble Maker, even in a peaceful scene meant to flesh out a character.<br/><br/>Despite some interpretations of the Czege Principle, it really can be the player of the main character in the scene. Sometimes that's exactly the best person to be the Trouble Maker.<br/><br/>A Trouble Maker can introduce low intensity/low stakes conflicts. Sideline players should still be able to offer suggestions on trouble for main characters in a scene, and leave it up to the main players in the scene to take up or ignore or bring into play however they wish.<br/><br/>The other thing I'd suggest is just plain having other players play up characters in the scene. A quiet, low conflict stakes scene is an opportunity to play up and portray your character even more fully, so do it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eldir" title="Eldir"><img alt="Eldir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i182.photobucket.com/albums/x208/loki_laufeysson/goplay_dotted_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eldir">Eldir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340552/#Comment_340552" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-25T22:49:17+00:00" title="August 25, 2011 10:49PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One word: Conflict. I third the advice that having a clear sense of purpose makes a scene stronger. In addition, ideally, all scenes should revolve around conflicts. You know the usual rundown--conflicts can be external or internal, interpersonal or collective or against nature, physical or emotional or what have you.<br/><br/>If a scene sags, that's most likely because it doesn't have conflict or the conflict is uninteresting. For best results, the conflict should be ones that push characters that the audience (players) care about into a meaningful choice. So if there's a) no conflict, b) the characters are uninteresting, c) there is no build-up to a choice that matters to the character or story, the scene will feel unsatisfying from a dramatic point of view.<br/><br/>It's kind of a tall order for scenes in a roleplaying game to fulfill these elements every single time. Heck, professionally written stories don't always hit the mark. But having meaningful conflict in every scene is a good goal to strive for, and is pretty much guaranteed to make the game stronger as a story.<br/><br/>So, take car race: Who's racing? Do we know and care about the characters? What's the relationship between the racers? What's at stake, is it something one or more of the characters care about--ego, status, money, women, safety, life? Is there a meaningful choice to be made, character-wise or plot-wise? For instance, will the character have to choose between victory and the possibility of risking life and limb? Is there something else the character could be doing, such as date or a rescue, and which is more important to him, that or winning the race? What does the choice tell us about the character?<br/><br/>Taking your daughter to the zoo: I love this kind of scene because it can be such a gold mine. What are the character and daughter like? What is their relationship like? What is the relationship between the character and the other parent, if there is one? What's the conflict--divorce, marital troubles, financial troubles, illness on the daughter's part, the father's (assuming male) own ambivalence about fatherhood? What's at stake with this visit--is the character trying to be a good father, carving out some time to talk to his daughter alone, preparing to leave her for a while, does he want to distract her from her difficulties, is he trying to quiet the treacherous inner voice that resents his daughter's existence? What choice will he have to make--will he be called away to a job or will some other reason to terminate the time with his daughter present itself? Will he run into his current lover, encounter people whom he doesn't want his daughter to see, will he have to reveal his real identity when the daughter is kidnapped? What will the choice reveal about him?<br/><br/>From a dramatic point of view good scenes start with good characters, by which I mean believable and textured fictional people who want something that they are willing to work to get. Then it's just a matter of dropping them into situations where they have to make choices that matter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340575/#Comment_340575" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-26T04:24:38+00:00" title="August 26, 2011  4:24AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Cedric P</cite>how do we get good or better at freely narrating scenes?</blockquote>\nMy best advice would be to play more games with more people. Playing with someone who does something you really like makes you better at that particular thing, too. <br/><br/>Also, not every scene needs to be a scintillating gem redolent with meaning and fraught with tough choices. Sometimes its "I need a refresh so I take my daughter to the zoo. OK, moving on."

Usually in Fiasco, this can be averted by having the group make the scene and having them end it.  However, I've run into a type of player that will diffuse any conflict in the scene.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTo take an example similar to one that I believe is in the Fiasco Companion, let's say that there is Albert the Fish, an aging ex-hitman who's trying to get out of the business.  The other players set up a scene where he's given the chance to get out for good, if only he rubs out his last target: his own nephew.  Now this player takes his turn, and takes a white dice, then narrates a scene where he gets a call back from his contact saying that his nephew has just paid off his debts and now there's no need to kill him.  The other players groan and the every scene involving this player lose their tension, and the player doesn't understand why they aren't contributing to the game.  Even after explaining the need for conflict, they just can't help but avoid any conflict where possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat would you do with a player like this?  In my case, I have tried explaining what sort of game Fiasco is, but they hadn't ever seen any Cohen Bros. movies, but they were still keen on giving it a try.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340578/#Comment_340578" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-26T05:22:51+00:00" title="August 26, 2011  5:22AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That dude is shifting the goalposts, and it's OK to call him on that. If he wants out of the life, a positive outcome is "he's out of the life" and a negative outcome is "he's still in the life". The cost of that is sort of ancillary. So if his nephew pays back his debt (totally fine for him to declare this), that's a negative outcome - he's still in the life because there's no last job to do - yet. Find him an even worse last job next time.<br/><br/>Regardless, your friend is oblivious to the engine that makes the game go here and that goes way beyond using free narration well, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340580/#Comment_340580" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-26T06:23:45+00:00" title="August 26, 2011  6:23AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 26, 2011 8:06AM by Todd_L.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            post swallowed by cut&amp;paste error.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340581">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340581/#Comment_340581" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-26T06:41:54+00:00" title="August 26, 2011  6:41AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 26, 2011 6:51AM by Ry.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I'm in a campaign that usually starts in this crappy townhouse courtyard, the PCs tend to just chat and catch up in character a bit.

If something interesting comes up, that's great, but if not, don't sweat it, call the scene, and move on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340602/#Comment_340602" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-26T08:58:31+00:00" title="August 26, 2011  8:58AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whenever we narrate freeform scenes they are about explaining things that happened on other parts of the game. Say, in the middle of a combat, the paladin rolls a crtical hit. After the battle, he can narrate how at that moment he had an ephiphany and heard the voice oh his god calling to him, and saw where he had to strike. Or the technician rolls a fumble and later he narrates how he realizes his tools were totally uncalibrated, so now all that happened during the combat makes sense. Making sense out of the dice outcomes isn't only the work of the GM, you can also help a lot there, as long as you don't interrupt the flow of the story or completely change its direction.<br/><br/>Freeform scenes can also be used to prepare your character for the challenges ahead, either in a physical or mental way. Like narrating how your barbarian is trying to keep his cool before the battle and starts to argue about religion with the priest of the party to keep his mind away from the upcoming battle. Again, it's something that doesn't change the direction of the story, that's something that -at least in traditional games- is left to the GM, the mechanics of the game or the group of players.<br/><br/>Now, if the freeform scenes are meant for having the player come up with a chamge in the story, that's where te term "collaborative" comes in play. It means all the players are helping each other to make a story. You can't thus go and play safe avoiding conflict and expect everybody think that's fun because you're comfortable with it. These games are most of time about getting into trouble and then getting out of it or burning your character in the flames of glory. But then again that's when it's all about the story, not about the characters survival, but about roleplaying the attitude of your character towards the conflict and everything that it`s at risk.<br/><br/>I agree with Scott, if the player avoids conflict, it's the job of the GM and the rest of the players to bring it back somehow, if the mechanics of the game don't force it back.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P" title="Cedric P"><img alt="Cedric P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img39.imageshack.us/img39/7180/opticnerve8s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P">Cedric P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340603/#Comment_340603" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-26T08:59:05+00:00" title="August 26, 2011  8:59AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 26, 2011 9:01AM by Cedric P.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I knew that my interrogations were maybe confusing or vague since I have some difficulty to identify and to express them clearly.<br/><br/>I will try to elaborate a little bit.<br/><br/>I think that I am used to enjoy freeform narration as a tool to engage game system stuff. Like if I have to showcase a trait to activate it for my dice roll at the end of a scene I have fun doing it, or if I am gaming to feature some stuff in the fiction, to push some other character button, etc. I know how to do it and more importantly I have fun while doing it. <br/><br/>I think that when I have some objectives related to the game system to give me a goal while freely narrating a scene I usually enjoy playing the scene.   <br/><br/>But when I don't have this or when there is no real link or incidence between narrating and later engaging the game system, I feel like I am playing in a sandbox video-game, like minecraft, where I don't know what to build, what to do or what to enjoy. <br/><br/>What I am looking for is stuff to do or to enjoy while we are playing and freely narrating a scene. I mean stuff to do as a player, not in the fiction. <br/>Like I found very interesting the part about asking questions in AW, it seem like a fun way to interact with freely narrated scene.  <br/>I am searching fur stuff like this to do, kind of like self-invented "game" we play when we freely narrate. <br/><br/>I don't think it a question about how to frame scene, to find interesting conflicts or when to cut the scenes. I think that me and me group we usually menage well those things now.<br/><br/>It really when we are in the scene, right now, in the middle of it, and freely narrating for the sake of it, we don't know where to look for the fun in "playing" with the scene.<br/><br/><br/>Well I don't know, maybe it not really a issue or something. It just that recently I had two game experiences that made me wonder if I was missing something:<br/><br/>There was a game of Remember Tomorrow where we played a whole episode in one session and it really felt awkward or even maybe boring to freely narrate or roleplay most of the scenes beside that we found those scene interesting when we framed them. We were even surprised at the end of the session, when we talked back about the game, that when we relate what happened in the game that it gave us a cool fiction while at the same time playing it was kind of boring.  <br/><br/>Later, on a other forum, a group used to play traditional games and who enjoy to play interpersonal conflicts while not touching the dice and who I guess, enjoy just to "roleplay", posted that they were trying Remember Tomorrow and they took 3 sessions to play a single episode and had a blast and told us that RT was one of the best storygame they have tried. Me and my group we were puzzled. We were like "wow, what are we missing? how do they play those scenes?? We also want to have fun with those freely narrated scenes!"<br/><br/><br/>The second experience was yesterday, a session of Trail of Cthulhu. Most of the session was clue finding with a lot of freeform roleplaying and narration. Again many scene felt awkward to narrate and at the end of the session we were kind of puzzled. We were like: ok finding clue is kind of fun, but should we have been doing something else while playing? Like getting immersed in our character or something? We tried to play some personal scene like the scene in the zoo, but again it was like we din't really how to have fun with those scenes. Framing those scene and why we where framing them was not a problem, some of them had conflict in them some other where exposition of stuff like source of stability. Those scenes seemed interesting at the start, It was really when we where in the middle of them that we suddenly din't know what to do to enjoy them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eldir" title="Eldir"><img alt="Eldir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i182.photobucket.com/albums/x208/loki_laufeysson/goplay_dotted_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eldir">Eldir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340609/#Comment_340609" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-26T09:15:33+00:00" title="August 26, 2011  9:15AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 26, 2011 9:15AM by Eldir.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite><br/>Also, not every scene needs to be a scintillating gem redolent with meaning and fraught with tough choices.

I understand inmersion, I understand the fun in creating an story (I'm a comic creator and I tried a few story-games), I can even get to the idea of lonely fun where a player roleplays a character that isn't exactly affecting the story in either a possitive or negative way, but it's just there enjoying him/herself. But now I'm quite intrigued by this (seriously)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Cedric P</cite>I<br/>Well I don't know, maybe it not really a issue or something.

Perhaps it's got something to do with the amount of things you had to come up with as players? Like, what elements did you had to start narrating the scene? There was already a described location? Did each player had to come up with just the details or had to made up the location from almost zero? What about the characters in the location? Well, we could start piling up data for every item present but I doublt that would be fun unless at least some items had something emotional attached to them, in a way that made the characters react. That reaction would be interesting, even if it doesn't have a goal or affects the story otherwise.<br/><br/>Now, if you can get your character express an emotion and elicit other emotions on the rest of NPCs, that gets even better. However I'm still unsure of what you're expecting from those scenes, probably as much as you. What was in it for those RT players that made an episode last for 3 sessions?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340619/#Comment_340619" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-26T10:48:38+00:00" title="August 26, 2011 10:48AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 26, 2011 10:52AM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Cedric P</cite>But when I don't have this or when there is no real link or incidence between narrating and later engaging the game system, I feel like I am playing in a sandbox video-game, like minecraft, where I don't know what to build, what to do or what to enjoy.<br/><br/>What I am looking for is stuff to do or to enjoy while we are playing and freely narrating a scene. I mean stuff to do as a player, not in the fiction.</blockquote>\nI think there's at least two main options here: focusing on the craft, or focusing on the fiction.<br/><br/>By focusing on the craft, I mean that one thing you could do as a player is try and push yourself to do a really good job at something, like: this scene I'm going to talk in character and practice my accent; or this scene I'm going to try and really demonstrate my character's emotions through acting and description; or this scene I'm going to focus on adding lots and lots of detailed description about the scenery; or I always seem to rush through scenes, so this scene I'm going to focus on slow, deliberate pacing. Or on really driving towards conflict, or focus on pushing other characters, or really on any single thing that you want to get 'better' at when it comes to playing scenes in general.<br/><br/>There's lots of crossover with the second thing, focusing on the fiction, because of course the fiction is generally the medium in which you are practicing your craft as a player, and your contributions to the fiction are ultimately governed by the limits of your craft. But, the main distinction in focusing on the fiction is it's a lot more like the AW mode of asking questions: instead of picking something you want to get better at, as a player, you pick something you want to know more about in the fiction. So like: in this scene I'm really going to try and develop details about Victorian class structure; or in this scene I'm going to find out what this PC really thinks about her daughter; or in this scene I'm going to highlight my character's personal beliefs about God; or in this scene I'm going to try and really emphasize how poor most people are; or in this scene I'm going to try and figure out why my PC hates his brother so much. Basically, pick something to be curious about, or pick something you 'know about' as a player but want to see come into the fiction more.<br/><br/>I think just picking one of these sort of focuses per scene can really be enough to keep it interesting for you -- and assuming you pick one with the rest of the group in mind, it should also make the scene more interesting for everyone. If everyone in the scene is driving towards something then that's going to help build momentum and enjoyment on the immediate, what-is-happening-in-our-play level, regardless of whether the scene was perfectly framed or not (and as you say, it sounds like that part is not a problem.)<br/><br/>I mean, when there's no mechanics at work in a scene then it's pretty clear there's only two broad categories of things that are going to keep things interesting: the players and the fiction. So if you try and make yourself a better player, or you try and make a better fiction, that's going to make a better scene -- and by picking some specific version of 'better' that you want, it will help keep you focused on that goal instead of getting overwhelmed by all the possibilities.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340627/#Comment_340627" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-26T11:18:59+00:00" title="August 26, 2011 11:18AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This phrase has become my best friend: "Tell me what that looks like."

I do something, you react to it, I react to your reaction, and now we're sharing a spotlight and having a great time.  Plus, most of the time, we're both in-character for it, which is always a blast.<br/><br/>Narration, on the other hand, isn't particularly fun.  I know what I'm going to say and all I get to do is say it while other people watch.  It's a spotlight just on me, no surprises for me.  Booo-ring.  I don't even really get to be in-character, which drops all the fun performance aspects of doing a soliloquy.<br/><br/><br/>I think it's narration, more than anything else, that made me not really enjoy Primetime Adventures when our group played it.  It always seemed like scenes went from the really good part where things were happening and we were all having fun, eventually leading to an interesting conflict that we were all interested in seeing...and then someone would get stuck with having to narrate the conclusion to it, which even at its very best was never as much fun as the interaction that preceded it.  And if I was the one who had to do the narration, then I didn't even get to enjoy seeing a good narrative conclusion as an audience.  Honestly, it drove me away from participating in conflicts in that game entirely, just so I couldn't get roped into doing that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
