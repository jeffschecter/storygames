No other preparation is necessary.<br/><br/><span style="font-family: Georgia;"><b><i><span style="color: #660000;">We are ...</span></i></b></span><br/>We are old. Our lives have been long. Our loved ones have died. We are gathered here and now, to walk down memory lane, toward those golden times around the year 2008.  <i><b>Here </b></i>is exactly where we are. <i><b>Now </b></i>is exactly 30 years into the future.<br/><br/>We are ourselves, thirty years older, and with the loss of all our loved ones in the baggage; wifes, sweethearts, brothers, sisters, children. The only ones left to us in the <b><i>now </i></b>of this game, is ourselves, us; a group of old friends gathered here today.<br/><br/>Our friendships goes back at least thirty years. We have been through a lot together.<br/><br/><span style="font-family: Georgia;"><b><i><span style="color: #660000;">The Changes</span></i></b></span><br/>The changes has been frightening, and in some cases: violent. The world is a harsher place now, dominated by a new superpower: China, and it's totalitarian influence in both commercial and political spheres.<br/><br/>USA has broken up into thirty single states and small confederations, each of them struggling with the aftereffects of the economic breakdown around 2013, and none of them getting any help from a world-community with no interest in "weak" nations. the whole twin continents of <i>The Americas</i> has gone down with USA, in a chaotic disintegration of all that held these continents a place for happy people.<br/><br/>Europe went down with the economic crisis too, triggering a wave of unrest and riots around the continent, ending some years later with the resurgence of fascism. Some pockets of democracy still persist, but lets face it: democracy has been out of fashion the last twentyfive years. The fascist states are little more than robber-baronies, squabbling over the remains of a dead civilization.<br/><br/>Africa is a total human catastrophe, going through what can be described as a second colonial era, with cynical Chinese entrepreneurs plundering the continent for resources. The continent is a quagmire of sickness, hunger and social disintergration, with no real states to talk about, a tragedy continued from it's unbelievable harsh history. A history devoid of hope.<br/><br/>The Middle-East has seen no changes, and that in itself is a tragedy. From Pakistan to Morocco the Persian/Arabic/Islamic-peoples suffers like ever before, struggling with fanaticism, tribe-wars and an ongoing conflict with the religious theocracy of the highly militaristic Israel. The political paranoia and social psychopathy of the Islamic peoples continues to grow.<br/><br/>China and it's neighbors; Korea, Japan, Vietnam, Indonesia and India; are the new developed countries, experiencing wealth and happiness like no other place on earth ever. The new technologies developed in these countries, and their military might, has ensured an unpolluted world where no powers threatens their hegemony. No polluting industry is permitted, neither in Asia, nor on other continents. The Asian economies are growing towards heaven under the new production-paradigm, powered by wind and wave and solar-energy. The Asian peoples dominate the world at large, as far as they care to involve themselves in the chaotic <i>Rest-World</i>. Their compassion is not high, with old super- and colonial-powers.<br/><br/><span style="font-family: Georgia;"><b><i><span style="color: #660000;">The Club</span></i></b></span><br/>We, the friends, sit here now, in our annual gathering, our "club" named <i><b>Nostalgia</b></i>. We have gathered here to remind ourselves of better times, when life was normal and times where happy.<br/><br/>The club has had more members, but many has succumbed to evil times; <i><b>hunger, plague, war and violence</b></i>. We are the ones left. This club is our last sanctuary, a way for us to escape the harsh reality, by talking about the happy days back then, in the beginning of the millenium, around 2008.<br/><br/>We will talk about all good thing of the past, and try to avoid talking about the changes and the present. All we say about the changes and the present are unwanted, and will be met with sharp glares and short reminders on what Nostalgia is all about; this is a club for happy memories! All we say about the past, the happy days, are true and will be met with nodding, supportive sounds, or positive comments. The sorrows we express, over lost ones, will be met with understanding. We all have them. But we generally refrain from delving on the sorrows. They are too many.<br/><br/>We will talk until, one by one, we grow silent. One by one we will turn our attention inwards, on loss and sorrow and anxiety. And we will sit silent until all have quieted. Then we will, one by one, let out a heavy sigh.<br/><br/>When all have filled the silence with a sigh, the game is over.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_148701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148701/#Comment_148701" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-07T01:27:09+00:00" title="June  7, 2008  1:27AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This game is posted as a kick off for a serious discussion on life/world-changing games.<br/><br/>My questions:<br/><b>- Can games be used for social and/or political purposes?</b><br/><b>- Is it possible to enact changes in the real world through the use of great game-design?</b><br/><b>- May games be used to change our lives?</b><br/><br/>I do not intend to discuss our lust for or will to change the world through games.

The game is giving a sketchy (at best) picture of the world 30 years into the future, but has China dominating a world very much in agony. To discuss an uncertain future as such, is not the purpose of this thread, or the game. The purpose of "The Change"-chapter, is to create a dark backdrop to the dialog of the players. And their dialog is set up to focus on our world and life today.<br/><br/>I have read and played several of the games on your shortlist, Ben. They are fairly well known, and great games.

I'm having a hard time coming up with any RPGs that have made any significant change to the world, aside from maybe D&amp;D and the computer spinoffs it inspired.  But I don't know if that's the social change looked for here.  <br/><br/>I think the games on Ben's list may have changed individual <i>lives</i>, but I'm not sure how any of them have brought about examples of socio-political change.

Science fiction seems uniquely positioned, in may ways, to reflect the social ills and joys of the real world.  Also, historical games (often about war) like Grey Ranks, Carry, and Emily's <a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/category/a-day-in-the-war/" rel="nofollow">A Day in the War</a> do similar things.<br/><br/>I've tinkered with this a bit too, though not using scifi or war as themes.<br/><br/>- <a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/projects/mwaantaangaand/" rel="nofollow">Mwaantaangaand</a><br/>- <a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/2008/03/27/lions-in-the-snow-mountains/" rel="nofollow">Lions in the Snow Mountains</a><br/><br/>The way we develop this trend further is making and playing more games like this.  Honestly, though, I think life- and world-changing play often happens regardless of the game or system people are playing with.  I think you can design games in such as way as to make them explicitly reference real-world issues, but you have to be careful in how you approach it, so it's not preachy or doesn't have the answers already predetermined before play starts.  Good games in this vein make solving real problems the fruitful void and watch players and their characters struggle with trying to fill it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_148721">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148721/#Comment_148721" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-07T06:24:00+00:00" title="June  7, 2008  6:24AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 7, 2008 6:25AM by TomasHVM.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>Good games in this vein make solving real problems the fruitful void and watch players and their characters struggle with trying to fill it.</blockquote>I second that!

You are right, of course; great game design can change the world, and so may any RPG, on the individual level. I have a folder called "Fanmail" on my computer, for my classical FRPG Fabula, and that folder is full of mail from people telling me how Fabula changed their lives, how it was important for them, how great it was to discover RPGs in the bookstore. This kind of experience underlies all gameplay; the revelation of our ability to create engaging stories, and to institute personal growth by doing so.<br/><br/>This thread, however, is purposed to focus on games with an <i>agenda </i>to change the world or life of people playing it. My game Fabula has never been such a game; it's simple aim is to entertain, as every classical RPG out there. I would like to discuss modern games here, which at some level has been designed to institute change within a field of life, a sphere of our real world.<br/><br/>I believe such games to be possible, and I believe it possible to design them to be fun/exciting/challenging! I believe the strong forces at play through interactive gameplay are ideal for humans to make their own revelations about their life and the world.<br/><br/><b>How would you make such a game?<br/>- without preaching<br/>- with engaging gameplay<br/>- on a theme that lends itself to interaction<br/>- in a way that makes people play it</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_148918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148918/#Comment_148918" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-08T22:11:44+00:00" title="June  8, 2008 10:11PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            May I ask for it to be considered that, if a game design were to change the world, we wouldn't notice for at least a decade (for instance, playing spione changes your political beliefs: okay, but for that to filter up takes a while...)

I am inclined to believe that one-session games are most <i>easily </i>made to cater for change within one part of our life or the world. But I do believe that campaign-style games may be interesting, especially in relation to a broader approach. It may be possible to make games beneficial to humans in several ways, as a tool to change your life completely, through a series of game-session, or as a tool to raise the political awareness of a group over time. It may be possible to create games that simulates the workings of politics to the degree that they influence both <i>how we do</i> politics, and what politics we make.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_148932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148932/#Comment_148932" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-08T23:06:47+00:00" title="June  8, 2008 11:06PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 8, 2008 11:07PM by Ben_Lehman.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>I do not expect my proposed game to have any geopolitical implications.

Let's talk about that here, Ben.</i><br/><br/>Okay, but let's take as an assumption that it does work to change people's lives, personally. The vehicle by which their lives will be changed is a fiction that enhances commonly-held and wildly incorrect stereotypes about Asia. So if my life is changed by something that contains those stereotypes, I'm more like to carry them myself unknowingly, simply out of habit or respect for the fiction that changed my life. In this way, if your game works the way you want it to, it also has the effect of reifying various untrue stereotypes.<br/><br/>Not saying this is good or bad: you may want your game to serve as propoganda.

These games may be hard to make, without implying some view on the world at large. To be aware of such implications makes for a smarter designer, I believe.<br/><br/>I do not see how my game <b>Nostalgia </b><i>"enhances commonly-held and wildly incorrect stereotypes about Asia"</i> in any significant way. None of the speculations given on Asia is meant as more than quite improbable ideas. They play on present stereotypes, yes, as do the description of other continents too, but these ideas would be recognized as pure speculation by any man of normal faculties in Norway. I do admit to being a bit over the top in this description, as the game is meant to focus on personal themes, not political ones. As you may notice the game text say this on commenting the in-game "present": <i>... will be met with sharp glares and short reminders on what Nostalgia is all about; this is a club for happy memories!</i><br/><br/>To make "political forecasts" like this are, of course, very hard without making some kind of statement on the present state of the world.

China is <i>so</i> messed up these days, it's not even funny.  Thirty years away from utopia and peaceful coexistence with its neighbors?  It would take them thirty years just to <i>start</i> dealing with the problems they're having now, they certainly wouldn't have solved any of them.<br/><br/>But that's beside the point.  You could just as easily search-and-replace "China" with an entirely fictional nation, even one that's basically China in a cheap costume, and by doing so you'd neatly sidestep the whole issue without (I think) noticeably blunting whatever effects you're trying to achieve.  After all, your goal isn't to say "rah rah China's gonna get its shit together and be awesome someday," it's to...er...well, get whatever it is you're going for.  I'm afraid I'm not entirely clear on what exactly that might be, sorry.<br/><br/><br/>Anyway, the sticking point as I see it for the various goals you've suggested (the serious intent, the potential to change lives/society, etc.) is that the game has to be played, and it will have to be played by people who want those things, too.  You as a developer sitting at your keyboard can want it as hard as you like.  You can cross your fingers, whisper prayers, stamp your feet, yell, plead, and whatever else you think might help...but what people take away from the game you wrote is always going to depend on what they wanted to take away from it.  You're not going to trick them into it; no matter how crystal-clear you make your intentions in the text you wrote, you don't get any say in what happens in their game or what (if anything) they'll get out of it.<br/><br/>(But the flip side is also true: if they have the serious intent and the desire to be changed and/or promote change, they'll do it, and you could maybe write the game so that those people have a nice toolkit of things to use towards those goals which they might not have thought of on their own, and <i>that</i> would be pretty good game design.

That's the gist of the game.<br/><br/>I may need to state a bit stronger that my specualations on the future is made entirely to serve as a backdrop for the game, and not as a political statement (at least not a serious one).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148959/#Comment_148959" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-09T04:26:00+00:00" title="June  9, 2008  4:26AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's interesting that you mention Shakespeare, because the corollorary of the question "can games change the world" is surely "can art change the world" or "can fiction change the world", to which the answer is most certainly yes, it can, and has done many times.<br/><br/>So if fiction can change the world then surely games that create fiction have the same potential to do so as a great novel, or film, or play?<br/><br/>Perhaps not. What a great novel offers to its readers is a participation in a particular fiction, which is disseminated into the minds of many people, and changes their perception of the world. Although one individual reader may take slightly different things away from the fiction than another, because their own experiences of the world differ, <i>en mass</i> all readers read much the same thing, and with sufficient meaning, and sufficient numbers, that can change cultures, as Shakespeare has.<br/><br/>Games, however, give people a toolkit to produce their own stories, which makes for a deeply personal, wonderful, but also disconnected experience. My life can be changed by an RPG (and has been, more than once), but it will not be changed like yours is. On a cultural level a given roleplaying game is more like a writing technique than a book, and has effects on culture that are as hard to quantify as the invention, say, of the quatrain or the novella. The effects are significant, but you'd be hard pressed to say what they were exactly.<br/><br/>It's no surprise, perhaps, that the RPG with the greatest impact on popular culture, then, has been the one where the stories told are the most 'samey'. One archetypal D&amp;D dungeon crawl is much like another, and perhaps because of that universality they *have* changed our culture in a way that is visible in every Fantasy quest film, MMORPG, console fantasy adventure, and many fantasy novels. (The fact, i think, that those products have *also* been influenced by Tolkein, Lewis, other films, and what have you, is neither here not there, it just makes D&amp;D part of the same zeitgeist). Maybe a game with a fun, repeatable, consistent experience might have bigger effects than most RPGs? I don't know about that.<br/><br/>As an aside though I don't think there was any focussed "serious intent" behind most of Shakespeare's works. They were entertainment, often designed for short run hilarity and little else. The fact that they have become cultural cornerstones is more to do with history than design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_148960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148960/#Comment_148960" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-09T04:27:29+00:00" title="June  9, 2008  4:27AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 9, 2008 4:32AM by AccountingForTaste.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, stressing the "The politics are purely imaginary" part might be a good idea.

The control leaves your hands as soon as the manuscript gets into theirs, and what they do with the game is up to them.  Even explicitly saying "This is who the game is for and what they should get out of it, anyone else get the hell out" isn't necessarily going to guarantee that the people playing are going to be on the same page as you.<br/><br/><br/>So, here's an important question: what's the <i>game</i> in this?  So far this just sounds like people sitting in a circle pretending to be thirty years older and reminiscing about nice things they don't have anymore.  As a technique to encourage self-reflection, that's fine, but what else do the players do?  There's no dilemma facing them, there's no problems they need to address or overcome, there's no competition, there's no strategy, there's no goal, there's no required interaction between any of the participants, no reason to push any boundaries, no decisions to make, nothing to risk or to gain, no system to explore or apply...so what makes this a game?  What does this game design teach me that, say, writing a short story or a research paper wouldn't?

Yes; games is a method for creating your own "stories", but modern design has shown that the method by which you do this has great impact. The roleplaying game is not actually focused on <i>story </i>(sorry to say this here, in StoryGames). It is a game of conflicts/dilemmas/choice and consequence. The elements served to you, for you to play with, and the modes you are instructed to play in, are forcing you into the same dilemmas. All players are given the same apparatus of play to solve the dilemmas, aside from their own moral apparatus.<br/><br/>It is quite possible to focus your design, and through it; the experience had by the players. All my successful design has had this focus.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite>It's no surprise, perhaps, that the RPG with the greatest impact on popular culture, then, has been the one where the stories told are the most 'samey'.

It was the first RPG, and is the biggest, and that makes it an important game. The reason it had success was the carefree hack'n slash adventure style of it, and the novelty of "unfettered", interactive drama. The reason it has kept it's following is the consistent scenario-support of it, and  the inherent loyalty of the GM in classical RPGs ("I know this system, and feel clumsy in others"). This is not a big point, though, so let's not make it a point of debate. We can agree to disagree, if you <b>really do </b>disagree with me in this.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite>As an aside though I don't think there was any focussed "serious intent" behind most of Shakespeare's works.

The fact remains; the plays of S. are full of serious dilemmas, presented in an entertaining way. I did not say "serious design" had to be boring. I prefer it to be exciting, challenging, deeply disturbing, great fun.<br/><br/>So my answer to you, Hituro, is that focused and effective design is indeed possible. The public may be placed in the same dilemmas, with the same elements of play to help them, and be given very much the same experience of moral acuity through the gameplay. RPGs do not differ from other fields of art with respect to the artists possibility of influencing his audience.<br/><br/>The myth of "unfettered stories" has been thoroughly refuted, in my view. System matters. The gamesmith is in fact hammering his themes and dilemmas into us; the unsuspecting amateurs* of interactive drama.<br/><br/><i>* Amateur: a person loving what he is doing.</i><br/><br/>Taste, Brennen and Fnord: will have to come back to you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_149200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149200/#Comment_149200" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-10T00:23:31+00:00" title="June 10, 2008 12:23AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 10, 2008 12:24AM by TomasHVM.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tomas HVM</cite>The roleplaying game is not actually focused on<i>story</i>(sorry to say this here, in StoryGames).

I think there is some merit to Hituros description of it as "more like a writing technique than a book".<br/><br/>The novel has the pregenerated conflict, with its consequences, and makes a story out of it for you to read.<br/><br/>The RPG has the pregenerated <i>elements </i>of a conflict, with purposed consequences, and makes a method for you to play with these elements and possibilities.<br/><br/>The big difference is that the interaction of games offers an unique way of relating <i>actively </i>to the dilemmas of the drama. Good gameplay will ensure high engagement from the audience of the game. This mode of interaction is only present in very limited ways in other art-forms. That fact, however, does not make the interaction of games into some unlimited and totally unpredictable mode of behavior. There are rules to interaction, and ways of doing it that influence what the players will experience.

This is known, but not explored by gamesmiths in the RPG-industry. Through my recent forage into the unexplored landscape of serious game-design, I came up with the idea that it is possible to change the life of people through roleplaying games. As in: to make games that people play to get rid of angst, nervous disorder, traumas and other conditions which mainly has an emotional origin. To make games that set things straight in your life!<br/><br/>Neuro-linguistic programming is used to do this with great effect. I've tried it, and found that it had great similarities to some RPGs I've played. So my idea is actually out there already, only I've been so isolated with my game design (or submerged in the RL-isolation of the RPG-subculture), that I have had virtually no chance of spotting it, until I came up with the idea on my own.<br/><br/>I've been kind of reinventing the wheel (sigh). But as long as interactive gameplay is such a great invention, and I do have some extra features to add to the games we play for more than fun, I am quite proud of seeing the connection and acting on it. It has opened up whole new avenues of design-possibilities for me. This thread is one way of sharing them.<br/><br/>So Brennen: your joke is to the point!

The system ensures that I will have a game focussed on a future society, dominated by a significant change and the major issues surrounding it. That we will dive into this world and follow the stories of a number of characters whose lives are dominated by those issues, and that we will consider the challenges of how the characters approach them and use that as a mirror to our own concerns in the real world, whether they be identity, violence, poverty, age, or whatever. The tightly focussed design of the game controls what sort of story we will tell, and about what, and how we will approach it.<br/><br/>However my story is still not going to be yours. Our issues, shocks, resolutions, approaches and so on will be different. I can meet with you and talk a common language of techniques, maybe even of feelings (wonderment, excitement, fear for the future), but I cannot say to you "remember that bit where X happened ... how that is like what is happening in the world right now" because we didn't share X.<br/><br/>With books and films and plays people connect on that very fundamental level of discrete events, details that enter public consciousness and change the world, and the language we use. We don't talk about "futuristic surveillance societies" we talk about "big brother". We don't say "be my renaissance romanticized teenage lover" we say "be my romeo".<br/><br/>To me the constrained stories of focussed narrative design are still not enough for a universal symbol to easily arise. I think it did with D&amp;D not because it was so specially constrained (although lots of people *did* play specific published modules), but because the game was played so much that common traits started to emerge  that were universal enough to have an effect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_149207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149207/#Comment_149207" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-10T02:16:01+00:00" title="June 10, 2008  2:16AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 10, 2008 2:21AM by TomasHVM.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hituro: I've discussed scenarios I've played with people playing them in other groups, and the discussion has been very interesting. We have played the same scenario, and have dived into discussions on how the conflicts resolved differently. So we are in fact discussing the same work of art, only on the particular premises given by RPGs. This is <i>one </i>venue of discussion pertaining to <i>classical </i>RPGs, but not the only one. In relation to <i>modern </i>RPGs, which often comes with a tighter focus and are played in one game-session (not campaigning), the theme given by the gamesmith is even more dominating. And we may discuss it as any other work of art. Still: whether or not we may discuss it as such, does not pertain to the question of how it influence us.<br/><br/>The "discussion" of a RPG-theme is enclosed in the game itself, as part of it's method. We are in fact having a discourse on the theme given us by the game-designer, when playing the game.<br/><br/>The designer is delivering both premise and method for our discourse. it is not a free and unbound conversation. It is a fictional work with premade elements that we will play with according to a strict method. The elements of game-design are powerful tools in the hands of a skilled designer. The fact that most classical RPG-designers don't make use of them in a conscious way, is of no consequence.<br/><br/>So Hituro: I believe you need to accept the fact that it is possible to make a work of art in RPG-design, and to communicate particular ideas through it. Directed and affirmative game-design is possible. I have actually done it, and several other designers have too. I propose for you to, Hituro; either you let this be the end of our discussion, or you use your intellect on delving into the possibilities opening up when you accept directed design as a fact and exciting possibility.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149209/#Comment_149209" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-10T02:23:47+00:00" title="June 10, 2008  2:23AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But now you are talking about scenario design, and not game design, quite a different thing.<br/><br/>And on a different note, I am not sure where exactly I have caused you offence, but you seem to have decided to be very rude to me from the first word of your first reply (I was not aware that you could "butt in" on a public debate), and I am confused as to why.

One of them said it quite plain: "This game has changed my life. I think about death in a different manner now. I am not so afraid anymore". It took him two weeks to come forth and tell me that. On the night of the actual game-session he was, as was all of us, reluctant to talk much about the game.<br/><br/>The <i>how </i>is a bit complex to explain. It's like telling you what a book tells me. Most people will say: read it yourself. However; to give you some hints: the life-changing quality of this game has to do with how the game relate to death. The death of each and every character is a very plain element in it. It use their funerals as the frames for all scenes in the game, except one. By focusing each and every scene in the game on how the characters relate and evolve, and live their lives from youth to the very end, within a frame of funerals, makes for a very potent brew. By using the right methodic tools the potential of this brew is opened to the players.<br/><br/>A bit fluffy, this explanation, but I don't have time to go into more detail. I will describe some of the tools in the "Tools for change"-thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149248">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149248/#Comment_149248" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-10T06:36:16+00:00" title="June 10, 2008  6:36AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Tomas!

Some people jumped in right away to name games that they believe either HAVE changed lives/the world or have the potential to do so, but so far, until this latest post from you, no one has ever tried to give a concrete example of this.  It's all been talk about why they theoretically can or can't, which (at least to me) isn't nearly as interesting as real examinations of specific games and the play of those games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_149508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149508/#Comment_149508" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T00:02:42+00:00" title="June 11, 2008 12:02AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am in agreement with you; singularly theoretical discussions has limited value.

I think that there are three approaches, all of them relatively simple.<br/><br/>The first is to pick a topic that concerns you, then design a game around the issues of that topic, taking the whole thing seriously and researching the issues involved. This is like what you did at the start of the thread, but you would have to carry through and do the necessary setting research and take your material, even the smallest parts of it, seriously and be sure to get it all right, rather than tossing it off and going "well, this part is okay to be wrong, because it's not important to the main thrust of the game." Details are everything!<br/><br/>The second is to pick some material which is of deep interest to you, whether or not that material is "serious" in any way, and then, while designing it, take it as seriously as you can and do not shy away from serious human issues that crop up around it. You cannot know when you start what issues the game contains, but if the fiction around it is compelling, strong human issues will naturally emerge if you do not try to dismiss them, cover them up, or keep yourself in willful ignorance. Polaris is, to some degree, an example of this: to start I was simply inspired by several accomplished fantasists, and in the process of writing discovered issues of duty, loss, activism, and burn-out.<br/><br/>The last is to write a game in a cathartic mode: to fix problems in your own heart or at least examine or address them. In this case, taking your own work seriously is not an issue, because you will naturally do so: a mind will brook no attempts, even its own, at trivializing its own demons and concerns. Bliss Stage is primarily an example of this, despite its anime trappings, where I am seriously looking at my own problems about sexuality, memory, trauma, and social relationships stemming from being an abuse survivor and PTSD sufferer. The game needed to be written simply for my own survival. In my defense as a genre writer, many other entries into this genre come from the same source, including Evangelion, the most famous internationally.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_149512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149512/#Comment_149512" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T00:23:46+00:00" title="June 11, 2008 12:23AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice post, Ben!
