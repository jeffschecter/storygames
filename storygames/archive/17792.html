This probably made our game longer, but it didn't break it.<br/><br/>There was one situation that I didn't understand how to handle though. <br/><br/>Suppose you start a project whose outcome is not clear in advance (eg We wage war on the creatures from the toxic wastes // who wins?) or that requires the introduction of new fiction (eg We build a machine to force open the big vault on the side of the mountain // what is inside?). <b>When is the new fiction introduced and by whom?</b> By the player that removes the project die? By the player that initially created the project? By the first player that uses a Declare Something New move or that picks an appropriate card?<br/><br/>Thanks again for a great game<br/>--Ivan                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Saladdin" title="Saladdin"><img alt="Saladdin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Saladdin">Saladdin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402459/#Comment_402459" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-02T06:06:31+00:00" title="January  2, 2013  6:06AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            By the player that initially created the project, unless the project is removed early by a card (in that case, the player who draws the card must tell what happens)...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_402590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402590/#Comment_402590" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-03T13:32:41+00:00" title="January  3, 2013  1:32PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It is decided when the project is finished (in the "update project dice" step), by the player who started the project. There's a few cards that say a project finishes early. If they don't say anything else, I'd say the initiator still describes, but when the cards prompt then it's the one who drew the card. There's also one that tells the card-drawer to "radically change the nature of [a project]", and then that player counts as the initiator so that when it's eventually finished, they tell us how it worked out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402594/#Comment_402594" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-03T14:09:11+00:00" title="January  3, 2013  2:09PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>Saladdin is correct. It's whoever initiated the project, <i>unless</i> the project ends early as the result of a card, in which case it is the player who drew that card/chose that option. (The same goes for projects that fail as the result of a card; the player who drew the card should describe the failure.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
