It's called <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dO8hzxPoWlo3N7KN3SvibWi9DUErWsCDeLiURHlmYPc/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">Final Defense of the Quilombos</a>, and it's about the secret martial arts fortresses in the Amazon Rainforest in the seventeenth century (yes those were a real thing, not making this up). It's an action-adventure scenario which gives the players the power to change South American history forever.<br/><br/>I've never written a RPG module before, so I'm posting it here in the hopes of getting some feedback and advice about how I might revise it.

The different interpretations of Zumbi's character are always really fun, although he's forever going to look like Julia in my head.<br/><br/>Coalhada: Yeah, that myth is weird because the reality of most African martial training regimens incorporating a great deal of dance is actually cooler than the fiction. I should probably throw a bibliography in there in case people want to read up on that.<br/><br/>I want to play Malandros!<br/><br/>I've actually thought quite a bit about the possibility of powers tied to specific orix\xe2s. I have an idea for a Haitian Revolution scenario which will feature the loa prominently, with each player portraying a character as well as the loa possessing the character of the player to their right (\xe0 la shadowguides from Wraith). I'd like to see how the dynamic plays out there before I add it to this module, but I am excited to try it =D                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada" title="Coalhada"><img alt="Coalhada" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada">Coalhada</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430892/#Comment_430892" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-12T18:55:29+00:00" title="April 12, 2014  6:55PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Coalhada: Yeah, that myth is weird because the reality of most African martial training regimens incorporating a great deal of dance is actually cooler than the fiction.

I don't know if that book is where I'd send newcomers first though, because that opening chapter... oy.

The GM rolls difficulty dice into the <i>roda</i> - a circle in the centre of the table. Players have to beat that total, and they can also try to knock the GM's dice out of the roda when they roll. <br/><br/>The player characters are the <i>\xe1ureos</i> of the title. They're ex-slaves called and granted special powers by the <i>orixas</i> to free their people. One of the things you track in play is how many people you've attracted to your quilombo, and as that goes up, you wind up with more problems, but are also able to make a greater impact on the world. <br/><br/><br/><i>\xc1ureos</i> won the Fa\xe7a Voc\xea Mesmo competition in 2013 - there's a glowing review here: <a href="http://www.secular-games.com/2013/04/avaliacoes-fvm2013-aureos/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.secular-games.com/2013/04/avaliacoes-fvm2013-aureos/</a><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lula" title="Lula"><img alt="Lula" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/409/n3KBYVIFT76IM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lula">Lula</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432365/#Comment_432365" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-09T16:14:00+00:00" title="May  9, 2014  4:14PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is excellent!
