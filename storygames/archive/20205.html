Think almost <i>World of Dungeons</i> light, with FAE Approaches instead of stats, Fate Aspects instead of skills, Conditions (<i>Worlds in Peril</i>) instead of HP, and no classes.<br/><br/>Resolution would be the simple 10+, 7-9, 6- without any specific moves, a la <i>WoD</i>. Hard and soft GM moves. Aspects would work as per FAE, but Fate points would only bump up a 6- result to a 7-9, and would have to be spent <i>before</i> the dice are rolled. Invokes and Compels would work the same. High concept and trouble same as FAE. But it would be run like any Powered by the Apocalypse game with Agenda, Principles, and Moves.<br/><br/>My only real sticking point is how to do Bonds. My initial thought was to do them as another kind of Aspect rather than the fill-in-the-blank and rated stat of DW and WiP. I like Bonds conceptually, but not mechanically. Possibly have characters with two Bond Aspects. One to a PC and one to an important NPC. But fold those into the starting five or separate.<br/><br/>EDITED TO ADD LINKS:<br/><br/>Light version: <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13825925/Accelerated%20World.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13825925/Accelerated World.pdf</a><br/><br/>Ultra-light version: <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13825925/Infinite%20Worlds.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13825925/Infinite Worlds.pdf</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445632/#Comment_445632" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-12T05:09:11+00:00" title="June 12, 2015  5:09AM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Make it three bonds, depending on the game premise; in some settings, one bond to link the character to a location also makes wonders.

I loved Aspects too, but I really prefer to have a list of examples of cool skills and special powers for players to choose from (it helps a lot for players prone to blank page syndrome or paranoid GMs who fear their powergamer players)<br/><br/>From the japanese RPG Sworld World I liked how players could choose a race and two classes to make their characters quickly, so I made it even quicker by asking the players 3 concepts to broadly define their characters, and then to assign a few skills or special powers that fit each of those concepts. So you can play a Giant Hamster Blacksmith/Guardian and give it the skills "formidable strenght", "Lonsgsword", "Shield", "Armourer" and "Darkvision", and you're set. You get 6 other basic skills for free (the usual ones you need in any rpg like perception and atlethism), the equipment you need to use your skills 30 HP and that's it, the rest is the character background.<br/><br/>I liked the Burning Wheel concept for player created content, but it's so cumbersome that it takes a whole session to create the world; then I saw Dogs in the Vineyard and realized that all I needed was a few questions and some dice rolling. In the first playtest I also found that creating a whole world was unnecessary, so I'm settling for 7 steps to create a single kingdom, complete with main antagonists, hints of history from the population and economic data and a medium term goal for the party. Still haven't tested this short version, but the long one took 30 min in playtest, so I'm feeling confident with it.<br/><br/>I'd love to use conditions, but so far the system picks them up as "complications" and since my target audience here is more used to MMORPGs It looks that further complicating the system isn't needed; the players will do it by themselves if needed. <br/><br/>Right now I'm drawing the first page of the comic that will explain how to play <i>a la</i> Tenra Bansho, since the research I did on <a href="https://resourcefullrpg.wordpress.com/2013/07/31/techniques/" rel="nofollow">Roleplaying Techniques</a> showed me that a huge part of the "How to play the game" isn't explained to the players and however simple these parts are, they aren't intuitive. Of course, all you need to learn them is <i>to see somebody else doing it</i> hence, comics are the best way to explain how to play. David_Berg also influenced me on this, his game Delve also uses a comic to explain the most important techniques used on the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/liblarva" title="liblarva"><img alt="liblarva" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/liblarva">liblarva</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445645/#Comment_445645" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-13T04:08:57+00:00" title="June 13, 2015  4:08AM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>What about Bonds as stunts?

It's not about limiting the freedom of choice to players but instead about putting them on the right way to create their own. <br/><br/>Specially if you can save the players from creating aspects that will force their character to just attack each other at some point, or that will remove them from the story once a simple goal is achieved. Whatever helps them generate good roleplaying should be there. <br/>The Stunts part does a better work at this than the previous one.<br/><br/>Also, would a person who hasn't played or readed any AW game will be able to make sense of the GM principles as they are now? I've got my doubts about "Paint in Bold Tones" but maybe that's just me.<br/><br/>When I reached the moves section, I realized there are no "player moves". I really like this, but perhaps it should be made clearer from the first part ("The Conversation") that moves are handled only by the GM and players don't need to worry about when and how they apply.<br/><br/>I hope you also get to add a glossary eventually. Otherwise great work! ^_^                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445736">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/liblarva" title="liblarva"><img alt="liblarva" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/liblarva">liblarva</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445736/#Comment_445736" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-21T17:18:00+00:00" title="June 21, 2015  5:18PM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 21, 2015 5:39PM by liblarva.">edited June 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Accelerated World wasn't quite as streamlined or quick &amp; dirty as I was hoping, so I've gone with an ultra-light or possibly even PocketMod style iteration of the Apocalypse World engine...<br/><br/>Infinite Worlds: <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13825925/Infinite%20Worlds.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13825925/Infinite Worlds.pdf</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445747/#Comment_445747" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-22T05:20:19+00:00" title="June 22, 2015  5:20AM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sweet! Let me give you my procedure for setting generation. It's meant to help players create a setting quickly before play. The longer version produced a whole setting in less than hafs an hour. This version is still untested. It's made for medieval fantasy mostly, but it may give you some ideas:<br/><br/>1-How many sentient races exist in your setting? Name them, but don't detail them further yet.<br/>2-Do gods exist in your world? Will they intervene in the story? If you decide that yes, now each player can create one God. <br/>-Decide what concept it embodies (fire, justice, war, death, deceit, etc.) and give the god a name.<br/>-Decide how And where it's worshiped (with sacrifices, prayers, festival, etc., in temples, battlefields, river, secret, etc) and wich race or group are their main followers.<br/>-Describe the blessings that are usually granted to their followers and the punishments given to those that incur his wrath.<br/>-Throw a dice to see how important it is. A high roll means it has many influential supporters; a low roll means that it's a god with few faithful who may even be persecuted. The GM will establish how this came to be with the help of other players. This may also help define the relationship between the gods (if they are family, friends, enemies, etc.) and with mortals.<br/><br/>3- Everyone roll a dice, higher roll get's to be the king (or queen, or any title they want) of the kingdom (or whatever befitting name of the place) the PCs will start the adveture on. You may create as many as you want, but for a session a single kingdom is more than enough. Name the king, kingdom and draw the borders using a whole sheet of paper.<br/>Then, starting from the right each player adds an important place on the map; like a forest, a lake, a river, a desert, a mountain or a chain of mountains, islands, volcanoes, cities, etc. Add what you like to the description of the place. The stranger, more dangerous and / or interesting, the better!<br/><br/>4-Technology: When is again the turn of the king, roll the dice to define the technological level of the kingdom. By default, 1 is early Iron Age and 6 is the Italian Renaissance or the Industrial Revolution; the advance may also be in terms of magic. Again, starting with the player on the right each one will point one side-effect of the technological level of the kingdom. If there is powder, what they do now to protect against weapons created with this development? If it is a society of the Iron Age, what superstitions does people have? Is there still savage tribes in the kingdom? How wild are? Or are they perhaps much more advanced than your culture?. If you wish, you can also play with more advanced technology.<br/><br/>5- Economy: When the turn of the king comes again, name the main economic activity of the kingdom and roll the dice to see how well it goes. Take note of this result and roll the dice again to determine the population. The number rolled now will be the amount of zeros the population's numer will have. Put the previously rolled number to the left of these zeroes: that's the current population of the kingdom. For example, if the first roll was a 5, it means that the kingdom is doing pretty well. If the second roll was a 3, it means that the current population is 300,000 (3 followed by 5 zeroes)<br/>What if roll a double one? Well yes, then there are 10 people because the region has prbably been destryed! Decide how it all happened; possibly the adventure now will be to find survivors and get out of the place!.<br/><br/>6-Dangers and hopes: Now every player is an inhabitant of the kingdom. Answer together:<br/>What are you most afraid of? It can be a monster, an invasion of a neighboring kingdom, religion, technology or magic out of control, a revolt, a tyrant, bandits, pirates, etc. According to the state of the kingdom decide whether the threat has already happened or is yet to come.<br/>What gives you hope? It may be your ruler, a heroine or hero, a protector spirit, a prophecy, an escape plan, you can even list your characters as hopes!<br/><br/>7-The beginning of Adventure. Throw two dice on the map. Choose one, that is where the adventure begins. The other is the place where yo will need to go. Why and how? To explain this use the numbers you rolled. These numbers indicate how dangerous is the place right now. You may be fleeing the place because it has become too dangerous, to a safer area. Or you may go on mission to pacify another place or are venturing there because there is a hidden treasure. If both results are low, it may mean that they will be  escorting someone and the main danger is on the way. If both dice are high it may mean that they are escaping a danger to venture into another equally dangerous place and rescue someone, infiltrate a fortress to attack the villain or retrieve an object. It may be that the entire region is dangerous and that the only way out is where it's even more dangerous. Does the dice rolled into the sea? it may be an island, a boat ... or how about a flying boat or a floating island? Let your imagination guide you!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb" title="hamnacb"><img alt="hamnacb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">hamnacb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445749/#Comment_445749" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-22T08:15:58+00:00" title="June 22, 2015  8:15AM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I never get to play Fate as it is mostly because I didn't found enough reference on how to phrase and how not to phrase an Aspect.

Any concept at least needs to have one related skill.<br/><br/>Besides those, players get for free the core skills I believe are needed for any game: Athletics, Stealth, Perception, Persuasion, Intimidation and Deception. Mostly I did it because new players often oversee these as they get enthusiast about having all kind of special powers to flesh their characters. So far it works wonders for the players, I actually didn't needed to give them the list of skills and stuff I had prepared, but I've learned to appreciate these lists as sources of inspiration for both players and the GM.<br/><br/>I still need to playtest it a bit, but I was hoping my procedure for setting generation may help players develope the connections between their characters and the setting, which is really important for keeping them motivated and focused.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/liblarva" title="liblarva"><img alt="liblarva" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/liblarva">liblarva</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445781/#Comment_445781" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-23T21:17:56+00:00" title="June 23, 2015  9:17PM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 23, 2015 9:18PM by liblarva.">edited June 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Have you ever thought about the <a href="http://www.prime-junta.net/numenera/" rel="nofollow">Numenera-ish way</a> ([adjective] [noun] who [verb]s)?<br/>It's not really my cup of tea but I can see why so many of my players found it easy to grasp.<br/></blockquote>\nThat could certainly work. Similar to the fill-in-the-blanks style of stunts presented in Fate Core/Accelerated. Maybe just for the high concept though.
