The sad Kickstarters that don't go anywhere are by lone geniuses who nobody knows, and then nobody notices that they even did something when they try it. This is of course true for all publishing, but Kickstarter makes this especially tricky in that you're trying to build up a quick push of support over at most a few months - this isn't going to happen if you don't "cheat" by preparing your audience in advance. In traditional publishing you can first print your stuff, then sit on it a few months, go insane out of frustration, go to the Forge, learn about guerrilla marketing, and <i>then</i> start selling that print run you still have. With Kickstarter you'll often only find out how far your social cred really carries and how much interest there is in a specific sort of product when you actually try to do it. And when you do, it's already too late to build up the premarketing: you should have done that before, even if it takes several years to become a well-known name among a particular customer segment when using only net presence as your marketing tool.<br/><br/>The above specifically claims that product quality or price is not a strong determinant in Kickstarter success. Of course there's some effect, but it's second-hand: for your too-high-price to even matter the guy needs to <i>first</i> be invested enough to know about and consider buying your product. Similarly, your product being bad only matters if <i>first</i> the guy cared enough to try it or read reviews by people who did. In both cases the first bottleneck is whether your potential customer even knows that your stuff exists; the second bottleneck is whether they have any reason to look into it in detail, or even consider participating. If you feel that these two bottlenecks are not your problem, then you're clearly not a small-time operator. My observation of the grassroots culture industry indicates that either Kickstarter is a popularity game, or it's just dumb luck that determines who succeeds and who doesn't. Most of the time the successfull Kickstarter is preceded by remarkably vivacious online presence and successful community-building, though, which makes me think that at least some of the time it's about more than just luck.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362702/#Comment_362702" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-26T11:32:20+00:00" title="February 26, 2012 11:32AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jamie, I didn't buy into That's Drama because the design looked like Apples to Apples, which to me, was a bit off-putting.

I'm B.J. West, the creator of the Story Forge deck. A friend of mine just gave me a list of other story-creating decks, many of which I'd never heard of, and in the course of checking them out, found the "That's Drama" deck and this thread. I hope it's OK if I join the party!<br/>\n<br/>\nJamie, from what I can see from your blog, our card systems are *very* different, though they serve the same audience. As Orklord observed, my cards are loosely tarot influenced, leading to a fairly "squishy" creative process. Nothing is discretely defined, everything is designed to create impressions rather than definitions, and let your brain fill in the gaps. You cards use more crisply defined elements, more akin to the 1936  "Deal-A-Plot" deck. Both approaches are valid, and different writers will be drawn to different tools. I could easily see a writer using *both* of our decks, depending on what kind of story they were working on.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for why the response to my deck has been so good, it's purely a question of how much time and effort I have burned in communicating what my deck does and why writers should buy it. I've been developing Story Forge going on 12 years now, playtesting, test marketing, refining, and talking up my cards to anyone who would stand still long enough to hear me out. I've printed test runs of the deck and done demos at science-fiction conventions, submitted the deck to every writer I could find and solicited feedback from them, and taken part in conversations on hundreds of forums like this one. I have a substantial website with videos of the cards in use, so people can see exactly how they work, and where they can buy them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn comparison, in the most recent post I can find on your blog you say "So I'm still working on it; no idea when I'll have a new version ready." It's not exactly a call to action!<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried finding a traditional publisher for Story Forge first, and after a pile of rejection slips, almost gave up on the project entirely. Kickstarter was my last push, and I made it my full time job for more than two months before the fundraising ended. Now the cards are in production and should be available for general sale in late July.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour cards look pretty cool. I would buy a deck right this minute if I could. You shouldn't give up on them. Kickstarter is a good way to go to raise the funds for self-publishing, but it would be up to you to flog the entire internet to generate the interest. The old adage about "if you build a better mousetrap, the world will beat a path to your door" is utter rubbish. It's up to you to let the world know you have a better mousetrap, and convince them that it is indeed better. The only thing you lose if it doesn't work is time.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW: Graham, UserClone is right. The art you saw on the Kickstarter page was a series of posters I was offering as an incentive for higher pledges. The cards themselves are a fairly simple system of text and graphics.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor whatever it's worth,<br/>\nBeej<br/>\nhttp://www.StoryForgeCards.com                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
