I've had some of the same experiences as others in that thread, trying to poke friends with the pointy stick of System Matters and whatnot, only to have them stick steadfastly to what they know, no matter what. So, I'm genuinely curious - what makes d20 a great system? Aside from "it's what we already know", why would someone choose to play a d20 game over something more focused, or some other "generic" RPG system?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312496/#Comment_312496" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-14T12:43:52+00:00" title="February 14, 2011 12:43PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            STAVROPOULOS, I SUMMON THEE!

(Especially when you sneak attack, but then you're risking your squishy rogue.) <br/>"Do I move to that advantageous position, exposing myself to the opportunity attack?" - a few times that's been the play of the night, someone risking the AOO to help a friend and it paying off.<br/>Much like in the Avengers every superhero gets an issue to shine, some nights your character will be the VIP.<br/>You usually don't get killed - you usually get knocked unconscious.  It's a lot more forgiving than it seems.<br/>Orthogonal character classes.  Striker, tank, healer, support+grenades always good.<br/>A good compromise with the time-slicing - you usually get to do one meaty thing on your turn, unlike games that split it up more finely ("I begin casting my spell...")<br/>And me, I prefer the grid to hex-maps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312511/#Comment_312511" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-14T13:25:37+00:00" title="February 14, 2011  1:25PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's none of that tell-me-about-your-mother or expose-your-deep-anxiety shit, like in indie games.

They are nice and simple and easy to understand. And like I said in the other thread, some of the d20 games I like. The current version of Mutants &amp; Masterminds/DC Adventures is pretty damn good. Kinda brings narrative games and d20 rules-heavy games to the mediation table for peace-talks.<br/><br/>Certain versions of d20 games, ones that are sorta out in left field, I think are better and more flexible than the version originally pushed by WOTC. DungeonSlayers, for example, is a good, solid d20 game, needing no other dice (I mean, I don't know why D&amp;D etc are "d20" games when they require the whole gamut of other dice), and keeps some of the tactical feel without being laden with extra rules, details you have to keep track of, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312522/#Comment_312522" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-14T14:46:16+00:00" title="February 14, 2011  2:46PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            + 1 on "d20" not really telling you much.<br/><br/>True20, Mutants and Masterminds, A Game of Thrones, Star Wars Saga?

This faded a bit as d20 really got going, but it has always been near the head of the pack. (Full color art for every monster, for example.) I think Pathfinder vaulted back in front of the pack in this regard.<br/><br/>2) The structure of the game elements is quite good at driving a revenue stream with steady product, and this has an ancillary benefit: the line seems "fresh" for longer. That is, if you are into the game, it is tough to get sick of it when new shiny comes out every couple of months.<br/><br/>3) The game clearly scratches a "min/maxing" itch among a huge percentage of its rabid followers. Go to any forum and witness an endless litany of "killer builds", how to combine various bits for maximum effectiveness and so on. Among casual players of the d20 line, the percentage who care about this is a lot smaller, but it seems pretty clear that a large portion of the die-hard players become so because it appeals to this "optimizing gene" (or whatever it is).<br/><br/>4) As a "toolkit" it does a <i>really</i> good job of adapting to pretty much any combination of components. That is, it is easy to pick and choose from the wide body of classes, feats and so on and have the game still pretty much work within whatever subset you might choose. Want to ditch the every core class and define some others? No problem. Arcana Evolved games, for example, are still recognizably "d20", in spite of replacing almost everything.<br/><br/>5) The "level vs. CR" system does a pretty good job of guiding everyone, especially gamemasters, as to how hard a given scene will be. Which matters a lot, because...<br/><br/>6) The game supports a fairly broad "power curve" in a manageable way. Consequently, it supports long term play in ways that everyone can intuitively understand after a few sessions.<br/><br/>7) Relative to the versions of the game it replaced, it does an OK job of unifying onto a "core mechanic" that anyone can understand in about 30 seconds. Roll a d20, add some standard stuff, compare to difficulty. (Granted, comparing this to AD&amp;D, with its THAC0 and some rolls favoring high numbers and some favoring low, is faint praise.)<br/><br/>8) Occasionally does weird, questionable, things for the right reasons. One example of this are the "types" of bonuses, and how they do or, more often, don't, stack (e.g. "dodge bonus", "enhancement bonus", etc.). All of that stuff is fairly wacky and cumbersome, but it does actually prevent the math of the game from falling apart in a lot of ways. At the same time, it allows variation of roles and everyone to still be able to do stuff, without turning everyone into ultra-buffed godlings (well, at least not right away).<br/><br/>9) The alignment system opens up some interesting notions. (Bear with me here.) The idea that not only does every character in the game have a definitive moral stance, but that you can <i>actually use magic to detect what that code is</i> colors the game more deeply than you might think. If you ask a bunch of people "what makes this game great", pretty much no one will yell out "the alignment system", but I think it is a big part of it. I'm not entirely sure how, though.<br/><br/>10) Even though many stories speak to the contrary, as written the game does a decent job of being "fair". That is, the type of player that cares about "fairness" is typically satisfied by the written rules. More to the point, the game provides a reasonable blueprint for "fairness" that still works even for situations not covered in the rules. The rules create a certain "expectation of reasonableness", and that expectation is fairly "standard" among all players. Even when everything goes to hell and players and DM are screaming at each other, a "detached observer" that knows nothing about the particular game can usually figure out what side of the argument is "correct" based on the rules.<br/><br/>11) The d20 itself.

I keep regretting that d20 was a dead-end in the evolution of Call of Cthulhu rules text, because it had excellent GM advice, especially compared to the weak sauce offered up by BRP. Seriously, all you have to do to fix the game for even moderately long-term play is to eliminate HP gains per level (did they actually playtest that?) and toss out the pointless combat feats, and it works very well. Faster character creation than BRP or even Trail, plus the ability to leverage existing system familiarity for a large player base, plus easy to teach?

You want to roll high.  That's it.  Anything else (Feats, skills, powers, attributes) are things that can be added or left out for particular games.  They, to my mind, aren't really d20.  If you take the d20 mechanic and drop it on GURPS instead of the 3d6 it'd be a d20 game. <br/><br/>The comment about GURPS and HERO having unwieldably many options compared to d20 is somewhat true, but I think that more has to do with dropping the whole set of core books on the player with a thump than handing them D&amp;D Essentials Heros of the Fallen Lands and telling them to select a character from there.  With GM preparation the "you get Improved Swinging from Chandeliers, for free" is absolutely possible in HERO or GURPS with the use of templates.  The same feeling of being overwhelmend is entirely possible if you take the whole line of 3e books and hand them to a player (of 4e for that matter).<br/><br/>Easily understood, easily modified, tweaked or hacked are all good points for the base d20 mechanic.  I don't take the extra stuff like classes or stats to be uniquely d20 since you can find those design types in other systems that don't use d20 mechanic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy" title="DeBracy"><img alt="DeBracy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nTIWP6SSS5BV3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy">DeBracy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312689/#Comment_312689" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-15T12:42:20+00:00" title="February 15, 2011 12:42PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 15, 2011 1:46PM by DeBracy.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: masqueradeball</cite>Whatever the latest edition of Spycraft is and Wheel of Time.</blockquote>\nWheel of Time would be one of my picks as well, for the other I'd go with Conan or Iron Heroes.<br/><br/>Edit: If something more modern and light-weight (as in a smaller physical product mainly) is desireable, the True20 Pocket Player's Guide would be a terrific choice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312697">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312697/#Comment_312697" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-15T13:33:08+00:00" title="February 15, 2011  1:33PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll second Iron Heroes.<br/><br/>I mean, it super combat oriented but it's up front about it.

If you said that and tried to play many D20 forms that way, you'd probably realize that the systems are more equivalently complex than you expected.<br/><br/>Better than nearly any game I know, D20 elegantly smooths a players entry into a really rich mechanical experience down the line. The closest analog I can think of is the original edition of Squad Leader, where you had a series of scenarios that built on complexity and rules to introduce you to the game in layers, and did so alarmingly successfully (where each level felt like a satisfying experience, not like "write hello world" and then "here, write a device driver").<br/><br/>To me, this slow introduction of players to the game over a long period of time by layering options onto characters is one of my two favourite features. The other is most specifically realized in 4e.<br/><br/>More than just about any game I know, as a Referee, I feel like I can just put together a good encounter for my players that's balanced, interesting, and reasonably guaranteed to produce a fun outcome, by letting the game itself handle all the math balancing. 4e's a game that seems purpose built around "make it easy for GMs to do their jobs", and it works quite successfully. (Oddly enough, I'd put HERO and HeroQuest, especially 2nd edition, in that category as well, but I think 4e outshines both in this single aspect of play.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312703/#Comment_312703" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-15T13:41:52+00:00" title="February 15, 2011  1:41PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: nemomeme</cite>My recommendation would be to start with d20 Modern...</blockquote> d20 Call of Cthulhu is basically a streamlined d20 Modern, cleaned up by supporting just the one kind of setting, rather than trying to be a generic system.

It's a fairly widespread system. Lots of folks don't love it, but they're willing to play it. Get people together and say, "I want to run sci-fi game". and you'll have all sorts of questions and discussion. Get folks together and say, "I want to run a Star Wars game" and things are much more focused. You say "d20" and there's a whole chunk of stuff that snaps into focus. Sure, there's variations on the d20 rules, but that's like saying "clone wars" or... I dunno, other eras of Star Wars. Some folks know 'em and some don't, but it's a common starting point.<br/><br/>2. Lots of customisation already done for you. Plenty of different rule hacks of diffeerent sorts done. Assembling your frankenstein might take some work, but it's possible. Chances are, ifyou wanna run something, someone's either already done a chunk/entire thing for you, or there's something you can reskin and tweak.<br/><br/>3. Lots of customisation you can do. Don't like screwing with XP? Fine, all characters level after 13 encounters. Want a game of a particular power level? Fine, start characters at whatever level you need, you can even lock the game at that level and give some other perk instead of levels; E6 is an example of on approach to this implementation.<br/><br/>4. Explicit information on opposition. Characters are supposed to level after 13.33 encounters. There's instructions on how many encounters of what sort there should be and a way of rating the opposition. Sure, the CR system isn't perfect, but a)it's more than most games seem to come with and b) there's a fix for the CR system that helps increase the consistency of it.<br/><br/>5. It's a "my first game design" for wannabes; either rule hackers or full on "designers". You can start out small and simple, tweaking a rule here or there, you can be more ambitious, playing around with class design, you can go all out and start screwing with some of the underpinning math. And there 's an active enough community, that you can be taken to task for lazy design, or simply uninformed design. You'll be told if it's been tried and what the effects were; sure, not all the feedback is reliable/stellar, but you'd have to deal with that anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Calithena" title="Calithena"><img alt="Calithena" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Calithena">Calithena</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312806/#Comment_312806" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-16T05:54:40+00:00" title="February 16, 2011  5:54AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't consider any version of D&amp;D; except 3.0/3.5 'd20', FWIW.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also agree with posters who say it's not really a system.

One interesting side effect of this: often, characters gaining more and more advanced options often makes the game <i>faster</i>, because it eliminates rules rather than adding them.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312973/#Comment_312973" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-16T17:17:37+00:00" title="February 16, 2011  5:17PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just picked up the 4e essentials compendium to plunder for Dungeon World and haven't had a d20 ruleset since AD&amp;D or the original runequest.

Even people who like d20 (raises hand) come to realize that just shoving the core mechanics into some new book with some new classes isn't enough to really float a system, and the popularity of such spin off d20 games tend to be fleeting unless the authors really bring something to the game and know how to make it work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313278/#Comment_313278" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-18T16:51:44+00:00" title="February 18, 2011  4:51PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pass/fail is easily understood, and d20 + modifier vs TN is also easily understood. Hit points are also easily understood. So the foundations of the system are very simple and straight forward, particularly compared to some indie games. This means you can just get started playing without actually understanding the whole system. That makes it good.<br/><br/>Next, we've got all the rules for specific situations, and optional rules, such as attacks of opportunity, which end up being divisive. Those who enjoy rules mastery think it's great, so they have something that's simple to start with and keeps their interest with more complexity. Other people go the other way and decide that it's too complex and therefore not fun, particularly when you have other players with much more system mastery.<br/><br/>So to really make it simple, the reason that people who hate d20 hate it, is what makes it a great system - just, like anything except oxygen and water, it's not for everyone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
