Does anyone have any experience with running DW for only two PCs? Any advice or anything I should be aware of? I'm especially wondering how well Bonds work with only two heroes.<br/>Thanks in advance!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401881/#Comment_401881" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-27T20:37:14+00:00" title="December 27, 2012  8:37PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 27, 2012 8:37PM by Felan.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've done it a bunch of times, and it's super fun. Very much lends itself to Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser style swashbuckling adventuring partners. In the current/final version of the rules, Bonds are pretty much fully compatible with two-player games - there just won't be a fast turnover of bonds (probably every few sessions, rather than every session). If you want more bond-based XP opportunities, you could incorporate NPC bonds as well. But yeah, the game sings even with just a pair if players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Terwox" title="Terwox"><img alt="Terwox" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/482/nSPMQ33PX1PEF.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Terwox">Terwox</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401990/#Comment_401990" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-28T19:57:19+00:00" title="December 28, 2012  7:57PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran a 2-player DW game on Christmas, and we used one bond written between the characters, and one bond written between each character and an NPC.  Worked pretty well, I can't say it ran much differently than playing with one to five players, besides allowing/asking for NPC bonds.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402027">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JLHBurnett" title="JLHBurnett"><img alt="JLHBurnett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/722/nB1X4KGH4YFEW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JLHBurnett">JLHBurnett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402027/#Comment_402027" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-29T02:23:49+00:00" title="December 29, 2012  2:23AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Groovy. This is pretty much what I was hoping to hear. I'm a huge fan of any kind of Fafhrd and Mouser kind of vibe.  I hadn't actually considered NPC bonds, but I might just give them a shot.<br/>Of course, If the game goes off (still haven't heard back from one player) I'll be sure to give a good AP report.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
