Every stage was planned: our choices were irrelevant, because the GM made them fit his adventure. Sometimes, he was blatant, blocking our ideas: "You can't go south. There's a huge cliff.". Sometimes, he tricked us, making it seem like our decisions mattered, even though they didn't: "All right, you go south. You come to a big castle."<br/><br/>We used the rules we liked and ignored the ones we didn't. Often, we'd fudge die rolls: "Let's say you pick the lock". Sometimes, we'd fudge them less obviously: "But then you notice another way in". We'd ignore the character sheets, which would often stay in the drawer.<br/><br/>At the time, it seemed like fun. Looking back, though, it probably wasn't. I'd sit in my room, for hours, drawing dungeons. I'd buy all the latest books. But I wasn't really enjoying myself.</i><br/><br/>Having read stories like this, many times, I'm getting suspicious. I'm not sure they're entirely true. They're not false, either, but I think we're kidding ourselves, just a little.<br/><br/>Here's what I think happens. We read these stories on forums. Then we look back at their own experience and think: yes, we did fudge die rolls. Yes, we ignored rules. And, gradually, we start to see our experiences a little differently.<br/><br/>Then there's a period of social validation. It's socially acceptable to tell such anecdotes: if I say "Dungeons and Dragons sucks", lots of people agree. It validates our identity a little: we're indie gamers, dammit, and we've moved on! There's a political sense, too. Indie games do things differently from Dungeons and Dragons, so it's useful to point out how the old way was bad.<br/><br/>It's not entirely false. There's definitely elements of truth in these stories. But it's carefully constructed and selective. I think it's a myth: not false, not real, but something subtly in between.<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205585/#Comment_205585" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-06T07:20:11+00:00" title="May  6, 2009  7:20AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe,  but I think you could substitute D&amp;D with a lot of other things you and your friends did twenty years ago and that would still be true.

That doesn't mean the rules as written sucked or that we weren't having a good deal of fun. For me personally, I needed a mix of dramatic tension, cinematic framing, and heroism that D&amp;D; just didn't promote by any means except color. It's that spirit in the color, in the images, flavor text, and even play examples that guided my DMing. Which in turn shaped the play at the table.<br/>\n<br/>\nD&amp;D; just wasn't the tool for what I needed.

It's easy to look back at it now and wince at all the stuff that, decades later, seems awful to me, and extra-double-easy to figure out that I can't have fun playing that game today, but none of that changes the fun I had when I was 16 making crude jokes with my buddies, geeking out over monster stats, and endlessly tinkering with house rules in our constant effort to make AD&amp;D2e better fit what we wanted it to do.  Like a lot of high school, I'm grateful for the fun I had when I was there, and I'm grateful that I never have to go back.<br/><br/><br/>Although in a way, I did go back a little bit...when 3rd edition came out, my current gaming group played us a good old-fashioned kick-in-the-door-and-kill-the-orcs-style campaign, low on seriousness and high on action.  It was hilarious and fun and essentially a deliberate mixture of the kinds of games we play today with all the best nostalgic highlights of the games we played back then.<br/><br/>Only, you know, with rules that didn't suck.  Because man, even back in high school I knew that AD&amp;D2e was a terrible, terrible system.  <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_205762">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205762/#Comment_205762" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-06T15:15:25+00:00" title="May  6, 2009  3:15PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I also have to give proper respect to the major, major role that certain recreational substances played in my early D&amp;D career.

You twisted my arm.<br/><br/>The thing is, when I think back about my D&amp;D experiences, I can't trust my memory. I remember a lot of frustration and some arguments. I also remember that I could not get enough of it. I was addicted. I spent countless "lonely fun" hours on D&amp;D stuff, and it was definitely fun and not something I would give up.<br/><br/>When it came time to play, there were some brilliant moments, but they were rarer than they ought to have been. I always wanted my games (and they were "my games," with all the stupid high school social dynamics of me being the DM-social leader and them being my player flock) to be more than what they were. I wanted grand and epic stories. I wanted character development, and I don't mean leveling up. I wanted the players to care about the same stuff I cared about, as much as I cared about it -- but they did not.<br/><br/>I harassed my players. I was awful. I created questionnaires to determine their preferences and find out what was good or bad about each session. They rolled their eyes a lot. I offered XP for their involvement in writing stuff about their characters beyond filling in the boxes on the character sheet. To this day, I still create <a href="http://tinyurl.com/metrocalypse" rel="nofollow">Player's Guides</a> and hope the players read them carefully; I am disappointed when they do not.<br/><br/>When I went to GenCon for the first time in 1989, two years out of high school, I returned to that same gaming group (we met much less regularly now that I was away at college) with new ideas about what my games should be. I drifted the rules further and further with house rule additions. The players didn't drift with me. I grew increasingly dissatisfied. I did have some awesome games at college but they were short-lived. I moved away for work and didn't find the magic again until I discovered the indie game scene.<br/><br/>Those feelings aren't constructed. I'm not saying every moment was miserable. Overall, these games were fun, but a feeling of longing always accompanied them: "This is fun, but it is missing something substantial."

D&amp;D continued to be awesome for a good 15 years as I DMed my group of friends through endless campaigns all the way up and into college.  Sure there were disagreements at the table but in no larger a respective portion than there were in any of the other activities we enjoyed.

"there were the times", "good times", "Ah, the games we played at the time...". And I am not talking only about this thread: when I still didn't know that the Forge existed, I was convinced that the best gaming experience was in the past, never to be lived again, and it was the very first session I played (that was almost ruleless because the GM was only a player in another GM campaign and didn't know the rules).

May be true but I'm not sure.  I think I can add more beneficial stuff to this thread now.  Maybe it is like you say Moreno that for the traditional gamer the best times are in the past but I tend to go with Judd on this one.  Its obvious that I was waxing very nostalgic in my post but I think most likely it has to do with a lot of environmental factors more than it did the game we were playing.  In "those days" we played most Friday nights until the wee hours of the morning and then couldn't friggin' even wait to get started again Saturday!!  Hell yeah!  It wasn't a problem getting everyone together, and we didn't have to worry about unemployment, or whether our parents were sick, or when the economy was going to turn around.  None of that crap.  We just had regular gaming, every weekend, where we got together and bullshitted out some wacky adventure together.<br/><br/>Now, I probably haven't gamed in almost two years.  Its a nightmare to get everyone together, never mind getting a regular groove going.  So in that sense, those days of gaming are gone.  And they were awesome.<br/><br/>More directly to this thread, I can say that when I first came to rpg.net a couple years ago I was burning out on D&amp;D.  None of my friends were, but I was.  I honest to God didn't even know there WERE any other RPGs at that time.  And I'd played D&amp;D for nearly 25 years at that point!  Then I came to rpg.net and got my mind blown.  I eventually made my way to the forge.  At that point I think I may have went through a short phase where I thought, "Wow, here's a bunch of other people that are burnt out and they're helping me understand why D&amp;D sucks."  Maybe I did catch that bug for a bit.  But it didn't take me long to realize that I was out of place at the forge, because the folks there (I know you guys are here too and I mean no offense whatsoever) took they're gaming WAY more seriously than I did.  The big tip off was all the discussion on Fantasy Heartbreakers.  I remember thinking, "Hell, what a shame, that's EXACTLY what I'm looking for....a different style of D&amp;D."<br/><br/>Anyway, all that to say to the original poster that yeah, I think I sort of had that happen initially.  I new D&amp;D wasn't working for me at that point for whatever reason, and it was easy to think I was on board with all of those awesome intellectuals who had figured out a way to game around D&amp;D and it proved why D&amp;D didn't work.  It never really made me rewrite my memories of D&amp;D though, I never came to the conclusion that my old gaming days really sucked and that I had just been confused the whole time.  Nothing like that.  Then and now, there is no doubt that we were having a blast.  But we also never really had any of the social posturing, authority power trips, etc. that you hear so much about in association with "the old days" and traditional gaming.  I don't know man, we just gamed... A LOT...and it was great.  The good sessions were great and the bad ones were still a hell of a lot fun and laughter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206063">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206063/#Comment_206063" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T11:11:27+00:00" title="May  7, 2009 11:11AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 7, 2009 11:15AM by Joe Murphy.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite><br/><br/>It wasn't terrible but it just wasn't as consistently as good.

Everything that we disliked about AD&amp;D2e was a subject for geeky debate and analysis, as we fiddled around to find some house rule that we liked better.  Then we'd test out those new systems, and keep tinkering.  The joy of formulating and putting a house rule into practice was a definite draw for us.  We'd critique new spells, kits, and rules and if we saw what we considered a flaw, we'd attempt to fix it.<br/><br/>As far as the play experience of those games goes, we didn't analyze that nearly as much, maybe for obvious reasons (teenaged boys are definitely not your go-to guys for self-awareness and social aptitude).  That came later, and turns out to be the thing that makes playing more fun for me today (and why going back to playing like we did in high school would be so unsatisfying to me now).  Like others have said, when we had fun, we had a lot of fun.  But when we didn't have fun, we accepted the not-fun as something unavoidable and immune to the same tinkering spirit that informed our rules analysis.

In fact, we still run it and play it and write stuff for it.<br/><br/>I don't need D&amp;D to be flawed. For decades, I needed it not to be flawed. Like I said above, for the most part, I had fun, but I always wanted something more out of the experience and it left me feeling hollow. It still does, and that's why I'm still looking for the game that makes me feel like I'm playing D&amp;D but without all the stuff that leaves me feeling that way (i.e., a Fantasy Heartbreaker).<br/><br/>Also, it's bad form to tell other people they're not remembering what they say they're remembering. If you want to say you're doing it, that's fine, but leave me out of it. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/><i>Edited for grammar.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MJ%20Harnish" title="MJ Harnish"><img alt="MJ Harnish" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MJ%20Harnish">MJ Harnish</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206278/#Comment_206278" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-08T09:28:38+00:00" title="May  8, 2009  9:28AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Vernon R</cite>I had fun hanging out with friends and taking imaginary characters through dangerous situations.

I have a very hard time separating the camaraderie and friendship I shared back then from the fun of the game. I know we didn't play the rules exactly as written and that we didn't have awesome adventures all of the time, but we always had fun. We couldn't get enough of it. While I think my games nowadays are 100% better in terms of structure and story development, I have a hard time recapturing the sheer joy of play that I had back then....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206282">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206282/#Comment_206282" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-08T09:33:07+00:00" title="May  8, 2009  9:33AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Did you first play D&amp;D when you were 12 or when you were 20? 30?<br/><br/>Did you get into it in the 70s or the 80s or the 90s?<br/><br/>I'll bet Graham's mythic tale is much truer for the 30somethings who learned to play in the 90s than it is for the teens who learned to play in the late 70s-early 80s.<br/><br/>The thing I called "playing D&amp;D" was awesome fun in 6th grade, 1980.
