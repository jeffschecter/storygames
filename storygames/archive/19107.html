New publishing technologies will make it just as easy to stage a successful release in other formats.</blockquote>\nHow did this happen in the first place? When I was toting around the early drafts of SFBK I mentioned at one point that it was going to be A5, to which someone replied 'Don't you mean 6X9?' or 'Oh no, it's got to be 6x9', or some such. Now, the only reason I said A5 was because I'd seen a lot of small books floating around and figured that was indeed the industry standard, but assumed the size was A5, not having previously heard of 6x9. The one big advantage with industry standard book sizes IMO is that they can be easily fitted onto one's bookshelves, and transported in bags and boxes to and from cons etc., but of course that's advantageous to the consumer not the producer, so it's a very consumerist precept. <br/><br/>So what do y'all think about this, whether about having industry standards at all, or your preferences for certain formats as producers? And are certain formats better in some way for some games, or types of games? Forex, I don't think smaller sizes do justice to rich, full-colour illos, which may be the reason  that trad games tend to be A4. And why did indie games become 6x9? Was it a way of distancing them from the tradosauruses, or simply because they had less text, and less content in general, and so would have looked rather thin in A4 format?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SGTillings" title="SGTillings"><img alt="SGTillings" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SGTillings">SGTillings</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426458/#Comment_426458" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-02T06:40:45+00:00" title="January  2, 2014  6:40AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would say that yes it is a way of distinction from Trad books but story games and their kin also lend themselves better to smaller formats due to a more minimal selection of rules (mostly). A4 is brilliant for trad because they can fit more on a page and thus the page count doesn't go astronomically high but story games don't need to do this. It's probably down to ease as well, carrying round a bag full of trad games is a herculean task and you are more likely to have to just pick one system but the smaller books are easier to carry and you can have lots from different games. Aesthetically too it just looks nicer to me and they don't take up the majority of my playspace if I am facilitating.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426460/#Comment_426460" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-02T07:07:58+00:00" title="January  2, 2014  7:07AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 2, 2014 7:10AM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>but of course that's advantageous to the consumer not the producer, so it's a very consumerist precept.</blockquote>\nHeh, I love how looking after the interests of the common man is "consumerist" here...\n<blockquote>So what do y'all think about this, whether about having industry standards at all, or your preferences for certain formats as producers?

This is because they are not reference books, but rather reading books. These two categories of "reference" and "reading" books explain most of this phenomenon.<br/><br/>Some rpg books are reference books, for which the quarto is generally an appropriate size: if your game has complex procedures or many of them, so that people need to reference the text in play, then a big format is appropriate from an usability viewpoint: the large page size makes it easier to make individual spreads visually distinctive, to fit entire topics on single spreads, and to simply have less pages to flip through while looking for something. The book will also stay open easier, and be easier to handle while referencing. Visuals can also be more complex on a larger page.<br/><br/>On the other hand, some rpg books are reading books, which the octavo or even smaller is usually best: you're supposed to read it all the way through, learn it, and then mostly not do anything with the book during play except have it around as a totemic symbol that reminds us what we're playing right now. For such a book it is very appropriate to be in a much smaller format: it can be held in hands while reading instead of laying the book on a table, for instance. Typographical usability is much better, it's easier to design comfortably readable pages when the page dimensions are roughly appropriate for a single-column layout. It's also easier to carry around, and it is in general more convenient a size when you don't need a greater page area for anything.<br/><br/>(There are other "types" of books, too, such as the "coffee table book", which is big mostly so it can have big pictures. I do not think that this is the best motivation, or the actual real motivation behind the size of your traditional rpg book; the reference tome requirements are a much more pressing thing, and the text-intensive nature of rpg books makes them sucky coffee table books. A proper book for such decorative purposes has short snippets of text, at most 30% or so of the page area.)<br/><br/>If you'll look at the choices people in the rpg industry make for their rpg books, you'll find that the traditional publisher will often choose the quarto for simple marketing reasons, with little thought: it's the standard, it grabs attention on the game store shelf, it is what the commercial system expects. However, if you look at the choices made by indies, you may perhaps perceive the underlying usability logic: many times the indie game does not really need to be in a reference size, and thus the book designer opts for more compact, more appropriate dimensions, regardless of flouting the logic of traditional formats. Even more significantly, sometimes the indie chooses to go for the traditional size; there are some cases where this was simply a mistake (<i>Space Rat</i> is an excellent example of a book that should have been small), while in other cases the nature of the game makes the reference size the best choice. And of course, you can be in octavo when you should be in quarto: the <i>Burning Wheel</i> games are an excellent example, where the small page dimensions and tight binding make the constant referencing in e.g. chargen more bothersome than would strictly be necessary.<br/><br/>(Because this is the Internet, I'll remind the dear reader that the above is just a quick explanatory model that is not intended to cover each and every case of personal preference and design concern. I'm sure that if you chose the "wrong" format for your book, you had good reasons; specifically, "because I wanted to" is a very good reason when doing something for yourself.)<br/><br/>One more special case: Jim Raggi tells me that he actively wants his D&amp;D adventure modules to be in octavo size (A5 to be specific, because he's printing here in Finland) because it's easier to handle behind the GM screen, in the specific use case of running a dungeon out of a book. I believe him, my own experience tells me that it's a very nice format for a small adventure module to have. This has to do with the nature of reference in dungeon adventures: for the most part you move forward in the text and stay long periods of time in a single area that is small enough to fit on one spread even in an octavo-sized book, so the small size does not in fact cause any more flipping of pages back and forth than a larger size would. Jim's book design does pay for the size factor when e.g. random tables are dense (you can see how we struggle with making the layouts work there), but for the dungeon stuff the size is quite appropriate.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, I think that this is a pretty simple book design issue. Of course issues like flouting or affirming expectations go into it as well, but for the most part it should not be forgotten that there are genuine reasons for books in this civilization to come in various shapes and sizes. For practical purposes I might give a good rule of thumb here: always make your book small, unless you have a specific reason to go big. The smaller book simply has many general advantages that should only be ignored if you have a big, concrete reason justifying a bigger and clumsier book.<br/><br/>Regarding standard formats, I strongly prefer books to come in a series of discrete standard sizes. This goes as both a retailer and an end-user. It's just so much more convenient to pack, stack, warehouse, librarize your books when their dimensions are the same with each other. I have relatively little sympathy for unique snowflake artistic book design; sure, it can be an impressive work of applied cross-medium art to make an unique book that truly knows no boundaries, and it can be enjoyable to handle and look at, but in the long term such a book is just a pain in the ass to own and handle as part of your bibliologistics. (Fortunately this issue is quickly going away, what with the digital revolution making paper books unnecessary altogether.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426463/#Comment_426463" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-02T07:28:47+00:00" title="January  2, 2014  7:28AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Based on my observations:<br/><br/>For a while, many true print-on-demand printers (like Lulu.com) only offered 6x9 and 8.5x11 for perfectbound books.
