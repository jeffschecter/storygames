Most of them are learned through imitation, which I believe sets a heavy burden on expanding the hobby. Like, sometimes there isn't a clear way to figure out how to play an RPG if you haven't played something similar before or come up with your own technique to deal with it. You can notice in the way you can read a rule but don't really grasp it until you read the example of play given a the bottom of the rule. Or even, until you see how different players deal with it in the same session. An then you have to test it further by putting it in practice and seeing if your way of doing it gets the acceptance of the group, by either them finding it interesting or you pushing to make your opinion prevail, etc.<br/><br/>Some of them are thought to be just good GMing, something that you can only get by playing a lot of cool games with cool GMs and talented players. A lot have been written only as player/gm advice and have never been truly integrated into the game as rules, when they can be not only fun but crucial to implement in order to achieve a determined mood to the game, and much more.<br/><br/>I'm looking for a list of techniques, or any ideas of what could be an interesting technique. I knw there are games that already employ them, but I'm wondering why aren't more of  games like those out there. Allow me to bring those that were already listed in the other thread:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>As a leader of a game;<br/><b>Start by shaking hands with each and every player</b><br/>Effect: establishing a private space between you ...<br/>- makes you focus on and evaluate the player; helps you communicate during game-play<br/>- makes the player trust in your authority, as you are ready to meet him eye-to-eye<br/>- grows mutual respect between you<br/><br/>As a player of a game;<br/><b>Listen in on scenes of other players</b><br/>Effect: strengthening the shared interactive space ...<br/>- makes the game run smoothly; less catch-up dialogue is needed<br/>- makes the players feel their scenes, dialogues and actions are valued by others<br/>- establish<i>the game</i>as focal point of the evening<br/><br/>As a leader of a game;<br/><b>Touch a player in interaction</b><br/>Effect: triggering automatic emotional response ...<br/>- strengthens emotional content of fiction<br/>- widens the interactive field of the game,<br/>- deepens immersion in character<br/><br/>As a player of a serious game;<br/><b>Close your eyes and calm yourself before game-start</b><br/>Effect: introducing the game as a "different space" ...<br/>- awaken imaginative powers<br/>- creates expectation of something special<br/>- brings you out of everyday life, into game-mode</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ivan</cite><br/>I believe that in Blood Red Sand you have to actually stand up when challenging someone's fiction.<br/>In Polaris you have ritual phrases.<br/>In Silver &amp; White there is a touch dynamic (between characters, not players though)</blockquote>\nAnd let me start with a random idea for a technique. If you are familiar with the Dark Tower books by Stephen King, the phrase "You have forgotten the face of your father" will definitely give you a particular feeling. What if you implement it on DitV to deal with players blocking the fiction, or as a tool to push parts of the fiction further?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368015/#Comment_368015" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-15T22:47:19+00:00" title="March 15, 2012 10:47PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: WarriorMonk</cite>Techniques are the social interaction methods used by the players to engage the mechanics of a game as a group.</blockquote>\nI'm not sure I understand this definition.<br/><br/>There have been some attempts at various sites at collecting techniques - often freeform techniques - in one thread/place.

(I think a lot of people do this.)  Even though it's a shared document, reading them aloud sends the social cue that they're important, and this is the agenda for what's to follow.<br/><br/>I've recently started asking the players what their OOC intention for the session is, what they hope will happen.  Last time we did this, the main hope was to have a session with the main protagonists together, which was easily achieved once we knew it was what we all wanted.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_368207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368207/#Comment_368207" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-16T22:24:55+00:00" title="March 16, 2012 10:24PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 16, 2012 10:25PM by WarriorMonk.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Thomas. The definition I used sounds better in spanish so let's please use yours. Allow me to copypaste and expand here what I added on the other thread: \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: WarriorMonk</cite>I'm also wondering if this field has been explored before, using another different term. Anyway, I insist that about the techniques part what we are looking for is somewhere hidden among the lines of Social Psychology studies. Priming is actually part of that area, but Social Psychology focuses more around how it's used in human interaction than on the ways each individual processes it internally, which are more closer to what we are looking for.<br/><br/>The first problem I've found when trying to define what could be considered a technique and what not is that we are talking about tools humans use to interact with each other. Gestures, noises, spoken words, signs and icons are the raw material for building these tools. From the universe of possibilities of human comunication we want to extract only those tools that are pertinent to gaming and focusing it more, the ones we could use for playing RPGs.<br/><br/>The tools we're looking for are among the ones we use to<b>tell stories</b>but there is also an important amount of tools that belong to the field of<b>negotiation</b><br/><br/>Things like framing scenes, using body language to help ellicit emotions in the players, keeping them focused and setting a pace to the narration are part of storytelling. We aren't going here into how to make stories, just into the part of how to tell them to other people and help them feel a part of the fiction, in the emotional sense.<br/><br/>Things like paying atenttion to players flags, the witch mountain trick, worldbuilding with the players, GM fiat, plot points, passing the spotlight, etc are different ways to approach negotiation.</blockquote>\nOk, the techniques I use for framing scenes are usually a description of the place and/or the NPCs and monsters in it. It's always followed by the question <i>"What do you do now?"</i> to prompt for their input: actions, reactions and precautions taken by their characters, further questions about the place or the characters, etc.<br/><br/>Then I negotiate with them. <br/>-I ask for rolls if they want to know more specific information<br/>-I give them the chance to get plot points by making their characters get into trouble (hacking FATE here) and let them add things to the fiction or avoid making rolls when they spend a plot point. (players usually don't get more than 3, maybe 7 sometimes)<br/>-I make things happen when they go OOC for too long <br/>-sometimes I don't ask for input from all the players, but only from those who haven't got enough spotlight in the session so far. Those who just had bad rolls in the last scene also receive more spotlight in the next.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
