Thor posed a question about how exploration worked in D&amp;D. The only way to truly answer the question was to play the game. So I broke out my Moldvay red basic books and B1 In Search of the Unknown. We've played four sessions. <br/><br/>I'll refrain from comment about the quality of the content of the adventure. <br/><br/>We had six characters (and six players): two fighters, a dwarf, a magic user, a cleric and a thief. It was a robust first level party. One of the fighters had recently been killed by a zombie. His player took control of a bandit NPC working with the group. <br/><br/>Since we're playing Moldvay D&amp;D, we have a mapper, a back up mapper and a caller as the rules insist. When we started out, there were many groans about mapping. Some of the players new to D&amp;D wondered aloud why we had to do such a thing. One veteran of another kind of D&amp;D made lots of disgruntled noises about mapping. The roles of the mappers and caller rotate each session. The rules suggest it and it's a good way to get everyone involved and make sure no one is left out.<br/><br/>Our story begins with our characters standing around a magic rock, each eating chips of it. Don't ask. It's In Search of the Unknown. While eating said rock, one character is turned invisible and one is teleported to another unexplored room of the dungeon. The teleport victim was a fighter and one of the mappers. Fortunately, the main group still had its back up mapper (the former bandit). Spooked, the five characters remaining in the main party still eating the rock decided to head out. But before they left, they wanted check out this one little tunnel on the map. They got confused and a little turned around\u2026and were ambushed by five hobgoblins who had been hiding out in a small room at the end the questionable passage. The group had passed this way before but the hobgoblins had remained hidden\u2014since they were out-numbered. Now it appeared the group had been diminished: it seemed there were only four remaining. So they ambushed them and demanded all of their treasure. The group parlayed but couldn't sway the hobgoblins. Neither would they give up their treasure! Thus, a bloody melee ensued. The invisible character\u2014a rather formidable cleric\u2014just missed her surprise attack and was subsequently killed by an enraged hobgoblin. The valiant dwarven veteran commanded his friends to retreat while he held off the attackers. He was slain after sustaining two brutal blows. The clever mage tossed oil to cover their retreat and the two surviving thieves and the mage used their map to beat a hasty retreat to one of the dungeon exits. To use the map, they had to describe to me the turns they were taking and the rooms they were entering. I didn't describe the dungeon to them. I only confirmed their location by repeating familiar descriptions. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, our lost fighter was in the dark, alone\u2026but he had a map with him. He used his sword as a walking stick and managed to find that he was in a sort of cul-de-sac with a webbed entranced. Huddling into the corner, he shredded some hemp rope and used two crossbow bolts to spark a fire. This was resolved with a Wisdom check. He has a Wisdom 11. He managed to pass the test. With light, he could see that he was alone in an unfamiliar section of the dungeon. Furthermore, the player had just witnessed his friends get slaughtered in a fight. He was on edge.<br/><br/>After burning his way out of the webs, he began to carefully navigate this area. In order to create a sense of dislocation, I stopped providing compass directions (as is customary in our dungeon exploration). I described everything as right, left, forward and back. And I only described what he could see\u2014only 30' around him by torchlight. After a 10 minutes of map navigation (and an hour of in-game exploration and thus two wandering monster checks and one torch expended), he managed to find his way back to familiar territory. Once he was reoriented, he sauntered toward a passage that lead to an exit. But there he spotted multiple sets of beady, black reflective eyes attracted by his torchlight (my next wandering monsters check came up positive). These creatures seemed to be mucking about with a pit trap that the party had disarmed earlier. He beat a hasty retreat down a long side passage and hid. There, much to my surprise, he described his character dousing his torch and moving back in the direction of the creatures.<br/><br/>As we all know, D&amp;D underdwellers can see in the dark (but usually only out to 60'). This plan was only going to get him killed. Or so I thought. There were three possible passages he could have retreated down. All were longer than these creatures could see. So I rolled randomly to determine which one they were checking and didn't tell him. He told me he wanted to touch the right hand wall with his hand and move quietly along it, following its curve. At this point, all of the other players were watching and listening, cringing at his careful steps. <br/><br/>I told him to make a Dex check. He had stepped out behind the creatures and was moving away from them. They weren't looking in his direction, but they were RIGHT THERE. He has a Dex of 8. You should have heard his voice crack when he passed the test. He moved away from his pursuers with a firm plan in mind to follow this wall until he could reorient himself. Well, as he moved in this direction, I told him he could smell faint smoke. When he stopped at a junction, I told him he could hear the popping of bones and the tearing of sinew in the distance. And he could hear a quiet voice whisper in a language he couldn't understand. He continued to go forward. An arrow whistled through the air and cracked against the wall next to him. He flinched, but he kept going. Unfortunately, his map of this area wasn't completely accurate. Describing how his character moved, telling me which hand he was using to follow the wall, he ended up in a room with no exit. And his pursuers were the self-same hobgoblins who had run off his companions. They followed him into the room and blocked the exit. <br/><br/>With nothing to lose he says, "I parlay. 'I suppose you want my treasure.'" We rolled on the reaction chart (plus his Charisma bonus) and came up with the Monster Uncertain result. I rolled a D6 looking for a result of a 1 to see if the hobgoblins spoke common. One did. They told him to dump his treasure. He readily did so. We rolled again on the reaction chart and he got an "Enthusiastic" response. So they laughed, clapped him on the back and told him he could be on his way, but before he left, "Could we borrow a couple of torches?" "Sure, what for?" "Don't ask."<br/><br/>Shaking but relieved to be alive, he took a moment to try to light another torch and failed. Still shaking and still in the dark, he pressed on. Shortly, he came within in sight of a glowing cave that the group had already plundered. His light-deprived eyes drank deep. And he took a moment to use the light to ignite his own torch. Moving confidently but cautiously now, he made a circuitous journey to his goal: the stairs up to the first level. The path to the dungeon exit that his friends had escaped from was now blocked by at least two groups of creatures.<br/><br/>Another wandering monsters check came up\u2026positive. Bad luck for him. A huge spider dropped from the ceiling 40' behind him. Both character and monster were surprised (I suppose the player was too). Without hesitation he blurted, "I run!" They had fought two of these creatures already. He knew how tough and deadly they could be. I referenced their respective movement rates. The spider pursued, but it appeared that they had the same pursuit rates. The player even tried to have his character toss his armor off so he could run faster, but he had a torch in one hand and the map in the other. No free hands to do anything else. And this is when it all clicked. The spider couldn't catch him\u2026so long as he successfully navigated via his map. <br/><br/>The player nervously rattled off directions according to his map. I checked them against my map. He found the stairs to the upper level. In my evil GMness, I let the spider close half the distance on the stairs since it could take some vertical short cuts. The player rapidly produced his map of the first level. He narrated a turn and then cursed. "No. Fuck." He'd taken a wrong turn. "Oh yes," I intoned evilly. He was heading down a passage that had two options: an outlet and a dead end. The player quickly reoriented himself toward the outlet. He headed through a door the group had previously unlocked. Slammed into the far wall, turned left and ran for his life. Ahead of him was a secret door that the group had spiked open when they were exploring the first level. He dashed through it and thence down and out to the exit. The spider didn't pursue beyond the dungeon. He's not that kind of spider. And it would have just been a cruel move on my part. This is our first adventure. There's nothing outside this dungeon.<br/><br/>Everyone cheered. "Shaking. My hands are shaking." <br/>"I can't believe you're alive!"<br/>"Me neither! You bastards! You left me!"<br/>"It was that map. The map saved you."<br/>Everyone agreed. Everyone looked at the map with renewed interest and understanding. And I certainly understood at that moment.<br/><br/>Without the map it would have been a total-party-kill. With the maps, two fell fighting but four survived.<br/><br/>You enter the dungeon and begin the orderly process of mapping. You try to maintain that order for as long as possible. Eventually, chaos creeps in and your friends start to die. That map is the only thing between you and a horrific death in the pitch dark corridor of some forgotten corner of this hell hole. Exploration of the dungeon space is an attempt to bring order to chaos, an attempt to glean knowledge from information, separate signal from noise. But unfortunately, exploration brings you in contact with many unforeseen elements, some of which can only be survived via the map.<br/><br/>-L                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_361518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361518/#Comment_361518" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-22T22:50:13+00:00" title="February 22, 2012 10:50PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A dark tale with a splendid moral at the end.<br/><br/>I like these:<br/>"glean knowledge from information"<br/>"separate signal from noise"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_361549">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361549/#Comment_361549" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T00:45:39+00:00" title="February 23, 2012 12:45AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And so the tall tale of the lost fighter who made some hobgoblin mates and ran faster than the nasty arachnid is born.

I imagine that the rule is an outgrowth of the natural tendency of the players to select a leader for the enterprise. I mean, we don't have a caller as a systemic mandate, but one still emerges with practically any mix of players. It's just the nature of the practice that a hard core of two people forms within the party: one is the nominal leader while the other is the mapper, and these two debate the choices the party faces. (Sometimes there are three, in which case it's leader, aide, mapper.) The others listen, and interject with their ideas, and tell their opinions when asked for them. And when the GM wants to know whether any decisions have been made and actions prepared, he turns towards the naturally emergent caller/leader to ask: "OK, are you going to do anything?" Or, as happens often after the deliberative bit, the leader strings out a terse flow of orders and contingencies that everybody at the table takes for granted; he has authority born of natural social interaction.<br/><br/>This party leader role is procedurally all but equivalently important to the GM, for this player may, should he wish, mandate both direction and pacing. Anybody who's played modern drama games knows that these two things alone are like two thirds of the entire imaginary space. The GM is often for long periods of time a secondary star in this constellation, when compared to the party leader and his trusty sergeant/mapper.<br/><br/>In yesterday's session our group for some reason swapped the traditional leader and mapper - or rather, Timo took on both roles himself. This probably had something to do with Sipi's main character being stuck in a mushroom forest in another dungeon, so he played the decidedly laid-back and sassy "Mandrage the Magician" instead. This had decided impact on the effectiveness of the party, as Timo's certainly a fine player, but he's not at home as the caller: the point of debate gets lost, decisions do not get made and the GM has to request "your actions, gentlemen" several times before the party comes upon an acceptable plan.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_361567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361567/#Comment_361567" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T02:52:35+00:00" title="February 23, 2012  2:52AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2012 2:53AM by Teataine.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Luke, your dungeon stories are always the freaking best.<br/><br/>I agree with Eero that the "caller" role may sound very artificial (and judging by Mike Mornard's accounts very related to Gary's early running of the game), but it segways elegantly and naturally into the "party leader" role, that I've seen emerge organically in most of my D&amp;D play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_361603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361603/#Comment_361603" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T07:07:48+00:00" title="February 23, 2012  7:07AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I was a lad, I took one look at the AD&amp;D caller rules and fell back, aghast with horror. How could such a thing be <i>legal</i>? What depraved fascist would ever perpetrate such a crime? How dare these dull game designers try to impose their will on my self-expression!<br/><br/>Now 30 years later, I think the caller is one of the best rules in D&amp;D. The caller is like a player-side GM, or even a union rep for the players. When everyone is screaming and howling, it's the caller's job to get things in order and pass on instructions to the GM. <br/><br/>Since Moldvay D&amp;D is about dungeon exploration, the caller is a very functional role. The group is constantly making minute decisions about direction, rate, light, search, noise, etc. The caller ensures that everyone at table is acting in concert. As noted from my example, if everyone simply headed off on his or her own, not only would it be unmanageable table chaos, but the adventure would be short-lived (as would the adventurers). <br/><br/>And the game is specific when it says the other players are welcome to give their input and roleplay their characters, but the caller is the one responsible for relaying info the DM. Also, in combat the role of the caller recedes and the DM is responsible for addressing each player as necessary.<br/><br/>One of our house rules is that the group sits in marching order from left to right around the table. The front rank sits to the GM's left; if he's not in the front rank, the caller sits at the GM's right hand (in the back rank).<br/>Last night, the group was so rambunctious I couldn't even hear the caller giving instructions. This caused a number of miscues. But it's fun to say that it's not my fault if I can't hear the caller! Being absolved of the duty of polling every character about every decision is fantastic. It makes the intense dungeon exploration manageable since D&amp;D DMs have to do so much heavy lifting. <br/><br/>The game advises that the caller be the character with the highest Charisma and that he or she should lead from the front. It doesn't explain why. I can guess why, but we chose to go another route. We rotate caller duties session to session. This process gives each session a particular character. One caller kept the group focused and quiet. One merely fueled the fires of insanity. One was democratic, and another was capricious. <br/><br/>As I noted above, playing with a caller is a new experience for me. I love it. I love both the functionality of it and its emergent properties. <br/><br/>-L                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_361613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361613/#Comment_361613" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T07:56:39+00:00" title="February 23, 2012  7:56AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I loved reading this AP and it sounds really fun.

Luke gave each group a Turn of action before shifting to the other group. About half an hour in, two of us had dead characters and three had escaped the dungeon, leaving only the one who was lost and alone to find his way out.

He or she polls everyone on what they want to do and breaks ties before relaying information to the GM. The caller also tells the GM when the party switches from marching order to lock-picking/trap-finding order to door opening/smashing order.The other players can talk to the GM too, it's just that (generally) we don't actually take action until the Caller says what we do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_361621">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361621/#Comment_361621" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T08:19:58+00:00" title="February 23, 2012  8:19AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2012 8:21AM by Luke_Wheel.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Jason,<br/>At first, I alternated between the two groups turn by turn. Time tracking in this version of D&amp;D is pretty easy. Their exploration rate was 60' of dungeon per 10 minutes. So once the lone fighter (X the Veteran) had explored his 60' I cut back to the group. <br/><br/>As it turns out X got stuck in the web for four turns while the group took two turns exploring an unknown tunnel. They then got into it with the hobgoblins which took another turn. Then they ran. So by the time X was free, they had left dungeon. Regardless of the in-game events, we did have 30 minutes of one player reading map directions on his own. Waiting that long for one player is taxing on the group's patience. Some folks were bored. Some were listening. Some were making up new characters. <br/><br/>As for the caller, we haven't developed a veto rule yet. So far the group has been fine with letting the caller make the ultimate decision. I think this has two components: 1) Everyone knows they're going to get a turn now. 2) Finding your way about the dungeon requires focus and communication with the mappers. If you're not paying close attention, you're kind of fucking lost. So at any given time at least two players have no fucking clue where they are.<br/><br/>Six players is a massive group for a Burning Wheel game, but it feels right for this version of D&amp;D. I certainly wouldn't want to do anything that let the players explore their individual agendas, though. That's when you get five players bored to death while one player says really dumb shit in a funny voice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_361624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361624/#Comment_361624" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T08:28:49+00:00" title="February 23, 2012  8:28AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks guys.

And that's exactly what we set out looking for. We wanted to see how the rules of (this version of) D&amp;D created the feel of exploration. The mapping is painful. The pain never stops, but soon the benefits of the map seem to overshadow the burden.<br/><br/>The benefits we found:<br/>Ritualistic activity: The mappers came to enjoy their task since they were intimately involved in every decision<br/>Descriptive immersion: When they were lost but stumbled into a familiar area known by its description, the players would cheer for triumph and sigh for relief\u2026and then consult the map for orientation.<br/>Shifting power dynamic: at the start of the game, the players have a blank sheet of paper with one node, the entry. Basically, lots of information, but no knowledge. Their every step had to be exhaustively described by me in the capacity of DM. As the game progressed, they sifted through the information and created knowledge and as they retraced their steps and filled in details, they described more and more of the dungeon to me.<br/>Artifact: The map became a representation of progress and, even better, a sort of save point.<br/>Exploration: They used the map as it was intended and intuited the position and content of unexplored areas: to wit, they found the stairs up by collating data from their level 1 map with their relative position on the level 2 map.<br/>Salvation: Without the maps, their characters would have perished in the dungeon. This of course is the greatest reward for mapping. However, this reward only emerges if mapping and describing rituals are strictly enforced.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: skinnyghost</cite><br/>We ran a big marathon session of B2 last Sunday - my group had 6 casualties (3 PCs, 3 hirelings) and when the PCs died, we just filled in the details for a hireling and they got "upgraded".  This is one incredibly useful trait of retainers; they're always around, ready to take up the torch, so to speak.</blockquote>\nI liked the NPC to PC dynamic. I think we'll codify it as a house rule.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>If the map gets destroyed in the game (say, the group holding the map is killed), do you take the map from the players?</blockquote>\nWell, they took a dunk an a water-filled pit at one point. I had the mappers make DEX checks keep the maps safe. They both passed. The players then asked what would have happened if they failed. I told them, "I would have taken the maps into the shower." They howled with a mix of dismay and delight.<br/><br/>-L                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_361815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361815/#Comment_361815" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T14:06:29+00:00" title="February 23, 2012  2:06PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Entertaining AP Luke!<br/>I wonder how long having a caller holds up?

The details are spare (but often unintentionally hilarious). <br/>Descriptive conceits that I settled on: <br/>I used compass directions (north, south) unless the group lost its light or bearings at which time I used relative bearing (left, right). <br/>I described distances in feet according to the map. A 20' x 20' room, the wall extends 40' ahead.<br/>I only told the humans what they could see according to their lantern light. 30' from the light source.<br/>I described what the Dwarf could see 60' from his position. <br/>In rooms larger/longer than those directions, I described darkness at the limits of sight. Though I would often fuck this up and describe a lurking monster before it could be seen.<br/><br/>According to the rules, I'm obligated to accurately describe the environs explored by the players. However, I am not obligated to correct their map if it develops inaccuracies. In fact, I'm instructed not to by the game. Which is MUCH HARDER THAN IT SEEMS. <br/><br/>In practice, I answered the players' questions about a room until they were satisfied unless they were in the dark, running or in a fight.<br/><br/>I am totally on the players' side. I want them to succeed and get all the treasure. My instinct is to help them. But it's vital to resist that impulse entirely. Let the map be drawn and the dice fall where they may! It's how this version of D&amp;D is played.

What's the vibe like for thieves in your RAW Moldvay, Luke?  Low level thieves always seemed like weak sauce dungeon passengers to young me.  They're fragile and their skill ratings suck so they're not providing much in the way of specialist skill to the party.

What's the vibe like for thieves in your RAW Moldvay, Luke?  Low level thieves always seemed like weak sauce dungeon passengers to young me.  They're fragile and their skill ratings suck so they're not providing much in the way of specialist skill to the party.  Worst of all, in order to use their backstab they have to grub for fictional positioning without provoking a test of those sucky skills.<br/><br/>2. How are you setting stakes for rolls?  What kind of results are you getting out of failed rolls?  I think Moldvay is pretty binary about die rolls -- either the intended action happens successfully or it does not.</blockquote>\nHi Johnzo,<br/>Good questions. The thief is useless at first level, but everyone is. Fighters are marginally less useful because they might (MIGHT) be able to take a hit before going down. Our thief player (who might be a sort of famous game designer) was really grumbly about this fact until he scored a +2 Spear. Now he's very confident. But from my perspective, I think he undervalued himself. With a high DEX and position at the rear of the marching order, he would often provide solid missile support: short range is +1 to hit, DEX 13 is +1 to hit. Since everyone has the same to-hit tables, he was more accurate than the fighters. And it showed. Our little thief brought down quite a few opponents. I even surprised him with a huge spider from above and he survived untouched.<br/><br/>As for grubbing for "fictional positioning," I'm sure you won't be surprised to hear that I simply don't stand for it. If he wants his bonus, he needs to successfully hide in shadows or move silently. He is allowed to test these abilities in combat as he moves so long as he is not in melee with an enemy. And, of course, so long as it makes sense in the dungeon. He hasn't succeeded yet. I'd also give him his due if he managed to surprise an opponent from behind. So that's an olive branch from game mechanics (mapping, movement, surprise) to fictional positioning ("behind" is a construct since there are no facing rules).<br/><br/>2. Hm. I dunno. This is more complex than it seems. For search tests, failure is decided by the map. I do not introduce false clues or disaster unless instructed to do so by the map/module. So there are lots of null results. For combat results, I describe failure graphically, but simply. I loathe the soul-crushing two word mantra: "I miss." There are no additional effects for failing in combat except that if you miss, you're probably going to die. So the tension runs high there. For stat tests, failure is often implicit in the situation. They don't have something; they want to make something; they don't know something; they don't want to die; etc. For most stat tests, the player is starting from a deficit, so the stakes are "you either climb out of the hole or you're stuck in here."<br/><br/>Due to my degenerate ideas about task and conflict resolution, I do not allow retests for the same method versus the same objective. Of course, nowhere in Moldvay does it say I should allow a player to retest, neither does it say I should call for tests until he or she fails. On page B60, Mr Moldvay indicates that "There's Always a Chance" thus DM's should use stat tests to resolve challenges not covered by magic, combat, special abilities, saving throws and spells. He goes on to add "Everything Is Balanced." This is an very interesting piece of advice: "The DM should try to maintain 'balance of play.'" He talks about treasure and monsters, but also difficulty. He says nothing about stakes, but it does seem like he's saying "Be fair; be reasonable." And thus I shall plant my flag there and say retests are unfair and unreasonable so they are out. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Noofy</cite>I have a question too!

Since everyone has different weapons, I can't remember all of their damage dice. Thus they roll for their damage. I agree that the DM rolling for damage seems outmoded and clunky. But I get it now. Keeping the damage private ratchets up the tension. Players don't know how far along the monster is thus they must rely on description, rather than the damage-counting player deflating everything saying, "Well, he's taken 9 HP of damage so far and he's level 2 so\u2026" [Actual Example From Play!] Unfortunately, I'm a rather disorganized DM so even though I should be rolling for damage, I can't.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hans c-o</cite><cite>Posted By: Luke Wheel</cite>Oh ho, not so fast.

In order to map, the game instructs that the character must be near the front of the party and must have hands free and a light source. So the game is quite clear: If you are mapping, your character is mapping. It's a direction correlation between player action and character action. <br/><br/>But check this out: That's all the character does. He's not involved in mapping in any other way (unless a spell is cast but that's different). The character doesn't get better or more skilled at mapping. Ever. The player cannot test his character's Wisdom or Intelligence to see if he maps the room accurately or inaccurately. You don't level up and get better maps. And once it's established that you're the mapper, you never describe your <i>character</i> mapping. It's the player who maps. It's he or she who must listen to instructions. It's his or her skill that improves. The character is merely a thin constraint so it feels like you're playing a roleplaying game.<br/><br/>While this version of D&amp;D is most assuredly a roleplaying game, it is one focused on player skill. This game is primarily about mapping. Everything else is ancillary. And the players map, not the characters. The mapping character is just a mannequin holding blank piece of paper. <br/><br/>Maybe everyone else had this figured out years ago, but my degenerate mind is blown.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362320/#Comment_362320" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T09:38:24+00:00" title="February 24, 2012  9:38AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Luke Wheel</cite>As for grubbing for "fictional positioning," I'm sure you won't be surprised to hear that I simply don't stand for it.</blockquote>\nI am surprised a bit.

My idea of successful thief play kinda comes from the old Ron Edwards essay about T&amp;T, which says that the critical T&amp;T player skill is manipulating the fiction and the game master so that the unforgiving mechanics are not engaged.<br/><br/>This is absolutely the case with D&amp;D as well. However, once you're in a fight, the mechanics are inexorable. They are the clock ticking down your doom. Also, since I am a degenerate, if a player is describing something that clearly pertains to a game mechanic i.e. "I sneak around behind him." then I am going to engage the game mechanic. If the players can think of something clever that doesn't drag them into combat, magic or saving throws, I am willing to hear them out.<br/><br/>For example, our intrepid adventures came upon a room with naught but a crystal goblet at its center. Clever as they were, they did not enter. They examined the floor and ceiling from the door. They noted the uneven floor was shot through with fist-sized holes. They debated. One of them fetched a rock from a nearby cavern. They tossed the rock (with a DEX test) into one of the holes and waited (and listened). Listening was a regular Hear Noise check, but triggered by the successful DEX check. One of them heard the scuttling of many little feet. They decided not to go into the room.<br/><br/>In the case of the Great Escape described above. No tests were made. The player used "fictional positioning" via the map to escape. <br/><br/>Also, I just realized that I completely nuked believability and consistency when I gave the fighter a DEX test to sneak past the goblins. He had a 40% chance, whereas the thief's raw score was 10 or 15%. I suppose that could have been fixed by giving the thief a hefty bonus\u2014which is an acceptable practice according to the rules.<br/><br/>Anyway.<br/>Onward!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362333/#Comment_362333" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T10:04:58+00:00" title="February 24, 2012 10:04AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Weirdly, though I have played a lot of basic D&amp;D, this never really came up for us. Like, we had mappers, usually whoever in the play group was the best artist, and they were fine. Sometimes the map was off a bit and we laughed and fixed it. I don't recall the GM ever correcting our mapping, but it's possible it was just because it was such a non-issue. Come to think of it, our usual mapper was a very talented artist with a good sense of visual space, so that might have had something to do with it being a non-issue.<br/><br/>Contrariwise, the issues of fictional positioning to avoid combat were <i>huge</i> in my play. Because combat, particularly at levels 1-3, is essentially a death sentence, we went to great lengths to avoid it, mostly involving building our own traps and devices (what is a thief good for? setting up fire traps.)

He had a 40% chance, whereas the thief's raw score was 10 or 15%. I suppose that could have been fixed by giving the thief a hefty bonus\u2014which is an acceptable practice according to the rules.<br/><br/>Yeah, this was something I wondered about.  I think the D&amp;D thief's niche is a little wide, especially in a game where the best strategy is often to avoid confrontation.  Everyone should be able to attempt sneaks and climbs!<br/><br/>Looking at how terrible thief skills are at low levels, it seems like good dungeon design won't funnel the party through territory where thief skill failure will trap the players or block them from any forward exploration.  Maybe thief success should be used to gain access to the softer parts of the dungeon -- shortcuts, treasure caches, barracks full of sleeping hobgoblins.  So the thief's success can be the difference between survival and victory, which makes them worth the trouble to escort through the dungeon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362358/#Comment_362358" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T10:40:35+00:00" title="February 24, 2012 10:40AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Troy,<br/>I want to say "No! Of course not. A forest is a dungeon, just outside!" But in my heart I don't believe that's true. Conceptually, a forest and a dungeon are very different. And in execution, a dungeon is a maze of narrow corridors\u2014you're pressed against your companions by the very walls around you. No matter how you cut it, that's not what a forest is. You get lost in the trees, wander off and get mugged. Picked off one by one.<br/><br/>Sure, you could do it, but at this point, with the Moldvay rules, I believe D&amp;D happens in the dungeon. Once you leave the dungeon, you're heading into the REAL unknown and 40 years of trouble.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362369/#Comment_362369" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T11:03:01+00:00" title="February 24, 2012 11:03AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The outdoors doesn't become an adventure location until level 4 and the David Cook Edited Expert set.<br/><br/>Before that, you mostly handwave outdoorsy stuff.

I'm reading ahead now. Keep has a few miles of outdoors travel, but it's minor. I'm worried that some of the other modules will try to prematurely impose this shittiness on the group before they reach 4th level. Though it's looking unlikely that anyone will make it to 2nd level. Even so, the wilderness adventures (and expert set in general) are so terrible, the group is going to have to talk before we proceed past that point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cy" title="cy"><img alt="cy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cy">cy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362386/#Comment_362386" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T11:38:22+00:00" title="February 24, 2012 11:38AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm curious if you stuck to the Caller role for the isolated adventurer's escape trek?

The lost fighter became a party of one and the defacto mapper and caller for himself. This is potentially problematic! But we'll see if it arises again. If it does -- if we get a lot of split party events -- we'll address it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362443/#Comment_362443" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T14:30:20+00:00" title="February 24, 2012  2:30PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2012 2:32PM by John_Harper.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love this thread!<br/><br/>I am no expert on Basic D&amp;D, but I've always understood the Thief skills to represent the ability to do those things in an instant, under pressure (like the middle of combat), or in crazy situations (climbing a featureless smooth wall). In that light, the tiny percentages at 1st level make sense (except for climbing, which is crazy good).<br/><br/>Of course, anyone can attempt to hide, or move quietly, or climb in <i>normal</i> conditions, and a stat check seems like the thing to do given "There's Always a Chance." So, the Fighter's 40% chance in the dark corridor is fine. The Thief has a 10% chance to hide in shadows, <i>in the middle of combat</i>, with monsters looking right at him. That's a huge deal.<br/><br/>The rules don't convey this idea at all, mind you. It's a method I picked up by osmosis from some old-timers, and it's codified in some of the OSR texts (<i>Swords &amp; Wizardry</i>, for one). But "as written" the Thief skills can be read much more conservatively, and they basically suck.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362452/#Comment_362452" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T14:46:52+00:00" title="February 24, 2012  2:46PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/John">@John</a><br/><br/>Rich Forest had some similar rules interpretations. One bit is that, by, looking at the descriptions of thief skills, we realize that these are not normal sneaking around, but actually nigh-magical abilities. For instance, I believe the hide in shadows ability explicitly states that the thief is *invisible* on a successful check. Which is kinda cool.<br/><br/>I never played that way. To me, the big boost of the thief is that they advance very, very quickly. By the time the elf is level 2, the thief is nearly level 4. This makes a huge difference in terms of hit points, access to high level abilities like followers, and so on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362455/#Comment_362455" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T14:51:33+00:00" title="February 24, 2012  2:51PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, Rich Forest is one of the "old timers" that I got that reading from. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362465/#Comment_362465" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T15:23:33+00:00" title="February 24, 2012  3:23PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pics!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362493/#Comment_362493" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T17:01:18+00:00" title="February 24, 2012  5:01PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2012 5:01PM by johnzo.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Luke Wheel</cite>For example, our intrepid adventures came upon a room with naught but a crystal goblet at its center.

Why anyone would go on this shit quest is also unknown.<br/><br/>Actually, the Moldvay formula is 3-8 <i>adventures</i> per level. This is born out by the B module series: Nine adventures for characters L1-3. <br/><br/>This formula speaks to me of a very different style of gaming, but it also hints at a reason why players used to go apeshit and strip dungeons of everything that wasn't nailed down. Advancement makes a man hungry and mean.<br/><br/>Also, hilariously, they don't want to go back into QUASQUETON. At least that was the sentiment when we closed out last session: FUCK THAT PLACE. We're going to vote on it next session so we'll see if their memories of getting slaughtered by five hobgoblins has grown fond or bitter. I'm going to let them buy rumors for other leads to other dungeons.

Then again, when I ran it the magic rock led to the Realm of Chaos mutation tables and the cleric left the dungeon with a dragon head on his shoulders. I added other stuff too, which I discuss <a href="http://redboxvancouver.wordpress.com/2010/08/18/old-school-modules-actually-rather-boring/" rel="nofollow">here.</a>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Luke Wheel</cite>Actually, the Moldvay formula is 3-8<i>adventures</i>per level.

Funny enough, I took that to mean sessions too, and for some reason assumed 4-hour session because that's what I play, but I suppose that's wrong. My most legendary character was barely third level with 20-something sessions under his belt when he lost and arm and a leg and all his Intelligence.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Luke Wheel</cite>This is born out by the B module series: Nine adventures for characters L1-3.</blockquote>\nThat's interesting. Is that you're natural interpretation of these modules, or are there instructions saying this somewhere (before the collected version, I mean)? Because they're not all one adventure each, right? At least one is a collection of shorter encounters. And when they were collected in a book, with a plot structure stringing them together, some stuff was left out.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Luke Wheel</cite>This formula speaks to me of a very different style of gaming, but it also hints at a reason why players used to go apeshit and strip dungeons of everything that wasn't nailed down.</blockquote>\nApparently treasure is usually gathered in hoards, so if you find them you get massive loot, if you miss them you get nada. At least that's what Planet Algol Blair tells me, and it's also the results I've gotten using the Moldvay dungeon stocking rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362537/#Comment_362537" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T21:41:16+00:00" title="February 24, 2012  9:41PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry.

Would the mapping mechanic break down since it's a much less defined space?</blockquote>\nIn the Expert set, wilderness maps were hex maps - players would advance from hex to hex in the same way that you'd move through a dungeon.  There are rules for getting lost - your orientation gets messed up, so when you think you go one direction, you go another.  I haven't done it, but the kind of chaos this would produce on a map sounds like absolutely no fun whatsoever.<br/><br/>Untangling that mess would be really hard, unless hexes are distinctive.  "The room with the crumbling stairs," is much more specific than "another forest hex".  I think the only saving grace would be that the next sunrise or sunset would presumably reveal the mistake so (with 5-mile hexes) you wouldn't get too far before realizing you'd messed up.  But, unlike a dungeon where you can just nip around a loop quickly, who wants to backtrack 30 miles to fix the mistake?  Distinctive hexes seem like a must.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15909/a-tale-of-two-maps" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15909/a-tale-of-two-maps" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15909/a-tale-of-two-maps/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F15909%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F15909%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
