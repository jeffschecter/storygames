I haven't been to a big con since the Carter administration but the chance to meet so many of you is great enough to brave the geekfunk. <br/><br/>Is there a good way to do GenCon in a day? I assume that I will leave around 4 am to be there at opening and probably stay till they trow us out. I would like a distilled an experience as I can get in that time. I will want to meet as many of you as I can. I might even try to play some games.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88021/#Comment_88021" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-14T10:50:27+00:00" title="August 14, 2007 10:50AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As has been said in other threads, you should try to be around in the evening, after the convention hall has closed (6pm).  Folks tend to congregate in the Embassy Hotel lobby to socialize and play games.  Of course, if you have an early start and a long drive, you might be worn out by then. <br/><br/>During the day, try to hit the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3842&amp;page=1#Item_37" rel="nofollow">Indie Games Explosion / Games On Demand</a> area in the Hyatt Regency.  Lots of this crowd will be there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88022/#Comment_88022" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-14T10:56:16+00:00" title="August 14, 2007 10:56AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's also the Gaming Podcasting Party from 7pm to 9pm at Hyatt Cosmopolitan B, if you're interested in meeting some of the podcasters who frequent here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
