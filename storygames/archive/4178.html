This may be the sim-gamer in me talking, but I don't feel it's appropriate to not give the PC with a better diplomacy score due benefit in an interactive scene, nor do I feel it appropriate not to factor in a player-prompted<i>faux pas</i>into an NPC's response.</blockquote>\nI'm torn on the issue of player performance playing a part in game mechanics. I have an anecdote I tell, and I like it specifically because it's not "combat", whether physical or social.<br/><br/>In a D&amp;D 3.0 game I DMd many years ago, the players had all passed the (for all intents and purposes) "dungeon" entrance when a fairly simple system of ropes, pulleys and counterweights dropped a giant slab of stone behind them, preventing their retreat. The mechanism was, for the most part, located on the outside of the entrance. The party's token Rogue player, an experienced D&amp;D player with plenty of DMing under his belt, states "Alright, I reverse the mechanism and raise the slab again. What's my DC?"<br/><br/>I peered at him suspiciously and responded - "Okaaaayyyy.... exactly <i>how</i> do you intend to reverse the mechanism?" followed by a brief reiteration of what parts of it he could see from his vantage point, which was precious little. He snaps back with "I don't need to tell you that - I'm not a Rogue. My character's a Rogue. He should be able to have a shot at this."<br/><br/>Me: "I can't see a logical way this mechanism can be reversed from where you're standing."<br/>Him: "You are also not a Rogue. Logic has nothing to do with it. What's the DC."<br/><br/>Now, I have a few options: be a dick, and give him a DC that's impossible to beat - which would still imply it could be beat, while I (the designer of the mechanism) knew logically it could not. Or, give him a fair DC and modify it upwards because he can't give me a point of approach. Or just give him a fair DC to make him happy, allow him to roll, and deal with consequences I hadn't foreseen. Or just tell him "No dude, it's impossible".<br/><br/>I don't remember what choice I made and I don't think it's important in the grand scheme of things. What's important is, I still - five years later - have no idea what to make of this story. What are the implications of saying "Your portrayal of the character has exactly zilch to do with hir success" versus "What you say your character is doing makes a huge difference to the results"?<br/><br/>It brings me back to old "whose intelligence can I use to solve puzzles, my own or that of my Uber-Barbarian/Archmage?" discussions.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad" title="Caesar Slaad"><img alt="Caesar Slaad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad">Caesar Slaad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93754/#Comment_93754" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-07T12:37:11+00:00" title="September  7, 2007 12:37PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lachek, I already split this thread. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Sorry, I didn't redirect my response to you as I had the least to say about it directly. But I will say that I agree it's a conundrum; I batted this about a bit and for now, this approach seems to be working for me. I think that to some extent, you have to view the PC as a synthesis of the player's decisions and their character's supposed abilities.<br/><br/>With respect to puzzles: they are the sorts of things I am most comfortable abstracting away, as I find more players have problems with puzzles than any other sort of challenge and it tends to bog play to a stop if a player doesn't get it. I do like mysteries, but I tend to abstract the "information acquisition" stage of the mystery gathering, occasionally providing small situation bonuses if warranted. But otherwise, yeah, I assume things like "a rogue is going to know this" (or as I am a Spycraft fiend, a forensic analyst, etc.)<br/><br/>I've sort of tired of the Zork "what lever" style of play and don't make it much part of my gaming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93944/#Comment_93944" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-08T00:05:45+00:00" title="September  8, 2007 12:05AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 8, 2007 12:06AM by noclue.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, since it was D&amp;D 3.0, there is a very clear way to resolve this issue. The GM, who has story responsibility, decides. You were perfectly within your rights to say "Your rogue skills tell you clearly that from where you are standing there is no possible way to reverse this contraption. The mechanism is blocked by a wall of stone. Perhaps there is a way to get to the mechanism through a door or a corridor further in the dungeon..." There is no DC for impossible. This is probably what I would have done, because I'm angry at this dude just from your description and I have the power of GM fiat.<br/><br/>Now, supposing I was willing to say that the rogue was in a position where he can get to the mechanism. I would hope the player would be willing to narrate some kind of action. If he pulled the "I don't have to tell you that shit," I would pull the "I don't have to play with bastards like you" counter maneuver. If done right, no can defense. As long as he was being cool and playing the same game as I, I wouldn't require him to actually know how to rogue in order to get the benefit of his character's skill, but I would want some attempt at narrating. <br/><br/>Now if we were playing SOTC, then he could spend a fate point and say there's a hidden doorway here that leads back to the mechanism (then I would compel his fear of hidden doorways aspect). If we were playing Dogs he could put out a big raise and say, my hand can just get to the mechanism through the hole in the wall. I would, of course, reverse the blow and state that his hand is stuck in the gears.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93962/#Comment_93962" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-08T02:47:12+00:00" title="September  8, 2007  2:47AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't really speak to the wider issue, since I think it's pretty much game-specific.  That said, I think I tend to prefer not to place any mechanical weight on player performance.  For example, Sorcerer's bonus dice make me a bit uncomfortable when I'm supposed to be awarding them for "cool ideas".  It feels too much like judging my friends.  <br/><br/>In the D&amp;D example, I think I'd side with the player.  Beyond the fact that I try to avoid "unescapable trap" situations, the spirit of the rules suggests to me that all interactions between characters and the world, where the characters are exercising a skill, should be governed by a dice roll.  I'm not a trap designer, and I'm not a Rogue.  In the situation, I'd assume that the trap designer was trying their hardest to make a trap that can't be reversed, and the rogue is trying to reverse the trap.  The dice roll tells you who did their job better.  Of course, you'd be totally within your rights to say that it was a very talented trapmaker, and make an accrdingly difficult DC.  What I'd have done is make a double DC, one value lets the player determine there's a mechanism for reversing the trap deeper in the dungeon, the second, much higher value, reverses the trap.  <br/><br/>But yeah, in general I'm with you, I think.  It's like when I was 12, studying Judo and playing Rolemaster.  My character was wrestling with some NPC.  I won a roll and got to pin the guy, and I described exactly what hold I was using, and how it was completely unbreakable, barring a huge difference in size or strength.  I was *outraged* that I wasn't allowed to automatically win the fight.  Ahh, the joys of youth!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93966/#Comment_93966" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-08T04:23:41+00:00" title="September  8, 2007  4:23AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have to agree with Simon C about the D&amp;D example and side with the player, for essentially the same reasons he gives.  Also, I remember all too well the days of my misspent youth, when an antagonistic GM could turn essentially any in-game problem into a real-life pixelbitching quiz show, and I have no desire to either repeat that experience or see it inflicted on anyone else.  It's not fun, and it's not making the game better.<br/><br/>Also, I'm in the camp that's not comfortable with awarding mechanical bonuses for "cool" narration, or assigning penalties for "uncool" narration.  I can see rewarding a clever <i>idea</i> -- the guy who avoids the locked and reinforced door on the first floor of the police station by scaling a fire escape and using the window that the detectives already jimmied open so they could hang out next to it and smoke is going to get asked to make different rolls than the guy who's trying to pick the lock, and the difficulties of those rolls is likely to be lower.  But the guy who describes climbing the fire escape beautifully and details exactly how he's going to slip through that window's not getting a mechanical advantage over the guy who just says "I try and climb up the fire escape and sneak in the window," any more than the lockpicker who says "I apply pressure to the tension wrench with my left hand while swiftly brushing the tumblers back-to-front" will get an advantage over the player who just says "I rolled 22 on Pick Locks."<br/><br/>And really, why should the more descriptive player's PC ever get that kind of advantage?  Isn't good, fun narration supposed to be its own reward?  Hell, some of the best gaming moments I've had were completely free of mechanics and had no actual problem that my character was solving, they were just pure in-character conversations, motivated entirely by the feeling that what we were saying was awesome and entertaining in its own right.<br/><br/>If I've got an opportunity to use details and description to awesome-ify a task that my PC is trying to accomplish, I'll take that opportunity whether or not there's a mechanical advantage to be gained...and conversely, if the details and description aren't interesting (or are too difficult to provide, like trying to have your Nobel-prize-winning physicist PC explain how he uses a superconducting supercollider when you yourself know absolutely nothing about any of that stuff), then I'm not going to waste my time or anyone else's on it and just rely on the fact that the character knows what he's doing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94015/#Comment_94015" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-08T10:19:30+00:00" title="September  8, 2007 10:19AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>Isn't good, fun narration supposed to be its own reward?</blockquote>\nyes, but sometimes players need mechanical rewards to push them to make the good narration.  especially if they aren't used to it.  several good examples occurred in a brief attempt i made at running a short Exalted: Lunars game this summer.  i was constantly reminding my two players that they'd get stunt dice for nifty narration.  and we got some cool ones.  especially when the lunar in his man/bear hybrid warform hamstringed a tyrant lizard then clawed his way up the body to cut its throat.  good stuff!  but i'm pretty sure i wouldn't have heard nearly as many really nifty bits of narration (which everyone really enjoyed hearing and making) if the mechanical reward hadn't been there.<br/><br/>at the same time, i too feel mildly uncomfortable with some of the recommendations for rewards and penalties in Sorcerer.  still when i run it, i probably will at least use the -1 penalty for anything as bland as "i hit him."  cuz frankly i'm really really tired of that.  as long as i even hear i a "i kick him in the shins and bop him on the nose," or something, i'm feeling pretty good.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94043/#Comment_94043" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-08T12:02:53+00:00" title="September  8, 2007 12:02PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>I don't remember what choice I made and I don't think it's important in the grand scheme of things.

Each different answer gives a different game system, so answering this question is game design. The answer, more than anything else, defines what the game is *about*, at least with regard to what the players will actually *do*.<br/><br/>Think of an old-school D&amp;D game. Gameplay is dominated by the players interacting with physical objects (pillars, trapdoors, traps), asking the GM for better descriptions, pushing at levers, etc. Dice are used for combat and for spell effects but not much else. Lots of people still play this way --- go over to Dragonsfoot or Knights and Knaves and you'll find thread after thread discussing this style. I think Gary Gygax runs his games like this.<br/><br/>That's a competitive, challenge-based game about puzzle solving, common sense, and achieving social influence over the GM.<br/><br/>Move up a level, to the game you described, and say you go along with the player's opinion. And let's assume that rest of the session is more traps and some fights. At each stage, the players chose what abilities to use (some of these being one-shot or limited use) and dice determine the results.<br/><br/>That's a challenge-based game about knowing the rules and using the rules well, both during play and ahead of time (character generation and levelling).<br/><br/>Go even further, it's the game you were playing, but a each decision point (go left or right? fight or flee?) you dice to determine the decision each character makes, then work together to come up with the most interesting dialogue and narration for that.<br/><br/>That's a pretty weird game; even calling it a game is a bit of a stretch. But I'd play it at least once.<br/><br/>I think this issue gets muddied because most rolegame texts have gloss over this aspect, or only refer to it in passing. So it gets decided (organically, over time) at a per-group or per-community level, and gets propagated as an oral tradition.<br/><br/>There's never going to be a "right" answer. Every answer is a potential game, and the answer determines what the role of the players in that game will be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94046/#Comment_94046" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-08T12:08:12+00:00" title="September  8, 2007 12:08PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rob's got the right of it.<br/><br/>The "social influence over the GM" sounds rather ominous, but there is no real difference between that and just plain old communication. All communication is fraught with undertones, power discrepancies, race, gender, class, etc. components, there's nothing we mere mortals can do about it except be aware of it.<br/><br/>There's a player in my group who has been my best friend for 14 years. When I am GM, his plans and ideas sound best to me, and vice versa. We wouldn't be best friends for 14 years if we couldn't quickly get on each other's wavelength.  The key is that in either situation, the person playing must take responsibility for helping other players do the same thing - in other words, spreading their "social influence over the GM" around to those who may not naturally have the same thing, or who may actively have difficulty achieving it for various reasons.<br/><br/>This is a huge gaping hole in GM-player relations that is not addressed by anything in the "how-to-GM" and "how-to-play" texts that I have seen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jzn" title="jzn"><img alt="jzn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jzn">jzn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94240/#Comment_94240" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-09T15:27:28+00:00" title="September  9, 2007  3:27PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 9, 2007 3:37PM by jzn.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Social influence over the DM" sounds like the best handjob wins.  It doesn't allow for the fact that often, people actually have workable ideas that play out logically. <br/><br/>Getting a DM to make a narration in your favor can become a matter of winning him over, but often it is simply a matter of declaring what you do, and having that thing happen.  If a player says "I walk through the door", the DM narrates the door opening.  That's how most roleplaying actions work.  If you say "I call the police", the police come.<br/><br/>Granted, when you get into a situation where it's ambiguous how a move would logically play out, "winning over" the DM can come into play.  A DM who stonewalls you and plays favorites can certainly make you wish you could have just rolled a die.  But much of a DM's job requires logical reactions to simple requests. <br/><br/>Saying that the success of your actions depend on "social influence over the DM" is like saying that court cases are won merely by "social influence over the judge".<br/><br/>But perhaps this is what Rob means when he includes "puzzle solving and common sense" as part of the big picture.  Common sense, on both sides of the game screen, goes a long way towards the goal of keeping a game playable and fair.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94243">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jzn" title="jzn"><img alt="jzn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jzn">jzn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94243/#Comment_94243" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-09T15:49:35+00:00" title="September  9, 2007  3:49PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 9, 2007 3:59PM by jzn.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            oh, but, regarding lachek's specific example:<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't know how you had that trap set up, so I can't tell if it was physically possible to do it from where he was and you wanted him to figure out the lever combination or whatever, or if the trap was only accessible from another location.  In either case, he said he wasn't interested in solving a real life puzzle right then, so you should allow a skill check for it, with a challenging trap DC (nothing outlandish, it would be taken as a declaration that you are mad at him).  If there was no way to do it from where they were, just tell him he takes 20 and finds it impossible.  If there was a way to do it from inside the room, tell him the mechanism after he succeeds the roll.

Likewise, play will go a lot faster if you tell me that you don't want to hassle with in character conversations and would rather just roll dice. Likewise with puzzles and traps.<br><br>My personal method of handling this is to allow both. If you don't want to bother with trying to puzzle out the way around a trap, just get a disarm skill and roll it. But if you do solve it on your own, you'll get bonus XP. If you try to solve it on your own and fail, but get close, I'll give a bonus. My group isn't the type to let things drag out forever, so we haven't seen problems with this. I could see where it might be a problem at some tables though, if a character focuses so tightly on the possible reward and refuses to roll dice.<br/><br/>For the second, I like it when the things I say and do can enhance the game mechanically. Exalted and Scion's stunt dice awards (+1-3 dice depending on the cool factor of your description) have really enhanced the narratives at the table. Our D&amp;D games tended to start with some description, but rapidly degenerate to "I swing at him once, and if he drops I swing at that guy with my second attack." The Exalted campaign covers the same type of fantasy fight scenes, but people are jumping, hopping, and maneuvering like crazy.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94664">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94664/#Comment_94664" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T09:24:56+00:00" title="September 11, 2007  9:24AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2007 9:25AM by lachek.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One note I didn't make a mention of originally, partly because I wanted to see how you all interpreted it, was that I never thought of the mechanism as a "trap" to be "disarmed". To me, it was very simply a mechanism which closed off the entrance. In essence, it was a railroading mechanism that would prevent the party from venturing outside the dungeon for supplies and healing. The idea was to add a strong element of resource management and exploration to the adventure. It backfired on me pretty badly.<br/><br/>I have learned two things from this situation:<br/><br/>1. Don't railroad. If you want your players to act within a certain set of constraints, tell them about it and ask for suggestions on how to make their character act that way. Railroading players is like herding cats - make it clear you want them to go somewhere, they'll go in the opposite direction.<br/><br/>2. Don't describe intricate mechanisms to any D&amp;D party with a Rogue and expect them to ignore it.<br/><br/>In my defense, the main reason I asked the player how his character would go about disarming the trap was because since I didn't think of it as a trap to begin with, I wanted to see if the player could come up with a reasonable way to "trapify it", and set the DC thereafter. So a follow-up question:<br/><br/>Assume the party has fallen into a waste pit, barely escaped the slicing blades with their lives, and killed the trash-mulching worms. You decide they're not home free yet, and tell them the walls are closing in on them as the magical trash compactor tries to finish the job. Having read an article or two about GMing advice, you decide you're not going to say anything more about it, and instead wait for the players to start brainstorming on how to get out. Not having a solution in mind, and allowing the players to come up with their own ideas for solving the problem, is a pretty tried and true empowering technique, no?<br/><br/>So let's say that the players look back at you in befuddlement, having no ideas (or no inclinations) to solve the problem. Finally the Rogue says "I want to disarm the trap. What do I roll?"<br/><br/>Reactions?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray" title="James McMurray"><img alt="James McMurray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray">James McMurray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94672/#Comment_94672" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T09:57:28+00:00" title="September 11, 2007  9:57AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If the game is using trap disarming skills, I'd never put the PCs into an imminent death sitatuion at the hands of a trap i didn't know the DC of.

Because that's what the skill is for. Seriously, there are multiple sections in multiple 3.X publications where various authors describe alternatives to the Disable Device skill - pushing some boards over an exposed pit, plugging up holes that arrows might come out of, and so on. These are things you can just do if the circumstances and  a player's ingenuity are in accord. <br/><br/>The point of the Disable Device skill, or at least the stated intent of several authors, is to be what you roll precisely when you have no clue how something actually works. It's what you roll when you have to get past a crackling field of ancient magic that curses any non-vampire that passes by, and you don't happen to actually have a degree in Pretend Metaphysics. It's also what you roll when you want to sabotage a catapult to fail after two or three shots without actually having a working knowledge of medieval engineering and the stress tolerance of dried cow sinew.<br/><br/>Skills like Disable Device are there to make those details go away. If you don't want those details to go away, if you want players to describe complicated schemes of jamming gears and pouring acid down cracks, then you should probably turn Disable Device into something else. Maybe "Improve Odds" or something to help an otherwise unlikely plan work. Or maybe "MacGyver Tools," allowing you to supply needed components out of thin air to complete a plan.<br/><br/>Of course, at that point, you're at the mercy of your own knowledge of physics, chemistry, and engineering to adjudicate things.<br/><br/>Edit: one other thing. The players are staring blankly at you, right? Befuddlement and lack of engagement, right? So, guess what: maybe your awesome idea wasn't so awesome to the rest of the table. Happens to everyone. It seems to me that, in such a case, "roll a die and move on to the next awesome thing" may well be the best solution anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94682">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94682/#Comment_94682" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T10:24:51+00:00" title="September 11, 2007 10:24AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fun!<br/>In D&amp;D I\xe2\u20ac\u2122d say to the rogue your DC is 22; success means you defeat the mechanism in time to all get out safely.

If I understand you correctly, you think I'm saying "Roll the dice - it will give you fictional resources by which you can describe the correct way to resolve the situation". So to clarify, at no point have I actually been interested in doing what Jason calls "pull the right lever" puzzles where the DM determines who lives or dies based on their choice of Door <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>.<br/><br/>Rather, my insistence for players describing their characters' vector of approach is for descriptive purposes - my intuitive reaction is that I want to hear "I dig around in the trash, looking for some metal poles or something I can use to wedge the walls" before I give the DC15 difficulty level and tell them to roll.<br/><br/>Of course, I could also say "DC15" and if they succeed, <b>I</b> say "OK, you dig around in the trash, and find some metal poles by which to wedge the walls". I understand many people play like that. To me, it sounds overburdening to the DM and unsatisfying to the players - but I understand it's a matter of taste.<br/><br/>The subject line of this thread may play in if I decide to increase or decrease the DC based on what the player says, but I insist that players say <i>something</i> - especially if they're trying to subject a piece of the environment to the game rules, such as creating a disablable (&lt;-- new word) trap from a slab of granite attached to a rope, or a pickpocketable NPC from a list of weapons.<br/><br/>Another point here is - if players could solve problems simply by stating their character does something especially smart, such as "I plug the dart holes with the mummy gauze", then what point is there in being a Rogue?

But, um (at the risk of sounding like some party line guy).... System Does Matter. We've been over this issue about a metric bejillion times, and it's always the same. When everybody above is talking about getting on the same sheet of music about what play is about, this is precisely "Creative Agenda" from the "Big Theory." Precisely. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe fact that D&amp;D tends to cause this problem to arise stems not from it being a game that promotes incoherent play. It comes from people trying to use D&amp;D for... well, everything. Thinking that "system does not matter" in regards to this sort of thing. So, unsurprisingly, large numbers of games of D&amp;D (and other RPGs, such that they're forced to do things that they aren't really good for) end up with this problem. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me break this down more closely. Why did this "non-trap" exist in play? Mikael, why did you include this in the game? I can see two options:<br/>\n1) To be a challenge for the players to potentially overcome. <br/>\n2) To be a mechanism to move the plot forward. <br/>\n<br/>\nLet me put it this way... did you ever intend for them to be able to notice the "non-trap"? Did you give them a roll as they approached? More to the point, let's say that they did disarm the thing... what then? Does play stall out, as they're not forced to go forward? Or is it less suspensful because they have a place to run to now, whereas it wouldn't have been the case if they had not? <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not criticizing this choice, if it was your choice - plot devices are fine things. Just so long as players understand that you get to use plot devices. When playing with obstacles in play as "challenges" for the players to overcome using their tool, the PC, this can be confusing. It seems a lot like you're staking the deck against them, and making play go a particular rout, without giving them a chance for success. <br/>\n<br/>\nI mean it's a dichotomy that's impossible to bridge. No matter how much GM's want it to be the case, they can't have control of plot, and simultaneously allow player ability to "win" if it will then give the players control of plot. You can't both control the outcomes at the same time. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, even further, let's say that you did intend it as a challenge. Was the challenge that the player had to say, "I'm looking for traps?" when they came to the mouth opening? Because, if it is, down that road lies madness. This is the sort of thing that gets players of the party thief to announce, "I'm tapping the floor with my ten foot pole" every time they turn down a new corridor. You really don't want this. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis falls into a category of player challenge that's bad for play. This is a recognized element of board-game design, for instance. Another example is "hidden trackable" information. This is information that is tracked, but done so out of sight of the players... but in a way that they can watch the tracking, and duplicate it if they want. This forces players either to have to try to do this tracking by guesswork - in which case failure makes them want to do the actual tracking. Or they have to track. Which any fool can do, and is not fun. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlaying so that you require the players to always say, "I search for traps" every ten feet of dungeon corridor is even worse than hidden trackable play. It doesn't prove the prowess of the player (perhaps dogged determination), so doing so successfully is not a reward. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo fix this, do one of two things. Automatically allow such characters a chance to notice every trap. Or make it into a reasonable challenge somehow. The first has the problem that you're taking away the player challenge - if anything, the challenge becomes simply building the right character before the dungeon. The second can be accomplished through any number of means. For instance you could have a "will" resource that the character has to burn in order to be "watchful" in a given room or corridor. This is actually a pretty realistic mechanic, as people become exhausted by being constantly vigilant. In this case it becomes a resource management task and judgment about threat level to decide when the theif uses his abilities. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, to recap all of this:<br/>\n1)Yeah, it's best if everyone is on the same sheet of music, I'd agree. Laws would tell you that you should try to satisfy each sort of player, but the example given is proof that this is problematic. If you give in to the one player, will the others be satisfied with the play overall? <br/>\n2)To enable getting on the same sheet of music, pick a system that supports well what you want to do, and then do just that. If you want to do a dungeon crawl, do a damn dungeon crawl. As the RPGA guy said to me at Origins this year as we headed into the dungeon, "There will be no roleplaying!"<br/>\n3)If you actually intend to play challenge-based play, do not initiate task resolution in such a way as to require constant announcement of intent to discover or fix things. Either allow it automatically, or come up with some further mechanics to make the question of when to do these things a tactially interesting one. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94764/#Comment_94764" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T12:55:09+00:00" title="September 11, 2007 12:55PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2007 1:00PM by Eric.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>Eric, what you're describing sounds like the opposite of what I was trying to say. If I understand you correctly, you think I'm saying "Roll the dice - it will give you fictional resources by which you can describe the correct way to resolve the situation". So to clarify, at no point have I actually been interested in doing what Jason calls "pull the right lever" puzzles where the DM determines who lives or dies based on their choice of Door <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>.<br/><br/>Rather, my insistence for players describing their characters' vector of approach is for descriptive purposes - my intuitive reaction is that I want to hear "I dig around in the trash, looking for some metal poles or something I can use to wedge the walls" before I give the DC15 difficulty level and tell them to roll.</blockquote>\nOkay, question for you, then:<br/><br/>In the second scenario, with the waste pit and what have you, the Rogue says, "okay, I totally ninja flip up and smack the secret weak spot Fonzie-style." <br/><br/>That's providing description, but nothing that an engineer could use. Is that enough to satisfy "the players must say something?" If it is, then right, I follow your opinion: the players need to contribute something to the story before rolling the dice, and that something doesn't have to involve blueprints or engineering or even be sane (though it'd be nice if it was thematically appropriate) - it just needs to move the shared fiction along somehow.<br/><br/>Edit: as Mike said, yeah, there's still the basic functional question of why you want them to narrate actions at all. It seems like it's not a Mother-May-I hoop to jump through, but it should be stated clearly.

Back on RPGNet, there's been more than one fight on the issue of player performance in the system:<br/><br/>Gamer: The game says that it's realistic. Here's the problem, though: My WARRIOR knows how to fight. I, the player, do not. However, the game makes ME, the player, fight. I suck at fighting, but my player is great at it. Therefore, this is a problem with the game: It makes the combat system dependent on the player's skills at manipulating the system.<br/><br/>My Standard Response: That's simply what you have to be on board with when you play the game. TROS is fast, it's a little complicated, it's brutal, and it's gamey. If you're up for the challenge, you can surely have a lot of fun with it. Also, you can (not suggested in the book, mind you) either boost up your player stats or lower the enemy stats at the beginning, to give you and the other players time to "slip into" the game and understand it. That's just the baggage you have to accept if you want to play an otherwise enjoyable game.<br/><br/>That's the thing, IMO: Player performance is just baggage that you have to accept, otherwise you'll be (to jump to the end of the slippery slope) playing hippy Norway Jeepform live-action games where you're character is only capable of doing what you can physically do, or perhaps a laid back wineglass-and-sofa storytelling game with no rules.  <br/><br/>I guess the idea is to find a game where that "baggage" is:<br/><br/>1) Fun (see BW lifepath/scripting, TROS combat, etc)<br/>2) In places where you don't mind it, or notice it.<br/>3) And, in either case, where everyone in the group is ok with that baggage. If one person just hates how in D&amp;D you can calculate HP loss then jump off a 400 foot high cliff, and can't get over it, then you'll have problems down the line.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad" title="Caesar Slaad"><img alt="Caesar Slaad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad">Caesar Slaad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94813/#Comment_94813" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T14:12:00+00:00" title="September 11, 2007  2:12PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jzn</cite>Mike, your argument is that if you play D&amp;D, you are best off playing it as what it is built to do.

That took some real discipline. And, for what it's worth, where people might be saying that using D&amp;D for something else is bad, I agree with you that this is a BS argument. We could talk about support, but what System Does Matter says foremost is that if you're having a good time, you're doing the right thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlan, you've just fallen into one of the standard 7 myths about System Does Matter, which says that SDM says that people don't matter. Or that setting doesn't matter. System Does Matter doesn't say any of that, only that "the System Doesn't Matter, because only people matter" or somesuch is wrong. Heck, we could have a discussion about which is more important, and still not be disagreeing with SDM at all. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy example was, perhaps, badly chosen. But what I was trying to convey is that gamism isn't bad, but it's good to stick to it if that's the direction you're going. The RPGA event in question was quite entertaining (we won prizes, too!). But that's certainly not the only entertaining way to play D&amp;D. It's just an example of one which worked very well,because the creative agenda was very clear: discover if you can kick ass on this dungeon. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat's bad is using a system in such a way as to simultaneously say that play is about player challenge, but then to take that challenge away in the name of story. You're saying to the player, subtextually, "We're going to see if you can kick ass on the dungeon... but not really since I'm going to force the results to come out the way I want so that we can get to the end of the story." This is what, in effect, Mikael has admitted was said to the players. Now, here's the thing... Mikael never actually did anything himself to "say" what I quote above. He's actually only saying the second clause. The first clause is being said by the system. The system is informing the players that, hey, I have a skill to disarm traps, and, like all my abilties to kill things on my sheet, I have this skill to have it be tested in play. So if/when I see something that looks like a trap, I'll expect that I get to use this ability. And when successful, I can feel proud at having created a character who fills this role in making the party successful. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I say this at the risk of people misinterpreting it again. This is not to say that you can't play D&amp;D with plot devices. You just have to be very careful how you do it, and hope that you're communicating to the players when it's happening, and that they buy into this mode of play. Because the system won't be helping you get this idea across. It's a fine, wonderful way to play D&amp;D, if you can get it to work. It's just that getting everyone on the same sheet of music may take a little more effort than if you used another system. On the other hand, you may have a group for which it's no extra effort at all. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere's the thing: people in the past have blamed the player in the example for being a bad player, because he's trying to "game" the system or something. Well, he's just confused about what the creative agenda is with the rest of the group. He's not a bad player, he's just interpreting the signals he's getting from the system in such a way as to not be on board with what everyone else is doing. This can be corrected several different ways - including "just" communicating. Or even, possibly, by switching your play to how he plays. He's not wrong. He's just not playing the same game you are. And that's just because RPGs are complex beasts. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, to get back on track for the thread, the point is that the question of whether or not the play should have included the player demanding to not be required to have "roleplayed" finding the trap before entering the cave, is answered by answering the question about what creative agenda was being demanded to be followed. In fact, odd though it may seem, the more gamey agenda doesn't work well with "roleplaying" these parts, for the reasons that I enumerated above. The desire to see this played out is, as somebody (Mikael?) pointed out, about wanting to explore this part of the character in action. It works better, if, for example, the player isn't concerned with "winning" and is instead content to have his character fail to explore that. Again, just as an example, not definitively. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, again, the question of whether or not player performance should be considered here comes down to some complex slices of the creative agenda sought by those playing. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad" title="Caesar Slaad"><img alt="Caesar Slaad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad">Caesar Slaad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94985/#Comment_94985" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T06:48:41+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  6:48AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Alan, you've just fallen into one of the standard 7 myths about System Does Matter,</blockquote>\nOh have I?\n<blockquote>which says that SDM says that people don't matter.
