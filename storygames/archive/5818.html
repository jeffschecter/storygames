The games are short.  <br/>2.  Individual blocks of text are short and no-frills.<br/>3.  Simple rules.  This makes them easy to grok.<br/>4.  Cool powers.<br/>5.  Plays in a short amount of time.<br/><br/>Easy to pick up, easy to read, easy to grok, easy to like, easy to organize.<br/><br/>Anyone else have insights on why these games get so much play?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130136/#Comment_130136" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-25T07:13:38+00:00" title="February 25, 2008  7:13AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think all of your points are good ones that contribute. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso I think that familiarity with, or even nostalgia for, D&amp;D makes Red Box Hack approachable for many. The jaded might even say its just a counter-revolutionary impetus with D&amp;D-based games.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, honestly, we can only speculate. If we knew precisely what it was that caused a game to become (relatively) popular, then we'd all be doing that. I think that to some extent that a lot of it comes down somewhat to the random nature of that ill-defined beast we sometimes call "Buzz." Which is that basically somebody tries the game, and becomes a spout for talking about it a lot, which spawns more talk, and more play in return. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt's not enough that a designer talk a lot about his own game - the reader will assume bias. It has to be somebody outside of the designers immediate influence. So it's completely hit and miss. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll you can say is "Create a game that you think that somebody other than yourself will like." Then pray that you were right. As a designer of a game, you are, and always will be, too close to the game to objectively understand whether or not it will appeal to anybody other than yourself. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a connundrum. Because it's really not easy to design games for somebody else. I don't really advocate it. What you have to do is design the game you like, because that will be the best designed game you can write. And then you just have to hope that you are not so different from others that there aren't a few who will appreciate it for many of the same reasons that you appreciate your design. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf they do, they'll play, post good things about the game, then others will pick up on it. Nothing, but nothing gets people playing like people playing, and talking about it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn another point, just what is "critical mass?" How many people have to play and report in a given amount of time to meet your criteria? I'd say that it's healtier not to expect a certain amount of play, but instead to understand your design after the fact as a product that's going to get X amount of play. <br/>\n<br/>\nOtherwise you fall into the trap of mainstream games, in trying to figure out what appeals to the masses. The problem being that the Masses area already satisfied with D&amp;D. You want to make the most money that you can in RPGs, by selling the most RPG books? Then do as Peter Adkison did, and buy D&amp;D. <br/>\n<br/>\nOutside of that, I'm afraid you're going to have to be satisfied with getting precisely as many people to play as your niche appeals to greatly. Which may be very, very few. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome people call this defeatist talk, and say that I'll never be successful if I keep this attitude. Except that I already feel successful... and none of them have EVER been able to overcome the inertia of D&amp;D. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nConsider, too, now that D&amp;D has been supplantedn and surpassed by World of Warcraft. Which does D&amp;D better than D&amp;D ever did (Gary should sue)! If you want vast commercial success, you're competing against juggernaughts that can only be defeated by creating a better knock off of their model. Hell, the MMORPG culture has it's own distinct language from RPG now (like the term "mob," which most players don't know is shorthand for "Mobile object"). <br/>\n<br/>\nIn that context, I think it's better to define success as "people having fun playing my game." Which takes just one group. If more than that play, then great!<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a perspective. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130147/#Comment_130147" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-25T08:14:18+00:00" title="February 25, 2008  8:14AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>If more than that play, then great!</blockquote>Well, IMO people playing is more than great.  If you have any kind of iterative design process, play beyond you is key to finishing the game... I think some of this is being faced by those who aren't receiving feedback on the ashcan front.  <br/><br/>I think you're right that scratching a nostalgic itch is also a good idea for the games, but I'm not sure that the buzz is that random, or outside of what people could design for. <br/><br/>Then again... if everyone was doing it, maybe it wouldnt' work anymore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130152/#Comment_130152" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-25T08:21:15+00:00" title="February 25, 2008  8:21AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So I think you can<br/><br/>Design a game for what you want to see<br/>but keep it short<br/>make each block of text short and no-frills<br/>have simple rules that are explained clearly<br/>if possible, make the cool stuff obvious<br/>make a game that plays in a short amount of time.<br/><br/>I'd say that last point could probably be expanded to "plays to the best parts in a short amount of time" because it's not OK if sessions are an hour long but it takes 25 of them to get to the awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130155/#Comment_130155" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-25T08:25:14+00:00" title="February 25, 2008  8:25AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd add:<br/><br/>Make it free<br/>Make it easy to find<br/>Make it open to modification <br/><br/>I did all that with <i>Dungeon Squad</i> and other people are actively fixing the game's problems as they make it their own, which is amazing to watch.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/twilight" title="twilight"><img alt="twilight" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/twilight">twilight</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130164/#Comment_130164" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-25T08:39:10+00:00" title="February 25, 2008  8:39AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would also add that, if you were looking specifically to create a popular game, that the designer would have to know the gaming trends. Though I haven't played <i>Dungeon Squad</i>, I think <i>Red Box Hack</i> garnered the most activity, I think, at the cusp of the transition from 3.5 to 4.0. Effectively, it came at the time when D&amp;D; was in its greatest flux - players were looking at staying 3.5 or waiting for 4.0. To bide their time, alternatives were looked at, i.e. <i>Microlite20</i>, <i>Red Box Hack</i> and the like. Because some players don't want to buy more 3.5 in the event they <i>do</i> decide to move up to 4.0. So it'd effectively require a psychohistorian to guarantee hitting that trend if the goal is to create a popular game from the outset.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antoine_F" title="Antoine_F"><img alt="Antoine_F" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antoine_F">Antoine_F</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130413/#Comment_130413" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-26T01:27:10+00:00" title="February 26, 2008  1:27AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry,<br/><br/>I don't realy know Dungeon Squad and I don't know if it falls within the scope of what I want to say, but did someone mention that there are very few good and not centered around parody gamist designs that emerged from the indie scene until recently ?<br/><br/>More precisely fantasy gamist design.

Every free game that I've designed specifically to play to the perceived demands of others has gone largely (if not entirely) unnoticed. Stuff that I designed primarily for <i>me</i> (e.g., vs. Elves, Core Elements, Scales, Window Frame, and Kumquat Tattoo) garnered a fair amount of attention in various online communities. I think this is because I truly enjoy designing stuff for me, while designing stuff for other people always feels like a real chore. <br/><br/>I think that this shows in the writing. Likewise, I think my enthusiasm for the stuff that I originally designed fro me shows in the writing. More importantly, I think enthusiastic writing is contagious, as is lack of enthusiasm. It seems that many of the games which make a bigg-ish splash are those that the creators themselves are enthusiastic about, while many of those that bomb are those that the creator rarely mentions or can't garner much public enthusiasm for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_132008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh" title="jdrakeh"><img alt="jdrakeh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/909/nZA3BEK4G6OHW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh">jdrakeh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132008/#Comment_132008" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-02T23:01:06+00:00" title="March  2, 2008 11:01PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Cerebrality?<br/><br/>But I won't argue.

To be clear, it wasnt't the scene editing, the division of narrative control, or any of those things that put me (or my play group at the time) off of Donjon. It was the way you rolled and read dice. It wasn't intuitive at all, and the whole 'fistful of d20s' bit seemed to further complicate things in pursuit of an unfunny joke rather than any kind of mechanical payoff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132009/#Comment_132009" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-02T23:54:49+00:00" title="March  2, 2008 11:54PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It is completely impossible for me not to pimp my game in a thread that mentions both Dungeon Squad and Donjon.<br/><br/>It's still a playtest document, but I've been playing and enjoying it for a number of months.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.rpgbakery.com/forum/comments.php?DiscussionID=23&amp;page=1#Item_8" rel="nofollow">Savage Donjon Squad</a> - to be renamed soon!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_132306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132306/#Comment_132306" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-04T10:12:01+00:00" title="March  4, 2008 10:12AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Melinglor</cite>By the way, is there any way to buy a print copy of Donjon anywhere?

(I didn't print from web because of that annoying TOC sidebar that eats paper.)<br/><br/>If Clinton slapped it into a clean, digest format--maybe with some cool art from Storn!--I'd be buying it on Day One. In fact, Donjon, RBH, DitV, and Universalis have all inspired me to make ASCII <a href="/forums/profile/HACK">@HACK</a>, a "Traits"-based roguelike game simulator with one Adventurer and everyone else Adversaries. And it *will* be available at Lulu before too much longer--I'd like to take it on the convention tour, this year (I had planned to be done for StellarCon; now, it will likely be more of a playtest than a true demo, if I go with it).<br/><br/>Oh, and on-topic: con demos make buzz. Free copies at con demos make home games. Home games make buzz. Not to be a Heretic, but I've rarely found AP to be a strong motivator for buying. I, at least, am more motivated to buy according what I see happening in the rules, the presentation, evocative art and text, and premise/genre. Oh, and I'm a sucker for skinable/hackable games, too, so I can get more bang for my systemic buck. So make it well, make it pretty, and "aim me" at the target, and I jump on board. Free? Irrelevant. Short? Not necessarily (*ahem* Hero Fifth Edition, and Burning Empires). No-frills? Bullshit--I pay for frills as much as for easily referenced specifics of rules. Short play time? Helps for demoing and to quickly show the "grabby bits," but not in any way key, in my mind. In fact, the extended nature of campaign play is far more important to me, in a game (probably my only "issue" with DitV: I can't keep up a head of Mormon steam for more than a handful of session, then I want to drift). I'd, in fact, prefer "scalability" to "plays fast": you CAN whip out a sweaty quickie during lunch, or you can settle in for a long, languorous screw--uh, game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132336/#Comment_132336" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-04T11:17:55+00:00" title="March  4, 2008 11:17AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric Provost</cite>Also, it's worth noting that if there had been no Agon there would have been no RBH.
