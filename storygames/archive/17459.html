However, this sets precedents presumed to be accepted by players later as the basis for invoking "units of control" later<br/><br/>- What's lame <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>?<br/>Any time a confusing situation arises that seems to be in some kind of grey area between "units of control" and the ad-hoc control.<br/><br/>Scenario A, GM ad-hoc is OK and sets precedent<br/>GM: "The blackrock goblin clan controls the routes between the northwestern towns.  You'll find lots of danger if you travel there, and supplies may be sparse."<br/><b>[The players explore the area between the towns and randomly encounter a monster that is too dangerous for them to slay. They run away after losing one of their horses]</b><br/><br/>Scenario B, GM ad-hoc is spontaneous and could be lame<br/>Player: "I want to go to the store and buy a crossbow."<br/>GM: "You won't find a crossbow there, the blackrock goblin clan controls the routes between this and the next town, so shipments don't always make it."<br/>Player: "That sucks, I can't even try?"<br/><br/>(Now, let's fix it in the spirit of the OP:)<br/><br/>GM: "Okay wait, yeah that's lame.  Let's roll for it, but I'm going to add a -5 penalty due to the blackrock clan raids"<br/><br/>What sticks out to me is that when a game text ONLY defines dice rolls for players using text that's within the context of the fiction (i.e. "Make a skill/ability roll whenever something your character tries to do is in question") no obvious solutions to this grey area are in the text.  One may be led to think "Well it's not about the character's skill, so I guess we don't roll anything"<br/><br/>What are some other lame scenarios that arise concerning GM control, and ways to fix them in this same spirit?<br/><br/>-- John M.<br/><br/>* - Starring the non-obvious one.  I considered this an example since in the past, GMs have used their ability to design encounters as a way to railroad when other methods were more clearly unfair.  Not to say  there can't be monsters that are way outside the player level range when a precedent has been fairly set ahead of time.  I guess if anyone comes in to discuss, the concept of setting fictional precedent for future rulings would be a big part of this discussion.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395450/#Comment_395450" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-30T15:42:52+00:00" title="October 30, 2012  3:42PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I expected this to be another <i>Tremulus</i> thread!

When a GM creates fiction about the setting/situation, it can impact the PCs in ways he might not predict; I've been in that position.  One response is a lazy GM shrugs and says, "Sorry, this is what happened, I promise I didn't mean for it to block you" feeling it's his duty to be true to the fiction he created. I think a better response would be to roll some dice. A lot of GMs use this process anyway, so I see no reason this can't be codified into system.<br/><br/>Buying a crossbow isn't the best example.

I'm reading this two ways.  Please tell me which is correct!<br/><br/>1) A roll with a heavy penalty is needless interference with the fun of having a crossbow.  The GM ought to just say, "If it's important to you, you find a crossbow in the store."<br/><br/>2) A roll with a heavy penalty is perfectly acceptable, as there are valid reasons for the GM to not just give the players a crossbow.<br/><br/>Separately, I'm still not following you on why a player who wants a crossbow should be less annoyed at "you have to make a roll with poor odds; oh look, you failed" than at a simple "no".  My gaming history has seen just as many "I shouldn't have had to roll" or "that target number was too high" arguments as "why'd you say no?" arguments.<br/><br/>Getting rid of those arguments, in my experience, has been all about distilling the resolution process down to something <i>consistent</i> and <i>predictable</i>, so I know which actions I'll have to roll for even before I attempt them.  If the GM <i>might</i> ask me to roll for the crossbow, I don't think we've gotten anywhere.<br/><br/>Do you have a vision for communicating "when we roll, and for what"?<br/><br/>(Random tangent: when I'm GMing, my desire for my blockade to matter and your desire for a crossbow don't have to wind up either/or.  If you get <i>the last crossbow in town</i> and the townsfolk make a big deal about it and how their land was flowing with crossbows before the blockade, then I think we both get what we want.

The only walling that matters is when someone got excited over a certain outcome that happens to be walled. All the outcomes that no one cares about that are walled obviously aren't an issue.<br/><br/>Further, even if you get a roll and it's like a 20% chance, then there's an 80% chance it'll be the same as the GM staying true to his fiction. If you don't like that then there's an 80% chance of what you don't like happening. That's not really a solution.<br/><br/>I think it'd be better to look at what your goal is for a session, or in a multi session campaign, what your goal is for the campaign. And how much the GM can or can't block that.<br/><br/>Really if your goal is to just get a crossbow, then you probably have a GM focused on some kind of scenario, while the player is just interested in the crossbow. Neither is really participating in each others focus.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395651/#Comment_395651" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-31T19:56:35+00:00" title="October 31, 2012  7:56PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Big_J_Money,<br/><br/>There are a bunch of systems out there (like "the Pool") which allow a very easy way to handle this kind of thing: don't allow the GM to set the difficulty of rolls. In the Pool, it's the player who decides how many dice to roll (thereby setting the difficulty themselves, as they wish). In some other games, it might be the whole group that judges. For instance, there is a base difficulty number, and then each player can adjust it by +1 or -1, as they think best describes the situation.<br/><br/>This kind of thing can be handled differently, also, if the difficulty of the roll is not supposed to describe the fictional situation (e.g. like in the Pool). Then you have all sorts of options. <br/><br/>But I'm not even sure if this what you're looking for, so I'll step back and keep reading.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walterman" title="walterman"><img alt="walterman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walterman">walterman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395677/#Comment_395677" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-01T05:31:36+00:00" title="November  1, 2012  5:31AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 1, 2012 5:32AM by walterman.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It is lame to say there are no crossbows in town or that a single die roll with bad odds entirely set by GM fiat.

I realized this morning the nature of the player's motive is more important than I gave credit for and it bears mention so the thread doesn't get confusing. Maybe it should have been included in the examples.<br/><br/>Example: The player wants a crossbow. He wants to remove the heads, melt down silver to make new silver heads, and then replace them on the bolts to fight the werewolf menacing town.<br/><br/>In that case, yes, it's still important for a GM to dig to find intent.  You still do the roll with bad odds (read on), but then upon failure leave a path that leads to an alternative. <br/><br/>This isn't what the thread is about, but it's so related that I want to thank people for calling it out. It's a fantastic match for the style of GMing I'm assuming with this thread. I'd like to point out that you can look for a player's intent regardless of whether you rolled dice or simply said "No, but...". This is why I say it's not what the thread is about.<br/><br/>-------<br/><br/>Back to the purpose.  There are games designed around the idea of characters being challenged by a world that's worked out logistically through nothing more than percentages of receptivity vs blockage to their attempts to shape it.  I play with players who want that; they want the sharp edges of the world to bump up against them and poke every once and a while to remind them that it "feels real".<br/><br/>I don't believe rule-0 accomplishes this play goal*, but when a player agrees that a dice modifier matches the given fiction, they've bought into the plausibility of the result (again, talking about myself and players I've played with).  <br/><br/>The reason these are called units of control is because it's control over the specificity of this fictional result now, as interpreted by things that have come before.  It doesn't care about player motivations (but the GM of course does, which is why he has the creative flexibility mentioned above). In a way, it's not really GM control, it's "game text control".  I think I posed this thread as GM control because that's how rule-0 is often used, and that's what this is supposed to replace.  <br/><br/>I have one more way of framing it.  What matters here is the dice roll with a potentially small chance of success.  The GM could say "No, but", but instead he laughs an evil laugh and says "Remember about the goblin raids?  You're searching the the shopkeeper's inventory and coming up very bare on supplies. [rolls dice to see if a crossbow is there]"  These extra rolls make the world seem like its pressing against the player.  It makes an issue out of something that you might otherwise not make an issue about.  For a moment, the player is a little tense because there <i>might</i> be the crossbow they need. If the roll comes up a failure, then they might reluctantly decide to rough the shopkeeper up a bit to find out who in town would actually have one.  The goblin raids are making everyone act like beasts.<br/><br/>In short: the dice roll is the world reminding the GM how mean (or merciful) it can be.  Sure, the GM can ad-hoc something that follows intent and keep things fun, but this extra step is for those who dig it (I was thinking also a good way to open the door for people who aren't used to things like player intent? Maybe not, though). It would be neat if I find a way to formalize this into an actual rule where players call for the GM to make rolls.<br/><br/>I understand there are players who don't care about the specificity of the fiction or being challenged by the simulation of a harsh environment, so this thread might be fruitless to some, I guess.<br/><br/>* -- At best, rule-0 can force the game along when a table is split down the middle about interpreting the fiction through a ruling, and someone has to break a tie. But then, I wouldn't implement a rule-0, I would simply say the GM is responsible for breaking ties :-/<br/><br/>Edit: I reread the thread and realized that I really muddied things with my first reply.

I'll admit I am able to follow examples WAY MORE BETTER then wordy theory jargon, so bare with me. What's got me puzzled, and correct me if I'm wrong please, but it sounds like some people would be upset in this situation if they wanted a crossbow and the DM ruled that there were none available in the shops, regardless of what made sense given the fiction determined before hand. Again, I like examples a lot, so here's an example:<br/><br/><i>The players receive a quest in Big City to travel to Little Town a week's travel away and investigate the goblin raids that have been attacking Rich Merchant's supply caravans. Rich Merchant explains that his company is the only one that supplies the general store in Little Town, but his caravans have been attacked and destroyed for the past few months. The GM then further clarifies the implicit challenge by stating that the players should expect supplies to be seriously limited when they arrive in Little Town, given the raids. (Fair warning to stock up on gear before leaving Big City, without it be stated blatantly.)<br/><br/>The players leave Big City, travel a week to Little Town, but right before they arrive, they are attacked by the goblin raiders. They defeat the goblins and Level Up. One of the players buys a new Crossbow Skill. Afterwards, they get to Little Town and go to the general store to buy a crossbow, but alas, as the GM suggested, the shelves are bare!<br/></i><br/>Now - in this example, I don't think it's unfair for the player to find a lack of crossbows, given the fact that all the established fiction stated the general store hasn't been stocked in months. Would you, as a player, be upset? I mean, I'd be disappointed, but I wouldn't cry foul and say "fuck the cheatin' ass GM." <br/><br/>Now, as the GM in this example, I wouldn't say "Oh okay, fine you find one." since that kind of negates the established fiction that I purposely made clear beforehand as a meaningful challenge element to this mission. To me, that's the same thing as saying, "Oh okay, the goblin raiders don't attack you since you guys aren't prepared for an ambush." I mean, at some point, the challenges presented by the GM need to have some significance, whether the challenge is an ambush or a lack of supplies, right?<br/><br/>I would however offer alternatives in the crossbow situation, such as finding a local owner who is willing to sell, traveling back to Big City to buy one, or even hiring a runner to go to Big City and bring one back for you. In all of these alternatives, buying a crossbow would be more expensive - the owner would charge more given supply and demand, the travel back to Big City would cost money, or the runner would charge a fee for the trip, maybe even a big fee given the established danger on the roads.  In other words, as a GM, I don't want to block the players arbitrarily, but I don't want to be a push-over either. I'm a fan of my players, but I'm not there to make it a walk in the park. Is that dysfunctional on my part?<br/><br/>I also really like the idea of allowing the player to spend an Awesome Point or something to bring some good fortune - maybe the shop keeper knows of someone who has a crossbow that owes him money, suggesting that they speak with that person and offer to pay their debt in exchange for the crossbow. The spending of that Awesome Point saves them the time of finding the owner of the crossbow on their own, and also gives them leverage so as not to get gouged on the price (they might even be able to get it cheaper given said leverage!). I personally feel, as both a GM and a Player, that spending that Awesome Point should give the player a favorable fictional route to the goal, as opposed to forcing a roll with a chance to retcon the fiction in my favor. To state it differently, I'd rather my Awesome Point force the GM to provide a new favorable opportunity to get what I want, rather then just force the GM to let me roll dice to determine if the shop has a crossbow after all, thereby negating the fictional challenge pre-established by the GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395718/#Comment_395718" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-01T11:41:29+00:00" title="November  1, 2012 11:41AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            About solving the "can or can't I get a crossbow" thing through rolling dice: I feel obliged here to paraphrase Ron Edwards (I don't even remember where or when he said it) and point out that <b>if you only roll for it once in a lifetime, the percentages don't matter \u2014 only the actual outcome does</b>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395739/#Comment_395739" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-01T13:01:25+00:00" title="November  1, 2012  1:01PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 1, 2012 1:02PM by Zachary_Wolf.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><b>if you only roll for it once in a lifetime, the percentages don't matter \u2014 only the actual outcome does</b>.</blockquote>\nIf I'm rolling once in a lifetime to win a billion dollars, the percentages matter.

Or is just that they matter less than the outcome, because the outcome is what you'll remember?\n<blockquote>That's why negotiating arbitrary percentages at the table, such as the chance to find a crossbow despite the blockade, is generally a waste of time \u2014 unless the <i>actual</i> point of it is to discourage an attempt, or encourage it, and so on. If you're genuinely interested in making such outcomes uncertain, though, and that's all there is to it, then going with a fixed 50-50 roll (or whatever) is fine.</blockquote>\nThis I kind of agree with. But I think it really depends on the precedents that are set. If the players arrive in town and ask for a crossbow, they should get one, unless somewhere it was pre-established that supplies are not available in that town. In my example above, the GM straight up said supplies would be limited in Small Town, so in this case I wouldn't be surprised as a player to show up and find no crossbow, or find that I have to work extra or pay extra to get a hold of one.<br/><br/>I think the problem is when the players arrive in the town, with no precedents set yet, and say I want a crossbow. If the GM, for some reason, doesn't want to give the player a crossbow and retroactively claims the reason is because of a blockade, that's shitty GMing - period. If the fiction was set beforehand that supplies would be limited, no crossbow should be expected. If for some reason, there is just a chance to find a crossbow (maybe the player is looking for a magical crossbow?), then a 50-50 roll should work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walterman" title="walterman"><img alt="walterman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walterman">walterman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395778/#Comment_395778" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-01T17:38:20+00:00" title="November  1, 2012  5:38PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A game with a written jam percentage is like a game with economic rules that clearly say the percentage of crossbow purchasing in a town in a given area complete with modifiers for goblin's closing the trade routes.<br/><br/>If I understand the question, it is about keeping the "reality" of the game world working when there aren't clear jam or goblin's closing trade route tables.<br/><br/>The options seem to be player fiat (the gun jams when a player says it does), GM fiat or a dice roll.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395800/#Comment_395800" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-01T20:06:24+00:00" title="November  1, 2012  8:06PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 1, 2012 8:08PM by Emily_Care.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are at least three things at work here that I see:<br/><br/><b>Conflict of Interest</b>\n<blockquote>Scenario B, GM ad-hoc is spontaneous and could be lame<br/>Player: "I want to go to the store and buy a crossbow."<br/>GM: "You won't find a crossbow there, the blackrock goblin clan controls the routes between this and the next town, so shipments don't always make it."<br/>Player: "That sucks, I can't even try?"</blockquote>\nThe players could be right to be suspect. The GM has resources they don't have access to, and is in charge of meting out their access to effectiveness. That crossbow might be any of the things that David and Rafu mention, but one major thing it is, is a unit of effectiveness. There is a potential conflict of interest in having the GM decide when you get it. Or determining what level of threat you face as in the other example. There are different ways to deal with this. Using chance is one. Also, establishing guidelines and even a culture of how to negotiate differences is another way. Freeform and larp do this much more than tabletop. <br/><br/><b>Weighted Rolls to Gain Concensus</b>\n<blockquote>Separately, I'm still not following you on why a player who wants a crossbow should be less annoyed at "you have to make a roll with poor odds; oh look, you failed" than at a simple "no". My gaming history has seen just as many "I shouldn't have had to roll" or "that target number was too high" arguments as "why'd you say no?" arguments.</blockquote>\nOne of the things that chance does is that it eases tensions people can have about unequal distribution of resources. An example from a class I took on social conflict over natural resources was hunting rights. Say there are a limited number of them, less than the number of people who want to get a license to hunt. Giving them out one at a time can cause problems: people may think there is a political reason why someone gets instead of them. First come first serve may leave some people angry at not being able to go during business hours etc. So some state hold a drawing. Everyone has until such and such a day to put their name in, then the allotted number are chosen. Charter schools often use the same process. The reason is that psychologically, it feels more fair. It may not be particularly more fair than the first-come-first serve option, though it may be much more fair than an option that is open to political influence. But people will accept that everyone had the same chance, and it eases tensions. Usually. <br/><br/>Dice and chance in games can serve the same function. That's what the initial example says to me:<br/><br/><b>Establishing/Fictional Positioning</b>\n<blockquote><br/>- What's a unit?<br/>Something the rules text that affects a dice roll (or other fortune rule)<br/>Example: Add +2 or +5 to a DC, set a DC to a familiar level (15, 20 or 25)<br/>Example*: Modify a monster by +/- 2 from the 'standard difficulty' compared to players' levels<br/><br/>- What else can the GM do?<br/>The GM ad-hoc controls areas of the fiction that don't affect the players NOW.  However, this sets precedents presumed to be accepted by players later as the basis for invoking "units of control" later<br/><br/>- What's lame <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>?<br/>Any time a confusing situation arises that seems to be in some kind of grey area between "units of control" and the ad-hoc control.<br/></blockquote>\n David addresses the establishing of precedent in his rules of thumb to be consistent and predictable. The use of dice or weighting rolls to do so, is one tool to establish consistency and predictability.  These ease the tensions with perceived conflict of interest for the GM. It's tempting to say that the more autonomy and transparency there is in the system the less danger of this, but 3.5 vs. 4e could arguably have that difference, and there is a lot of disgruntlement about 4e. But that's a total side issue.\n<blockquote>This I kind of agree with. But I think it really depends on the precedents that are set. If the players arrive in town and ask for a crossbow, they should get one, unless somewhere it was pre-established that supplies are not available in that town. In my example above, the GM straight up said supplies would be limited in Small Town, so in this case I wouldn't be surprised as a player to show up and find no crossbow, or find that I have to work extra or pay extra to get a hold of one.<br/></blockquote>\nA great example of a GM establishing a consistent set of expectations via freeform fictional positioning.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395810/#Comment_395810" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-01T21:05:03+00:00" title="November  1, 2012  9:05PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems the opposite of running into the sharp edges of the world.<br/><br/>It seems like a secondary GM role, much reduced powers but having the power to turn a no from the GM into a roll and some haggle on the percentage chance.<br/><br/>Which is fine if you want players (or even just one other player apart from the GM) to have a minor GM role.<br/><br/>But not if you want to say your facing the sharp edges of the world.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395825/#Comment_395825" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-01T23:31:35+00:00" title="November  1, 2012 11:31PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Emily, I think 3.5 vs. 4E is totally relevant to this discussion, but *not* on the issue of transparency, rather, it's in looking at the way skill DCs are set in each system that we see the disconnect. In 3E you get skill DCs based on what's going on in the fiction; in 4E they're based on <i>what level you are</i>, i.e., a purely game-mechanical construct. Which also means your chances of succeeding are basically the same* at every level, which is DUUUUUUUUUUMB. But more importantly, it leads to just exactly what was talked about in this thread involving the crossbow: even if the GM gives you a chance to roll for it, the % seems arbitrary-because-disconnected-from-the-fiction.<br/><br/>Matt<br/><br/>*Yes, yes, I know there were Easy, Moderate, and Hard DCs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
