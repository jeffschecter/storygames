Need to think about people from beyond Montreal, who might enjoy a quick trip from either Ottawa, TO, Quebec City, New York, Vermont, &amp;c. My plan is to keep costs as low as possible. <br/><br/>Jason, any and all help is welcome. As a grad student, I have few resources in some areas but access to others. Initially, I had planned to host it in a warehouse / loft space that I have access to, gratis. That would be suitable for a game day or workshop size event, say thirty or forty people, maybe six or seven tables comfortably in the large hall. If we wanted to do a tight and intimate event - like a gaming and design retreat, it would work well I think. <br/><br/>Anything larger, I was thinking about booking through the university - this takes care of things like tables, chairs and rooms. I don't know what kind of cost it will be, but my experience at my previous university booking students events like this were free of charge. So, I expect it to be relatively low. I still need to contact their hospitality services.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P" title="Cedric P"><img alt="Cedric P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img39.imageshack.us/img39/7180/opticnerve8s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P">Cedric P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311584/#Comment_311584" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-07T22:03:46+00:00" title="February  7, 2011 10:03PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311621">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Pitre" title="Jason_Pitre"><img alt="Jason_Pitre" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/963/nF2ZB6ZWC4SFX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Pitre">Jason_Pitre</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311621/#Comment_311621" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-08T05:16:11+00:00" title="February  8, 2011  5:16AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My recommendation is to chat up Le Valet de Coeur and explain that you are trying to organize a con.

One concern would be that of parking space; would there be sufficient?   Kickstarter might be a bit of a pain since technically it has to be hooked up to a US bank account, but there are ways around that restriction.  <br/><br/>Oh, I recommend a that it last about a weekend in total.  Enough time for people to commute without breaking the bank while having it worth people's time.  I can also drag the somewhat limited story game playing/designing community in Ottawa down to Montreal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P" title="Cedric P"><img alt="Cedric P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img39.imageshack.us/img39/7180/opticnerve8s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P">Cedric P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311635/#Comment_311635" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-08T06:46:31+00:00" title="February  8, 2011  6:46AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Getting in touch with the people of Roludo who organize the Roludothons could also be a good initiative, some of them already have a good experience with organizing cons in Montr\xe9al and they can point toward resources &amp; peoples.

We just don't have the gaming population to support multiple events aimed at different subsets of the gaming world.  Roludo is very pro-story games.  The organizers (including myself) were instrumental in getting indie games on the table at past RoyalCons and Draconis and in getting our all-star guests up here last year.  So you will get a very warm welcome from them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille" title="Jocelyn Robitaille"><img alt="Jocelyn Robitaille" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille">Jocelyn Robitaille</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311712/#Comment_311712" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-08T11:59:13+00:00" title="February  8, 2011 11:59AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 8, 2011 12:28PM by Jocelyn Robitaille.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, great to see some talk of Roludo over here! (As you might know or might have guessed, I'm one of the Roludo founders, the major caretaker of the Roludothons, and one of the organizers of the Grand Roludothon.)<br/>\n<br/>\n@Orly...<br/>\n<br/>\n[RE: The Roludothons] While story games have not been the focus of the Roludothons, I gotta say they have been really well represented. Each time, there's been at least two story games on the schedule, and the diversity of player has been pretty great (i.e.: it wasn't the same 5 people sitting at the table for each event.)<br/>\n<br/>\n[RE: Organizing an event] The renting fees for the university, unless you're a student association, tend to be a bit pricey from what I can tell. A better bet would be the CEGEPs, where the classroom rent for 75,00$ per day, plus a fee for the security guard if you want to hold the event on the weekend and/or late into the night. If you want to hold the event during the summer, however, you're out of luck, and you're going to have to settle for a community center. Either way, for a first time event, my best advice would definitely be to go for that loft of yours. Until you know how many people will attend for sure, renting space is a financial risk. (Heck, even when you do know, it still is.)<br/>\n<br/>\n[RE: The underserved community] Yep, pretty much. This is actually a big part of why we created Roludo to begin with - and right now we're thriving. The community keeps growing and diversifying, and it's great. If you do get an event underway, be sure to come over and announce it on our forums - there's a good chance you'll get yourself a few more participants.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n@lumpley<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm glad to read that you remember Montreal fondly from Draconis. Walkerp (another of the Roludo founders) mentioned that you guys said you'd definitely be interested in coming back for another con, and we have definitely not forgotten about you. We're sorting out a few details, and then we had planned on e-mailing you guys about the Grand Roludothon.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n@The Story Games Community<br/>\n<br/>\nThis has yet to be announced officially (again, we're sorting out a couple of details before launching the event full force), but one thing we will do is allow communities to "present" a set of games officially. These games will get a special header in the printed program, as well as a short paragraph presenting the community. So you could have a game of, say, Fiasco "presented by story-games.com"<br/>\n<br/>\nMost likely, we'll ask the communities to submit X number of game, or games by X different people. But it's going to be free, and available only to communities without a financial interest in doing so. (For instance, Le Valet d'Coeur couldn't present a game.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI will get back to all of you once this is sorted out, but this could definitely be a way for you guys to promote story games, especially if a bunch of you plan on attending the Grand Roludothon and running story games there anyway!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJocelyn                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille" title="Jocelyn Robitaille"><img alt="Jocelyn Robitaille" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille">Jocelyn Robitaille</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311713/#Comment_311713" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-08T12:00:02+00:00" title="February  8, 2011 12:00PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh, looks like Walkerp beat me to the punch!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311714/#Comment_311714" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-08T12:01:37+00:00" title="February  8, 2011 12:01PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 8, 2011 12:04PM by jackson_tegu.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the MTL &amp; would certainly consider any meetups in that fine berg,<br/>given proper amount of time to arrange beforehand, and the weather and so on.<br/><br/>edited to say: more meetups which are each smaller is far better.<br/>Everyone make micro meetups!

I'm not familiar with kickstarter so thanks for the heads up. If it's small, shouldn't be hard to cover the rental of a couple of tables for a weekend. Like, I'm thinking five or six tables (thus, maybe forty-ish people max?) If we have it at the loft space, it's located in the mile end, lots of parking, walking distance to lots of great stuff (eats, drinks, places to stay). I definitely feel like this would a relatively small event focus on story games, design, playtesting, playstorming and friendship. I know that last one sounds silly, but honestly, I think one of the evenings should just dedicated to mingling, socializing and bullshiting. <br/><br/>Thanks for the advice Cedric. I'll be hitting up all the gaming stores to put up posters at the the very least when I have something for concrete planned. I'm sure I'll get to talking to them.<br/><br/>Again, my intention was and isn't to compete with Roludo in any way, shape or form. After I had something a little more solid planned, I was going to take this to the Roludo forums. Moreover, I was also my intention to get involve with the Roludo stuff anyways. <br/><br/>Cheers and thanks for the feedback all,<br/>Orlando                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311724/#Comment_311724" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-08T12:38:42+00:00" title="February  8, 2011 12:38PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had a blast as well.

I wasn't suggesting you do it with Roludo to avoid toe-stepping.  I was suggesting you go with them to make sure you get enough people.  If you can get a critical mass to make an event like that, that would be awesome.    It always seemed to me that an area like Mile End could seems like the kind of culture that could support a Go Play type of event.  However, it has been my experience that the numbers just aren't there. That hipster community is sort of divided up into uber-hipsters who wouldn't touch RPGs with the toe of their $250 workboot and Real Geeks of Ubisoft who would probably draw the line at D&amp;D if you could convince them to get off their MMO's for 5 minutes.  I approached Drawn &amp; Quarterly about either putting up a spinning rack or shelf section of indie RPGs and possibly having a storygame night and got a very cold shoulder.  We've been ringing the bell of alternative RPGs for over 5 years now and have only gotten a few answers during that time.  Enough to build up a solid foundation, for sure (thus, Roludo), but not enough that anyone can afford to create their own dedicated events.<br/><br/>This is certainly not proof that it can't be done.  Our methods coud have been sub-optimal.  Human and financial resources were always limited.  And things change.  So please don't let me discourage you with my negativity.  I'm just trying to share my assessment of the situation.  It's very tough to get gamers together in Montreal.  The more we split off into separate groups and organizations, the harder it becomes.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if you do succeed in creating an Allons Jouer scene with regular meetings, that would be very cool.  You could then nurture a small army of storygames aficionados who could come to the Grand Roludothon and present a united front with lots of fun games for people to try.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311754/#Comment_311754" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-08T14:19:59+00:00" title="February  8, 2011  2:19PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, Olman, I'm picking up what you're putting down.

If that's okay with you guys, I'll ramble on a bit about us, because I think the philosophy behind Roludo is something you guys might appreciate. (That, and it'll calm any worries about "competing against Roludo" you guys might have.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOur goal was never to be the be-all end-all of gaming in Montreal, at least not in a centralized manner. Our official mission statement, roughly translated (our official documents are in french) pretty much sums it best: our goal is to promote networking and discussion amongst the Montreal gaming community (which means both Larger Montreal-based gamers and people interested in gaming with Larger Montreal-based gamers.) As far as we're concerned, as long as people flock to Roludo to get their own thing on the community's radar, everything is working out like we want it too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Roludothons are more a matter of community members getting together than it is an official mini-con. We don't publicize it, and we don't actively try to draft participants. As long as there's enough games offered to meet the demand, we're happy. The only issue is that it takes around 25-30 participants for us to be able to rent gaming space while charging an entry fee that isn't too high (according to us: 10,00$), and that our free gaming venue (my home) gets a bit cramped when the number of participants go over 20. I think this is the so-called "critical mass" Walkerp was talking about. At some point, you might get too big to host your event in a free venue, but not big enough to make space rental float financially.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, there's the Grand Roludothon. In our vision, a big con is essential for the Montreal community to have decent networking and discussion among gamers. Our initial plan was to support Draconis as much as we could by encouraging people to run stuff at the con, and be ready to pick up the mantle if they decided to drop the con gig. They did, and we stepped up - hence the Grand Roludothon. It's a way for us to act our official mission statement, albeit a pretty big and time-consuming way. This is why we're doing a con. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd of course, we'd rather not see other gaming events around the time of the Grand Roludothon. Truth be told, we're putting in tons of hours and taking on a fairly big financial risk to make this thing happen. So, of course, we'd like for the Grand Roludothon to be the big thing in Montreal in June when you're a gamer. It's a bigger pay-off for our efforts, and a bigger safety net for our financial risk. But we also think that supporting the Grand Roludothon instead of doing a smaller event around that time of the year is a win-win situation. When we created Roludo, we strongly believed that we could develop a sort of symbiotic relationship with every other gaming event / group / organization. We thought people could join the community, make us bigger and more dynamic, make us more awesome. In turn, we could be a rallying point where they could advertise and draft gamers for projects of their own, build momentum by piggybacking our own. It hasn't been a year yet, and we're happy to say it's working pretty well thus far - both ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, I'll stop my rambling now. :-D                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311816/#Comment_311816" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-08T23:21:07+00:00" title="February  8, 2011 11:21PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, Roludo sounds really great!

Which might sound mercenary, but hey, we want to game with friends, so allow some time for people to meet and become friends without having to be focused on a game. That said, don't mandate it as social time only, no games allowed. Just build it into the weekend schedule\u2014here are the scheduled gaming blocks, and here's some unscheduled time\u2014and let people do as they please, even if that means some games break out.<br/><br/>Our Friday Night Feast at Go Play NW grew out of the impromptu gathering the first year, when people arriving on Friday afternoon for the weekend naturally grouped up to go find dinner and hang out. We've formalized the dinner part (although it's still ticketed as a separate optional event, in case people can't make it at that time or for whatever reason would rather do something else for dinner) but the goal is still the same, to give people some time to just hang out and socialize before plunging into the heavy gaming of the weekend. And by this point we've now got impromptu post-con dinners happening on Sunday evening.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jocelyn Robitaille</cite>And of course, we'd rather not see other gaming events around the time of the Grand Roludothon.</blockquote>\nThis is also important, especially when you're starting out. Check the calendar, look up the dates of the various big cons as well as some of the smaller ones and in particular the local ones, and look for an open weekend that doesn't overlap other stuff. Last year we lost at least one person because we didn't know about PaizoCon, which was scheduled for the same weekend. Not a big deal, someone's always going to have some kind of unfortunate conflict, but still we'd rather avoid that kind of conflict whenever we can\u2014which is why we also made a point of trying to avoid Origins, which also happens in June. <br/><br/>One other note, we formed a non-profit corporation because our initial host, Seattle University, wanted to deal with a single organization rather than 60 individuals trying to book dorm rooms for the event, and we figured if we were going to be handling other people's money then for legal reasons we'd be better off as a non-profit corp. I Am Not A Lawyer, the laws will be different in Canada, funding things as an individual through Kickstarter may avoid that sort of necessity, but it's worth checking out. I'm sure Roludo can help you out with determining whether that sort of thing is necessary for Allons Jouer.<br/><br/>I think it's cool that you're stepping forward to organize this. I've never been to Montr\xe9al, despite growing up in NH and being of French-Canadian descent, and if my financial situation were at all in better shape I'd consider attending.

While checking the numbers for our Roludothons (our in-house day-long gaming events), I figured I ought to verify that claim. It turns out that 27,8% of the games played were story games. If you take the board gaming and war gaming events out of the equation and look only at RPGs, this number climbs up to 37%. In terms of players, 42,5% of the participants who attended at least one Roludothon played at least one story game.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the record, part of those numbers come from projections, because our fourth Roludothon is taking place this sunday. However, unless a game gets cancelled out of the blue or someone fails to show up (which hasn't happened much thus far), the above numbers should be pretty accurate.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully, this'll be interesting to you guys.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313664">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313664/#Comment_313664" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-22T09:52:31+00:00" title="February 22, 2011  9:52AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, Jocelyn, thanks for crunching those numbers!<br/><br/>Since the subject is often blurry in discussion on these boards (and remains blurry for me, personally), what criteria did you use to define a "story game"? <br/><br/>&amp; also please understand, i know little of Roludo &amp; am not a critic, &amp; also i've only a passing interest in the topic: therefore, i ask you to put in an equally small amount of work to answer my question.<br/><br/>&amp; hope you have a great day!<br/>-jackson                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

I totally knew I would get called out on this.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, I went with pretty much every game which did not follow the traditional structure of RPGs, especially with regards to task / conflict resolution and with the way control over the fiction is distributed between the GM and the players.<br/>\n<br/>\nConcretely, this definition ends up including games from the whole Burning shelf even though they're pretty much their own thang, and excluding [small press / indie]-but-traditional games such as Little Fears.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's not perfect as far as a definition, but it works.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
