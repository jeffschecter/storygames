The players and game master build their characters -- and the adventure -- together by discovering each other's histories. We've started out with village kids on their first great adventure: a cult threatening their village.<br/><br/>Anyone with a background in OSR games will already be comfortable with the core rules of Beyond the Wall, although we have changed the magic system to better reflect our influences (A Wizard of Earthsea and The Chronicles of Prydain).<br/><br/>While no-prep oneshots with a familiar old system were the big deal, the game's core supports -- or should support -- full campaign play.<br/><br/>If any of you have some time to take a look and let me know what you think, I would greatly appreciate it. I am happy to answer any questions.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.flatlandgames.com/btw/" rel="nofollow">www.flatlandgames.com/btw/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frax" title="Frax"><img alt="Frax" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/171/nAE5WKWJKMOK4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Frax">Frax</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386349/#Comment_386349" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-04T01:31:48+00:00" title="August  4, 2012  1:31AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi John<br/><br/>I would certainly be interested in play testing your game - although may I be cheeky and propose a swop.  <br/><br/>I think my game dovetails nicely with yours actually.

I know everyone is going to love the fact it has playbooks.<br/><br/>WtDiG *is* very system-light partly because that is my preferred style but also partly because I wanted the challenge of creating a functional game with no conflict resolution mechanic.  <br/><br/>A couple of my friends have also picked upon the spotlight tracking sheet and I am in the middle of getting it prettied up and will probably release it as a standalone tool on Black Armada pretty soon.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frax" title="Frax"><img alt="Frax" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/171/nAE5WKWJKMOK4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Frax">Frax</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386522/#Comment_386522" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-06T23:10:05+00:00" title="August  6, 2012 11:10PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Ya know it would be funny as all get out to play <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Beyond the Wall</span> on like a Saturday and then turn around and play <span style="text-decoration: underline;">When the Dark is Gone</span> on Sunday with the 'same' characters.<br/>--<br/>TAZ<br/></blockquote>\n<img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>There is definitely a zeitgeist happening I reckon!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/john" title="john"><img alt="john" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/john">john</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386550/#Comment_386550" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-07T09:24:31+00:00" title="August  7, 2012  9:24AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 7, 2012 9:25AM by john.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>Ya know it would be funny as all get out to play <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Beyond the Wall</span> on like a Saturday and then turn around and play <span style="text-decoration: underline;">When the Dark is Gone</span> on Sunday with the 'same' characters.<br/>--<br/>TAZ<br/></blockquote>\n<img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>There is definitely a zeitgeist happening I reckon!</blockquote>\nThat sounds brilliant at first blush.

Firstly, because the players would be free to disagree about some of the interpretations of what happened in the first game (which could be fun) and secondly because they could misremember other events and things from the world that didn't get played though - even using some of the stuff in the playbooks and GM scenario as the story seeds.<br/><br/>Not quite the same game but if you wanted to run them together (and it would be kinda cool!) I reckon it would be doable.<br/><br/>But I also want to see what TAZ would do with it <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386581">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antisinecurist" title="Antisinecurist"><img alt="Antisinecurist" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antisinecurist">Antisinecurist</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386581/#Comment_386581" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-07T12:17:32+00:00" title="August  7, 2012 12:17PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What about if you do WtDiG first, then go in and actually play-through it in BtW?<br/>Although, that may be exactly the same issue (only in reverse).<br/><br/>- Alex                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386583">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frax" title="Frax"><img alt="Frax" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/171/nAE5WKWJKMOK4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Frax">Frax</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386583/#Comment_386583" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-07T12:34:54+00:00" title="August  7, 2012 12:34PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lol - I think it would be more of a stuggle to make that work, but if you want to give it a go...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
