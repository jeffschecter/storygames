These mechanics allow players to include or prevent the inclusion of certain other mechanics in the game they may or may not enjoy.  I'll give two examples:<br/><br/>1. In a card game called Battleline, there are special cards that can be played to either screw with your opponent or basically serve as wild cards to make the game feel less deterministic, more random, and to otherwise throw a wrench into your opponent's well-laid plans to count cards and win the game.  The counterbalancing mechanic for these cards is that any player may only play one before giving his opponent the opportunity to play one.  Thus, if I don't like these cards, I'll simply never play one and my opponent will only ever get to play 1 the entire game.  He has the consolation that at least he got to play one to help him out and I never got to play any.  I get the consolation that our game wasn't full of these cards being played.<br/><br/>2. In another card game called Asante, there are animal cards which (I recall) are the only cards that directly impact the other player in a negative way.  The counterbalancing mechanic of them is that, instead of playing animal cards, you can retain them in your hand to block another player's animal from being played against you.<br/><br/>It struck me how both of these examples, while they don't radically change how the game is played, allow players to essentially vote during play on whether a mechanic with a particular style that they may or may not like will make a presence in the game, and even how much.  In these examples the styles or play could be described to be "increased chaos" and "screwing over your opponent" or whatever.  I think the concept could be applied to much more, however.<br/><br/>So I'm wondering about some of the more traditional or classic designs for roleplaying games that some folks tend to call "toolboxes".  The kinds of games where different gaming groups came up with their own ways to apply certain rules to meet their own agendas (knowingly or unwittingly).  What if there had been built-in counterbalancing mechanics for some of these various ways to approach the rules?  This is a hard one for me to come up with an example now because it would require me to have played enough of a particular game with enough groups to discover very specific and consistent patterns in such kinds of rules applications.  But I have noticed these trends over the past ~15 years of communicating online with table top role-players, even if I can't recall an example right now.<br/><br/>But now this is in my head and I'm going to be on the lookout for it.  It might make for some fun design.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438333/#Comment_438333" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-14T09:22:54+00:00" title="September 14, 2014  9:22AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting topic.

Probably not the best thought, but I'll get it down.<br/><br/>I'm the GM and I decide to write a little plot in my usually very sandbox game.  I would <i>like</i> for the player characters to have an encounter with a gang on their turf right at the moment they're running away from a heist they pulled at the bank.<br/><br/>But one of the PCs decides to open a manhole and drop down into the sewers.  In true sandbox form, I would let them handle the situation however they want.  In true railroad form, I might tell them all the manholes on this street happen to be cemented shut.  Some players like sandbox, some like to be railroaded (to some extent, although I think this is a minority).<br/><br/>So a counterbalancing mechanic might be to say to the player (or players) "Your destiny isn't to go down into the sewers today" and offer up a destiny token.  If all players take the token, one of them (or myself) can narrate a reason why they can't take the sewers, like the manhole being too heavy, etc.<br/><br/>Otherwise, they can say "screw destiny" and not be railroaded, if they're not okay with that right now.  This is a kind of meta-gamey mechanic, so some might not be okay with that.<br/><br/>Hm, maybe "meta-gamey" rules or player-controlled story narration is another mechanic that could utilize counterbalancing though....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438347/#Comment_438347" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-14T19:47:05+00:00" title="September 14, 2014  7:47PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Fate compels are what you're looking for here.

A lot of the stuff a given roleplayer might wish to include or exclude from play isn't covered by mechanics.  "Try another way" from <a href="http://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/2012/09/20/archipelago-iii/" rel="nofollow">Archipelago</a> (and others) is a nice example of a counterbalance to players' narrative freedom.  Pre-game "is there anything we really do/don't want to see in play?" rituals have some degree of popularity as well.  I think your railroad/not-railroad example falls into this category -- the player isn't really turning off a <i>mechanic</i>, they're turning off a <i>GMing approach</i>.<br/><br/>That's not to say that toolbox RPGs can't have subsystems that are subject to limits or costs.  But I suspect that'll only work either (a) up-front, before anyone's invested in avenues of effectiveness that a rule change would shut down, or (b) on really marginal stuff that no character concept or GM plot relies on.  I think it's harder to change a play strategy when you're using a single character than when you're using (e.g.) a fluid deck.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438519/#Comment_438519" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-18T19:11:45+00:00" title="September 18, 2014  7:11PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 18, 2014 7:12PM by Paul_T.">edited September 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I keep thinking of that situation in a game where a player A really doesn't like fights, so s/he buys really high combat abilities and invulnerability to physical damage for their main character.<br/><br/>It's kind of a pre-emptive attempt to stop the GM from doing certain things in play, at least in some cases.<br/><br/>There might some of that kind of stuff happening with character builds and types of adventures and/or monster abilities, perhaps?<br/><br/>I can see that being a big source of interplay between players and a GM in, say, an exploratory sandbox game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438524/#Comment_438524" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-18T21:29:28+00:00" title="September 18, 2014  9:29PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh!

Or the players don't want to deal with the consequences of their decisions. Both cases mechanics won't fix the issue.  If mechanics are altered in an attempt to resolve the issue then they rapidly wind up either not reflecting the setting or the setting alters to conforms to the new mechanics. In either case the campaigns suffers.<br/><br/>In the first case the referee need to learn that the points of the whole experiences is for the players to experience an alternative reality as their characters which includes the freedom to choice how they make their way. <br/><br/>In the second case the player need to realize that their choices have consequences, if they screw up their choice then it will cause unpleasant consequences which could mean total failure. WIthout the possibility of screwing up then the feeling one gets from achieving a desired goal is lessened. And players need also to realize that a total screwup and subsequent events could make for a far more interesting experience than what was originally planned.<br/><br/>When the two problems show up at once well fireworks ensue.<br/><br/>Also realize the above two are not absolute, they exist on a spectrum and for most players with this problem is only for specific instances and specific aspects of the game. <br/><br/>Specifically for what I quoted, if a players doesn't like fighting he shouldn't pick fights. And if he can't avoid not getting into fights then referee needs to told firmly out of game that he not focusing enough on the non-combat aspects of his campaign. And if the referee is not receptive to this then it is time for another campaign run by somebody else who is more in tune with what the group wants to play at that time. Not amount of new or additional rules mechanic is going to alter this.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438552/#Comment_438552" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-19T10:15:18+00:00" title="September 19, 2014 10:15AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Yes, I wasn't saying it was necessarily a positive or productive thing that happens, just something I've seen discussed more than a few times.

Rules take a back seat and generally advantages and set backs  <br/>can be discussed.<br/>E.g. Fumble:  The crown falls from the wraiths head reducing his power?  <br/>You don't simulate that through rules it just happens because of the fumble. A narrative counter balance to keep the game dramatic.<br/> </blockquote>\nAh, I totally get this now!  I was reading you as saying Critical successes VS fumbles as the counterbalancing, but you mean more like critical successes/fumbles VS the standard application of rules.  Which leads to opposite approaches to the dichotomy of "rules heavy" vs "rules light" in a given instance.<br/><br/>This is getting close to what I'm talking about.  A missing ingredient I think, is player choice.  That could easily be house-ruled in, though.  Players could be allowed to opt in or out of all critical results on a per session or per adventure basis.<br/><br/>So taking your example every further, players might even be able to choose a critical range.  Rather than critical fumbles/successes on a simple 1 or 20, you might allow them to go all the way down to 5 and 15.  Results in this range maybe aren't automatic successes or failures, but they could still follow the dramatic effect method for resolution as opposed to engaging the "usual" mechanics.<br/><br/>I'm not sure that feels like it would be fun in play though :-/                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438604">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438604/#Comment_438604" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-21T18:14:07+00:00" title="September 21, 2014  6:14PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that's a really hot idea, actually, Big_J.

Anyway, my example of player choice was pretty terrible.  I'll have to think more on this.  Player narrative control, where it leads beyond traditional RPGs, isn't a play dial I usually think about now, but I was pretty curious about it at one point.<br/><br/>The two starting examples I gave inherently had some player versus player interests at stake though, and I wonder if that's a necessary aspect of this to create the seesaw like behavior.<br/><br/>This leads me into thinking about players gaining or losing narrative control of other players' characters.<br/><br/>Which leads me to a house rule for Universalis (which is funny because that's all Universalis is):<br/><br/>"When you take control of a character another player created, put a token in your Hijack Pile.  You can only take control of other characters in this manner if you don't have more tokens in this pile than any other player."<br/><br/>My Universalis lingo might be off, but there you go.  I think this is a good example of the concept.  I still think better/more fun can be done with this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439227/#Comment_439227" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-07T19:09:24+00:00" title="October  7, 2014  7:09PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's an interesting one I encountered in SW d6 the other day. Doubt it's official.<br/><br/>The higher the difficulty is, the less severe minor failures are.<br/><br/>So for example, if you're doing an easy task, say DC 6, then if you roll that 1-5 you're really screwed. OTOH, if you're doing something incredibly hard, with a DC of say 21, and roll a 15 or so, your failure won't be as bad.<br/><br/>This rule is interesting on a number of levels. For one thing, it really forces the GM to think about if they even want you to roll at all for easy stuff!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
