Many of the games that crawled into print back then are still around in some form, which is crazy and cool.  <br/><br/>For whatever reason Detroit was a hotbed of small press publishing.  Besides Palladium, the metro Detroit area was the birthplace of such great games as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Morrow_Project" rel="nofollow">The Morrow Project</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fringeworthy" rel="nofollow">Fringeworthy</a>.  As an absurdly young kid I helped playtest these games at local conventions and gaming clubs.  My brother and I spent $20, a fortune, to buy one of the 100 <i>typewritten </i>first edition copies of The Morrow Project, and we played the living hell out of it for years.  <br/><br/>The very, very best things about The Morrow Project were an absurd fixation on realism (weapons were rated according to real-world data, including inches of penetration in white pine or ballistic gelatin) and the inclusion of Soviet ICBM targeting data that wasn't even available domestically.  Your character had Blood Points.<br/><br/>Local company Tri-Tac games was super visionary - they produced a series of settings using the same unbelievably terrible core system, and each was genuinely unique.  They did dimensional portal exploration years before Stargate, off-kilter paranormal hunting years before Ghostbusters, and hard-ish science fiction years before ... OK, nobody has ever really tried that again.  Transhuman Space, maybe.  They even had their own little home-brewed supplement treadmill, with game-universe crossovers.  This all peaked around 1984 I think.  Dot matrix typeset, GBC bound, truly labors of love.  Really cool stuff.  <br/><br/>So if Detroit had this going on, what happened around the same time in your neck of the woods?  Was there a comparable flowering of small press hotness?  I know this is antediluvian, but the information and games must be out there.  Share what you know!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206733/#Comment_206733" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-11T12:36:06+00:00" title="May 11, 2009 12:36PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Roleplaying really came into Finland as a major phenomenon at the end of the decade, when 1:500 Finns apparently bought the newly translated red box D&amp;D. Being as roleplaying was rather fringe before that, there wasn't much of an indie scene during the '80s. Still, the first Finnish rpg, "\u201dSecret of Raguoc In Acirema Dungeons" (yes, the title was in English), came out in -85, and it was just about as indie as you could get in its photocopied pamphlet glory. This was also the year of founding for the greatest Finnish rpg store of all time, Fantasiapelit.<br/><br/>Later on, all Finnish rpg publishing has been indie, excepting the translations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206752/#Comment_206752" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-11T14:42:21+00:00" title="May 11, 2009  2:42PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ringwielder<br/><br/>It was a crazy sort of "Dark City" thing where a giant generational ship has an accident and the computer goes crazy and rewrites the environment and everybody's memories and forms to match fictional characters and locales.

It's a neat little game and we played the hell out it usually after a night of Car Wars or AD&amp;D. Basically stripped off all the crap on AD&amp;D and let you get on with exploring and killing. Had some major influence from early computer games as well. I want to hack this game some day (well I have notes kicking around somewhere).<br/><br/>From the website (<a href="http://www.kristoffersilver.com/SilverWolf/SilverWolfRPG.html#Role%20Playing%20Games" rel="nofollow">Silverwolf Games</a>)<br/>"The concept for Holocaustic Dungeons originated in 1982. The idea was to create a character or a group of characters-in the case of multiple players. Thrust into a futuristic "dungeon" designed to protect certain artifacts while providing media coverage of the dungeoneers as entertainment for the masses, characters are forced from room to room in an attempt to locate sections to keys and treasures. The game consists of a small instruction booklet although supporting books are also available including character sheets, logs, maps, and other dungeon grids.<br/><br/>The books came out at the time of the first generation of Silver Wolf and had severe start-up difficulties due to the market failure of the time. Yet, the game still exists and I will be releasing the new publications, in time. The rules will be the same, and be backwards compatible.

Those two are pretty much the only Finnish games with English titles. They've had their share of ridicule for it - I don't exactly know why the designers went for English, but I suspect that it has something to do with complete cultural domination of English in early roleplaying around here; perhaps they just thought that the game's name sounds cooler in English. I've met many of those Finnish roleplayers and other nerds who've been in the hobby since the '80s, and some have pretty... "interesting" notions about cultural politics and language, to the tune that English is the only worthwhile language in the world and everything should be in English and so on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_207110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207110/#Comment_207110" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-13T11:31:08+00:00" title="May 13, 2009 11:31AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite><br/>Also, its got a social mechanic!
