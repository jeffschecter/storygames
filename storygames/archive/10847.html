The person furthest back acts then ticks themselves further on the wheel depending on the action taken. If they move past some  one that person then become the active player and they continue ticking forward as they take actions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like it personally but I am kind of interested in every ones thoughts here? The gripe my group has is that it overly complicates things have you found this when using it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_240518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240518/#Comment_240518" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-04T19:10:14+00:00" title="November  4, 2009  7:10PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The timer for the Neuland game is the same idea.  It works pretty slick in that game.  There's a timer marker on the track.  Each time a player takes their turn their actions move them forward on the track.  After their turn, the timer marker is advanced.  The first player it comes to (i.e. farthest back on the track) then takes their turn, and so on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_240520">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240520/#Comment_240520" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-04T19:24:06+00:00" title="November  4, 2009  7:24PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not familiar with this in RPGs, but it's used in the co-op board game "Red November" and works really well there.

(Which plays into the way it represents difficulty of tasks: basically, you say how long you're taking to put out a fire or unblock a hatch, and the longer you take the better your odds of success ... but the closer the timer gets to the end of the game.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_240524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240524/#Comment_240524" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-04T19:51:26+00:00" title="November  4, 2009  7:51PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love it, and I've hacked a version of it for a few other game systems I've run over the years (3.5e D&amp;D, Rifts, other White Wolf Games...).<br><br>It makes a great replacement for initiative in a few of the clunkier game systems out there.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_240536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240536/#Comment_240536" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-04T22:00:45+00:00" title="November  4, 2009 10:00PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been really happy with it.

In a game like Exalted, brain-space is at a premium.  <br/><br/>Adam, default time per tick is squishy, so yeah, not concrete.  But it's only that way for cinematic reasons.  Unless you're in Shaping Combat, you could just rule that it always takes default time per tick.  Maybe a 10-section battle wheel might make it easier to keep track of total time elapsed (at least, easier than multiplying by 7).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_240831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMcS" title="DanMcS"><img alt="DanMcS" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMcS">DanMcS</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240831/#Comment_240831" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-06T13:11:23+00:00" title="November  6, 2009  1:11PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: deadlytoque</cite>I've been really happy with it.
