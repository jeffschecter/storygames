There was a strong thread of eugenics and blood purity that was disturbing and awesome. In the end magic died, as it must, and with it the spark of reason among every beast-man everywhere. The last scene of the game was Alice, the ancient crone who was the first person gifted with magic, saying goodbye to her three little mouse friends as she dropped them (an archivist, a professor and an assassin) off in the woods, answering the question "what is the last word an animal ever says?" It was "We curse you for all time".<br/><br/>So that went well.<br/><br/>Microscope is a deeply weird thing. There's role-playing-ness to it, but no character monogamy, and even less character <i>value</i>. They are just tools, cogs in the larger wheel. This is really liberating.<br/><br/>There's collaboration, but it is asynchronous collaboration. You build on what others have built, but never at the same time. This is extraordinarily difficult, at least for us, because we're conditioned by the games we play to constantly work together, offer alternatives, listen and reflect. In Microscope you get to reincorporate hardcore and that's it. If you offer another player suggestions you are doing it wrong. If nothing else, this puts ingrained habits about creative contribution in extremely sharp relief. We were all skeptical, and to be honest I think we played it a little loose, but damn if it doesn't work. <br/><br/>We had a great time and created a cohesive, succinct timeline that felt pretty satisfying. The game is very simple and the procedures are luminously clear. We basically ran it from the reference sheet in the back without consulting the actual rules once play began. I'd read it thoroughly, but I honestly think you could just sit down and play blind. Not that I am suggesting that, because the book is just a revelation in instructional design. <br/><br/>I suspect that second games are better than first games, since you need to sort through your gamer cruft a bit and adjust your assumptions.<br/><br/>We all agreed that it isn't something we'd hammer week after week, but it will enter our arsenal as an occasional pick-up game. And we all saw the potential as a collaborative tool for building a setting for <i>another </i>game.<br/><br/>*Clinton bravely refused to cross that line.

The directions are very strict about how much gets played out (ie "end a scene when the question is answered, not when the action is resolved"). Did you return to scenes due to that?

You get in fast, and get out fast, and try to focus on the Question. It's a cool collaborative story-telling experience much more so than an immersive free roleplay kind of thing. It seems to work best if you just jump in, make some drama happen, and get out.

Mouse assassin is such a natural choice once you think about it.<br/><br/>Second off: I wouldn't recommend making an effort to downplay role-playing when you play. When I play Microscope, I do a lot of scenes, and I definitely dig in and play the characters as people. I try to make them sincere, explore what makes them tick, etc. I'm using them to answer the Question, but I'm also making them as real and as interesting as possible to the other people at the table, just like any role-playing game.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that's a rule, but that's how I play Microscope and I have a lot of fun that way. Other people leave out played scenes entirely. Like you already said, making scenes or not making scenes is a choice each player gets to make. If particular characters interest any player, you can come back to them. If they don't, you won't.<br/><br/>I think because the "new" part of the game is the vast scope of creation, it's easy to focus on that and think individuals aren't the meat of the game, but every time I play Microscope the scenes are the gold (like the <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=14420&amp;page=2#Comment_328630" rel="nofollow">Davin the Mason scenes</a> I was just talking about in the Fabricated Realities thread). The history creates the context that gives the scenes meaning, but the people and their moments are what we care about and remember, even when they have no impact on big deeds and just reflect the times.<br/><br/>Zooming in and zooming out go hand-in-hand.
