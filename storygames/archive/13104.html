That should loosen his tongue!", then you've spent it and there's no need to worry about losing it at all. <i>However</i>, if it's spent on something that sticks around (possessions, property, etc.), and something should happen to those tangible investments, you lose XP equal to their value until/unless you get them back. <br/>This could create some interesting dynamics. Certainly, there's something of a precedent for exploring in this direction: the AD&amp;D paladin has to tithe 10% of his earnings to his church or temple, and some editions and settings suggest or demand that clerics do something similar. <br/><br/>This could set up a scenario in which players dutifully haul their gold back to the front door of the dungeon, and then decide how much to keep for necessities and things, and how much to fritter away. Maybe charitable acts, done outside the context of a "you scratch my back..." exchange, could also count as throwing the cash away. If there's no explicit tit-for-tat going on, such that the recipient of your charity is not literally obligated to help you in return (but maybe the GM remembers your good deed for another day), then you've gotten rid of the gold successfully.<br/><br/>I think this could make things interesting at higher levels, too - the ubiquitous lordly title that fighters earn at 9th level comes with a keep and followers; what if squandering these gifts made you lose XP? Or is that hitting the player twice? Since repairing the damage done bumps you back up to where you were, it shouldn't be too harsh, but it does give me pause for thought about the ramifications.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
