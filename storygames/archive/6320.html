It wasn't a bad game.  It turned out okay.  But it didn't sing to me the way it did the previous two times I've played it.  I think I've figured out why.<br/><br/>All my friends are dirty hippie easy going California liberals.<br/><br/>Okay, Okay...  before all the shocked glares condemn my soul to hell let me explain.  The hardboiled detective genre is ultimately about judgment.  However, in novel form the author has the opportunity to stack the deck.  He can arrange things (like deciding who the murderer is) to give the exact circumstances needed to have the detective make the judgment the author wants him to.  This isn't possible in Dirty Secrets.<br/><br/>However, I would like to proclaim that it is still a game about judgment.  More importantly without that judgment the game doesn't really work.  This is the practical truth behind the mandate that "everyone should have working theory."  In practice this means that every player should pass judgment on the characters based on what has been revealed so far... but more importantly they should *FIGHT* for that.  That's how you stay engaged as an Adviser, by nudging the narration to favor your judgments.<br/><br/>This is what I meant by my over statement above.  All my friends are way too easy going and non-judgmental.  Any old narration that enters play is fine by them.  They roll with the punches a little too well and forget to throw a few punches of their own.<br/><br/>In the first game where I was the investigator there was a point where I really came to HATE a particular character.  I narrated stuff into that game, including stuff outside the control of the investigator (which neither Authority bothered to block) to make that character look guilty as sin.  When we played the Grey Ranks/Dirty Secret cross over there were definitely certain characters with which the group decided were antagonistically villainous and characters we felt sorry for regardless of their guilt or innocence relative to the crimes.  Note: the character the group felt was the most antagonistic ended up being guilty of none of the crimes and the investigator took significant action against her.  I think this is an important feature of play, not a bug.<br/><br/>To a lesser extent this applies to the details of the crimes as well.  I remember when I was the investigator I became convinced (in my own head) that one of the Thefts had occurred to make a suicide look like murder.  And I started playing hard to push that into play.  Inventing evidence, even providing answers to my own interrogation questions.  But I think the judgment and portrayal of the "NPCs" for lack of better term is MORE important and will lead to the invention of these details about the crimes.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139807">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139807/#Comment_139807" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-15T13:10:59+00:00" title="April 15, 2008  1:10PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "But!" cry those familiar with the game, "where does this judgment and commitment come from when the game gives you so little to go on!" Heh.  And here's where I give away the Dirty Secret of Dirty Secrets: This is what the demographics are for.  Think about it.  Horrified?  GOOD.<br/><br/>Like it or not we all make kneejerk assumptions from these values.  At worst they're stereotypes and at best they're simply the sum of our (limited scope) experiences.  I suggest that healthy functional Dirty Secrets play is to simply accept this and more importantly play to it.  If you offend someone at the table, GOOD, hopefully they'll jump in and twist your initial character portrayal in a creative and interesting way that pushes the game in a new direction.  If you want to be a little more mindful of things, take a moment to catch your kneejerk thought, and give it a little creative spin yourself.<br/><br/>I did that in the game this weekend.  We had a Rich, White, Woman married to a slightly older man who was up to some shady land dealing stuff.  The Investigator was Hispanic.  My kneejerk thought was that she would be disdainfully racist of him... then I changed my mind and decided the opposite.  That she actually had a thing for Hispanic men caught up in the mystic and rumors of their firey and passionate nature.  Was I trading perhaps one stereotype for another?  Perhaps, but it lead to an interesting scene.<br/><br/>From another point of view this is why I don't ever use Pacific Islander as a demographic.  Not because I'm a racist with something against Pacific Islanders but because I'm completely ignorant of Pacific Islander culture and their perceived cultural role in "my home town."  I leave Pacific Islanders out of my Dirty Secrets BECAUSE I am non-judgmental about them.<br/><br/>Before I get roasted at the stake for saying all this let me remind you that my point is that kneejerk reaction to the demographics whether stereotype based or not is meant to be the STARTING point.  Hopefully over the course of the game the characters will evolve as players add details and pass judgment of their own.  I'm not saying that someone should stake out a claim on a judgment and viciously defend it without ever reconsidering.  I'm saying that you should embrace your current judgment and play passionately to it until something enters play that genuinely changes your opinion.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the most rewarding thing I find about playing the Investigator is not so much the spotlight role but that I get the final word on passing judgment over the characters.  How, I choose to justify the "random" outcome of the Crimes is my opportunity proclaim loudly and viciously what I think of the characters.  Which is why I was a little disappointed when we came to the end of the Dirty Secrets game and our investigator player didn't have a committed idea on how everything came together.  In fact, I ended up putting things together, which was cool and I liked what I came up with but part of what I like about NOT being the Investigator is seeing what final judgment (which is what justifying the crimes REALLY amounts to) that player comes to based on everyone else's input.<br/><br/>Jesse<br/><br/>P.S. I speak with authority in all my essays simply based on my own play experience.  I do not intend to step on the design intent of their authors.  Feel free to shut me up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139817/#Comment_139817" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-15T13:29:58+00:00" title="April 15, 2008  1:29PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see what you are getting at, and agree a bit with your idea that the game (or any narration passing/collaborative game, really) works better when people have a clear idea of what they're after. However, it shouldn't be at all surprising when the Investigator comes to a denouement and has only a vague notion of what the mystery is about - the random Crime Resolution practically demands that the Investigator keep every possibility open, or risk being seen as a bit bumbling (in one-person writing, or normal GMing, an investigator has another option - they were intentionally deceived by someone, but because none of the other contributors in Dirty Secrets know who did it either, it's hard to actually set up and follow through with a decent deception.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139818/#Comment_139818" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-15T13:31:54+00:00" title="April 15, 2008  1:31PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse,<br/><br/>One minor rules correction:  whoever earned the right to move the Witness during the Chapter gets to spell out the details of the Crime that was resolved.

I tried to design the game to provoke those sort of kneejerk responses, hopefully with players then having the opportunity to examine those responses.  In my experience, one of the Demographics becomes the focus of attention during the game.  The only thing is that there's really no way to predict which one it will be.  But, over the course of the game, one will emerge.<br/><br/>In other words:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>Before I get roasted at the stake for saying all this let me remind you that my point is that kneejerk reaction to the demographics whether stereotype based or not is meant to be the STARTING point.

I know the Authority gets to match up the Crime with the name of the grid if they won the conflict that scene and it results in Crime Resolution but I thought all they could say is, Name on Grid is responsible for this Crime.  The How and Why don't come out until the Investigator finds out in the fiction either by having the Investigator player decide the Investigator has some kind of epiphany or a confession of some kind is narrated.<br/><br/>In play this is why I say final judgment goes to the Investigator.  Because let's say the Authority wins the last scene that matches a name with a final crime.  That automatically results in the Finale which is setup by the Investigator which *usually* results in the Investigator framing a scene in which they "sum up" their findings and declaring the how and why for whatever crime details have not previously entered play usually in a confrontation with the person responsible.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139844">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139844/#Comment_139844" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-15T15:11:14+00:00" title="April 15, 2008  3:11PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>The How and Why don't come out until the Investigator finds out in the fiction either by having the Investigator player decide the Investigator has some kind of epiphany or a confession of some kind is narrated.</blockquote>\nAh, I see what you're saying now.
