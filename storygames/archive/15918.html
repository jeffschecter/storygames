Whenever I have an event coming up, I invite them and typically a small handful of them (3-5) show up. For the last three sessions, when I attempted to do Don't Rest Your Head, I had, at best, one person showing up, so I figured folks might have just moved on to other things.<br/><br/>Then I announced that the next event was Lady Blackbird.<br/><br/>I've had a rush of responses so far because it looks like the game concept is hooking them in all the right places. The thing is now I'm concerned that there may be several more people coming than there are pre-existing characters for the game. This may be like the night I ended up doing a nine-person game of InSpectres (which actually did work out, though folks didn't get quite as much spotlight time as I'd have liked).<br/><br/>I'm not sure I'll have enough time to create extra PCs before it happens, so can anyone point me to any resources where there might be more characters for the game?  o_0                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_361698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361698/#Comment_361698" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T11:03:20+00:00" title="February 23, 2012 11:03AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, the characters are all pretty tightly knit.

I can see doing it for six or maybe seven players, but beyond that it might get a bit messy (or rather, hard to split the group's focus for EVERYONE at once). So what I may do is 1) relegate extra players to being NPCs (something I've done with relative success in the past in other games, at least) or 2) set up a second table for the extra players and have them play Fiasco - I think perhaps enough of the group are familiar with it now that I won't have to facilitate for them.<br/><br/>Of course, the third option would be to somehow turn it into a LARP, but that might be a tad too ambitious for something I'm intending to do quickly in my apartment... <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362031/#Comment_362031" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T20:08:15+00:00" title="February 23, 2012  8:08PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9882" rel="nofollow">I made an extra character here.</a><br/><br/>But I'm with the split-the-group crowd.

Let's take the bodyguard as an example. One of the bodyguards leans on her relationship with LB, the other leans on her relationship with the captain (right? that's the bodyguard's other relationship?). And the two bodyguards have a close &amp; complicated relationship with one another, that you devise. <br/><br/>When we played, the relationships were much more important than the mechanics because, y'know, not enough time for all of us to both talk and engage the mechanics meaningfully. I bet you could, should you take this route, have the twin sets be mechanically identical. <br/><br/>Now, i don't think this is a <i>good</i> idea.<br/><br/>This is a last-ditch idea to weld a new weird part onto the game so that you can all socialize behind an awesome fantasy veneer for a few hours.

I've now got a couple more characters I can draw on if needed.<br/><br/>As for getting two games of LB going at once, that would be awesome if we could pull it off, but the trouble is - er, to be frank, very few of the folks coming over are going to be very used to the "listening and asking questions" style of GMing required (and the one or two who might be able to do it out of the gate have already expressed a desire to play it first before trying to run it for other people). Most of them have been pretty much exclusively playing D&amp;D and World of Darkness for the last several years and I think they'll probably need to see how it works before they really grasp it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362453">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362453/#Comment_362453" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T14:50:20+00:00" title="February 24, 2012  2:50PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Invite fewer people.

I must say, though, that it's a testament to the appeal of this game that I got such a positive response from people so quickly. It's an awesome concept.<br/><br/>I think I've gotten into the habit of "overstuffing the invitation box" as a means of getting what would be considered an average number of players. Typically a lot of people will be interested, but in practice only a few of them actually show up. I'm used to this because I usually run games my friends have never heard of, so whenever they come over to play they're always having to dip their toes in something they're completely unfamiliar with. As a result, they can be a bit intimidated and hesitant to put in an appearance sometimes (also, you have the standard adult/life/kids/job/schedule thing going on with them that makes it difficult for them to make time for leisure activities - or they just forget, which happens a lot as well; most of the folks I play games with are a lot of fun to have in a game but are extremely casual about concepts like time and attendance). That combined with the vicissitudes of Facebook Events has made for one of those situations in which I have no idea how many folks will ACTUALLY show up (though, granted, that seems to be a pretty common thing for Facebook Events).<br/><br/>So it's just as likely that I'll have about the right number (or fewer) as it is that I'll have too many people. But I like to have a contingency plan, so extra folk who turn up will sit out this one or maybe play a different game at a second table and will get to play Lady Blackbird next time (those who manage to make it next time... <i>sigh</i>...). 0_o                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian" title="Sanglorian"><img alt="Sanglorian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian">Sanglorian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362582/#Comment_362582" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-25T09:06:53+00:00" title="February 25, 2012  9:06AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the link to the Year of Living Free, folks.
