John White's watercolors are the centerpiece and star of the show.  Even though they were all damaged in 1865, they are still jaw-droppingly great - looking at them puts you only one remove from his eyes, seeing the people and animals of the New World for the first time.  I spent a lot of time trying to puzzle out his cultural bias in the depictions of the native people he sketched.  There are clues - White's animals are occasionally not quite right, for example (his bald eagle is particularly out of proportion) and his early watercolors of Inuit abducted during Frobisher's expedition show some unconscious bias - the Greenlander's paddle, otherwise quite accurate, has nicely turned stops, like an armoire.  But it's clear he was <i>trying </i>to capture what he saw, and it is fascinating.  The pieces that depict ceremony were a bit of a shock - I don't know much about the eastern woodland tradition, but he shows an ecstatic dance among the Secotan in a ring of wooden pillars all carved with men's faces, and a funereal building for dead chieftains, who were (apparently) carefully skinned and gutted, with their muscles and guts stored at their feet, and the skins re-covering the skeletons.  This "temple" was guarded by an idol, a squatting coal black figure named Kiwasa.  White painted a gorgeous watercolor of a dude with a mummified bird in his hair - a shaman who "trafficked with the devil".  It was excellent, thought-provoking, and inspirational.  <br/><br/>Also cool - the <a href="http://www.meekmok.com/sassy/images/roanoke/roanoke_dare_stone_02.jpg" rel="nofollow">Dare</a> <a href="http://www.meekmok.com/sassy/images/roanoke/roanoke_dare_stone_01.jpg" rel="nofollow">stones</a>, creepy fakes that supposedly tell the story of the lost colonists, post disaster.

I've been wanting to see the exhibit and now even more.  It is a fascinating time of NC and national history.  I'm interested in the Roanoke game.
