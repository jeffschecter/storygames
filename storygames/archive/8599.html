The hard part is doing it in a way that's fun. I mean if you restirct things too far it ends becoming a board game like runescape or something. <br/><br/>I actually find that some of the most freeform games can feel kind of restrictive at times. For example, in 3:16 you can't actually do that many things, although you get a lot of liberty in describing what happens, and technically you could do whatever, but only a few options are mechanically rewarded. In the case of 3:16 though, I think that it's very much a good thing, as it promotes people realizing the meaningless of the combat, and allows the game to be taught extremely quickly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190587/#Comment_190587" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-29T17:28:22+00:00" title="January 29, 2009  5:28PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You might look at computer games, actually.

It's easy enough, as the GM, to make things restrictive by saying, "No, you can't do that" but that sounds cheap and lame.  I suppose the other route is to have a very specific list of the things that are allowed, and everything that isn't on the list is forbidden.<br/><br/>I'd like to be clear: the restrictiveness <i>isn't supposed to be fun</i>.  It's supposed to be lame and crappy and annoying.  The players should be thinking, "This sucks!  I want to have more options!"<br/><br/>Of course, obviously, that sucks.  The idea is then, after sucking for a brief time, certain things in the game will start to change, mechanically, that will open up more and more options.  But unless it feels restrictive to begin with, I don't think the building freedom will be significant.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190589/#Comment_190589" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-29T17:58:18+00:00" title="January 29, 2009  5:58PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To build on JD's comment - the old text adventures did this by giving you a very minimal starting point with only a few exits.<br/><br/>"You are in an empty 10x10 room.

I have no idea what the state of the game currently is but the idea was that you are playing robots on a long forgotten amusement park planet designed to function like a swashbuckling adventure.  Over the eons some of the robots have started to develop an awareness of the fact that they're just machines following a program and slowly gain free will.<br/><br/>So the idea was that early on the GM was intended to create a very linear, pre-plotted swashbuckling scenarios.  If you did something that wouldn't follow the plot of the scenario the GM could literally just say, "No, your programming takes over, you do this instead."  The thing of it is that there's a mechanic representing how free-willed your robot had become.  So if you didn't want to do what the GM told you to do you could roll.  Early on you'd fail a lot and would more or less live out the GM's adventure, but the idea is that as the game goes on you'll start succeeding in those rolls more and more and more until you don't have to follow the adventure any more.<br/><br/>But now you know you're robot on a forgotten world that's running in a endless pre-programmed loop.... What do you do?<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190591/#Comment_190591" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-29T18:27:09+00:00" title="January 29, 2009  6:27PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike and JD, I play a lot of IF, and I've played a lot of old text adventures as well, so I get what you're saying, but I'm looking for a good way to restrict characters <i>as characters</i> rather than <i>through their situations</i>, if that makes sense.  I mean, I'm in a room with one door right now, but I don't feel particularly restricted in what I can do in my life because of that, except in the most immediate, trivial sense.<br/><br/>This question, incidentally, was directly spurred by <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=190521" rel="nofollow">Adam Dray's post</a> in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=190505" rel="nofollow">this thread about sanity mechanics.</a>  He suggested that should "feel claustrophobic" rules-wise so that the insanity could be freeing.  I thought that was a really kick-ass idea, but the more I thought about it, the more I couldn't think of an obvious way to do such a thing, at least without feeling like a dick GM and frequently saying, "You can't do that, cuz I said so."  The best thing I can think of so far is to have a list of possible mechanical options a player can take in the text, and have only a very small number of them available from the start, and have players able to see that immediately so they can see, "Wow, I can't do jack right now... time to break down the barriers and open this bitch up!"  but that seems almost equally as ham-handed and inelegant.  The main advantage there is that the GM gets to go, "Oh no see, it's not that I'm not letting you do that, it's right there in the rulebook."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190592/#Comment_190592" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-29T18:47:52+00:00" title="January 29, 2009  6:47PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Steal Away Jordan does this really, really well in my opinion.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190594/#Comment_190594" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-29T19:03:34+00:00" title="January 29, 2009  7:03PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            hmmm, i have the pdf of SAJ but i've never played it.  i'll have to at least read through it more.<br/>do you think it does that through mechanics?  i mean, i know about some things, like the GM getting to name the characters and establish their worth and things like that.  what does it do during play that creates a restrictive claustrophobic feeling?  and do you think those elements can be divorced from SAJ's setting?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190599/#Comment_190599" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-29T20:21:59+00:00" title="January 29, 2009  8:21PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brian, I like restrictive roleplaying games.

What I am describing below isn't even in the current version of my game, because it was <i>too constraining</i>.<br/><br/>In prior versions of this game, you started a scene by figuring out what you wanted your character to do and how that changed the network (the giant statted relationship map that the game uses as the central vehicle of play). There was a lot of game business going on, right there on the network. Players moved dice around that network like it was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_(game)" rel="nofollow">RISK</a> board. Now, because the network was so much in focus during the game, it became the game and the role-playing filled in the cracks. <br/><br/>As a result, play became very restricted. You sorta had to think about what you wanted to do. The RISK-ish elements of the game meant that you couldn't interact with every node of the network in a meaningful (mechanical) way; only the nodes adjacent to other nodes you controlled. Players naturally ignored the parts of the network "far" from their character. By increasing the number and complexity of mechanical points of contact, and limiting mechanical effects to a local section of the fiction (as defined on the network), the rules naturally limited the number of choices a player <i>had</i> and constrained them in a pretty amazing way. It was cool (because players didn't have to pay attention to the whole, complex network all at once) but it was also constraining role-play in a way that I didn't like. Ultimately, I nixed that element.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190604">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190604/#Comment_190604" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-29T21:13:37+00:00" title="January 29, 2009  9:13PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another game you should check out is Waiting/Tea. It's a small game written by Jonathan Walton in PUSH 1.<br/><br/>The game is inspired by simple Interactive Fiction games. It stars two characters. One is the daughter of a lady who starts play at the gates of a temple. She is waiting for a proper invitation inside. The other character is a young monk who has been told by his master in the temple to make tea. Making tea requires him to fetch water, which is outside the temple. He needs to find a bucket for water.<br/><br/>In Waiting/Tea, you have a small number of actions you can take. This list changes in each map area that you visit. You're always free to talk. So in the room with the bucket, you gain a "get bucket" option. Once you have the bucket, you lose the "get bucket" option but gain a "drop bucket" and "give bucket to " option. You get the idea.

Never before has a game forced you to play for so many hours in order to do such basic things competently. A certain kind of low-level D&amp;D play is spent fantasizing about how once you get five more levels and buy those three feats with the killer synergy, you will finally be able to play the character you envisioned when you started. And when it comes to unconventional fighting tactics (that are nonetheless mainstays of fiction, such as 'running up the monster's back'), you generally have two results: either there <i>is</i> a rule in the book, and the rule specifically explains how the option is not effective for 95% of all PCs, or there <i>isn't</i> a rule and so you can't actually do what you want to do.<br/><br/>Now that got a little into 'good grief another D&amp;D rant' territory, but what I said about the feats and long-term build trees seems legit to me, when it comes to creating an atmosphere where players are highly motivated to somehow advance to the point where they can actually have all the options they consider necessary to the full fruition of their character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190612/#Comment_190612" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-29T22:37:02+00:00" title="January 29, 2009 10:37PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My Life With Master is very restrictive.

Seriously. This means that what you can try is not restricted, but what you can accomplish is. D&amp;D is great at this -- especially versions pre-4e. You start out a low-level schlub and you fight kobolds and other really weak little creatures. You know you have no chance of fighting anything worthwhile. If a 15th level devil shows up, you run like hell (ha!) or maybe even die without a chance of escape. <br/><br/>Being wimpy restricts what you can do. At 1st level in D&amp;D, you don't know a lot of spells, you don't have good feats for fighting, and your arsenal is free of useful magic items. Then the DM dangles an opportunity for XP and treasure in front of you, and you reach for it, because you know it will make you stronger and less whiffy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190620">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190620/#Comment_190620" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-30T04:39:51+00:00" title="January 30, 2009  4:39AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite>Does anyone have any suggestions for how to create a feeling of restrictiveness in a game?

I think this is the closest to what I'm looking for.<br/>Again, this thought being spurred by Adam Dray's post in the thread about sanity mechanics, my original was about characters that are sane but will go inevitably go insane and for that insanity to be freeing.  I want a way to make being sane to feel almost as restrictive as being locked in a cell.  In the same way a GM might say, to many many things, "You can't do that -- you're locked in a cell" I wanted the GM to be able to say "You can't do that -- you're not crazy" without, you know, having to actually say it.  Or at least without it being pure, unadulterated fiat when he does.<br/>I think this way of only having certain "forms" or "virtues" (or "stats") when your mind is healthy is a good option.  You have to work withing the strictures of society as well as your own mind, so certain courses of action just shouldn't be an option.  You might find ways to work around that to accomplish your goals, but it should be a bit of a pain in the ass.  Once things start to go wrong and your mind starts to break and you don't care about the rules of society any more, new avenues should open up to you.<br/><br/>and of course, if i try to do something like this, i'm not sure whether i really want to do it with insanity... that's just the idea i've had in my mind while i've been thinking about this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Radaghast" title="Radaghast"><img alt="Radaghast" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/252/nT6IX77SIXBAG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Radaghast">Radaghast</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190752/#Comment_190752" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-01T00:30:29+00:00" title="February  1, 2009 12:30AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite><br/>Of course, obviously, that sucks.

It uses cards and a bit of poker mechanics, it's GM-less and every player controls one organisation (megacorp, webforum, ninja village, spaceship, whatever the genre allows). The game goes in turns, and every turn each player has limited choices like "attacking" another organisation, getting more folks into yours, ditching the useless, influencing what's going on in the wild and\u2026 that's about it, if I'm not terribly mistaken. The funny part is how you narrate and get a story out of what happened on your turn.

I imagine we're going to see a lot more of that type of thing soon. I wrote a game for a contest Jason ran in which monsters were defined purely by some words and a number.  So the description reads, like:\n<blockquote>Kayongo is a plague spirit \u201cderived from an ancestor who was a diviner and wishes a living relative to continue his profession.\u201d Twisted by dark science, Kayongo now blasts visions of possible futures into the minds of all those who encounter it, often involving their deaths or the destruction of things they care about. <br/><br/>&amp;#149; \u201cMy Own Future is Dark\u201d x 2<br/>&amp;#149; \u201cI Will Live to See the Ruination of All I Know\u201d x 2</blockquote>\nIn play, then, besting Kayongo requires describing at least 4 distinct things happening, inspired by the plague spirit's traits (two traits, each with a power of 2).  For example, I could describe my character receiving a vision of the future in which he returned home to find his entire family gone and his village burned to the ground, expending one point of "I Will Live to See" (leaving 3 total points of traits left for the monster).  In that game, monsters are not killed so much as endured, which is an interesting model, I think, for monsters that act less like D&amp;D beasties and more like ghosts and other things that fuck with your mind and emotions.  The monsters don't have an impact based on the dice they throw but on how they change the ways in which players describe things happening.<br/><br/>I keep hoping we'll see mechanics more like that in fully fleshed-out and published games, because I may or may not get around to doing it myself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191003/#Comment_191003" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-03T08:55:45+00:00" title="February  3, 2009  8:55AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 3, 2009 8:57AM by fnord3125.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bunnybunny</cite>Yes, that's the point.

But I also never asked for suggestions on creating universal feelings of restrictiveness.  I asked for suggestions on ways to create a system that people would feel is restrictive, or for people to bring up games that they think feel restrictive.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bunnybunny</cite>I'd suggest trad games (like<em>Warhammer</em>,<em>Call of Cthulhu</em>or<em>Vampire: the Masquerade</em>), though, as they generally feel very restrictive. Virtually every single thing the players can or can't do is determined by the GM, though occasionally in-fiction reasons for why exactly things are not possible get invented.</blockquote>Yes, but up-thread I pointed out that I didn't want to create the feeling of restrictiveness by simply saying, "No, you can't do that."  Until the GM starts acting in such a way, I have generally found trad games to feel very open.  Theoretically, just going by the book, your only restriction in Vampire is that you're a vampire.  But you can be any kind of vampire you want to be.  In comparison, if you're playing Dogs, you've got to be a wandering priest/lawman/gunman in a wester Utah-ish kind of setting.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bunnybunny</cite>Also, you didn't answer the question on Chess.

I have this impression you are thinking about some very specific target audience, but it's impossible to sell you on any solutions without knowing what would feel restrictive to those people.</blockquote>No.  Look.  I know feelings are subjective and hence, something that feels restrictive to one person may not feel restrictive to another.  So a game that creates feelings of restrictiveness among everyone that may ever play it isn't possible.  But people also aren't utterly unique in every conceivable facet of their beings.  If it feels restrictive to, I dunno, all the half-dozen people I game with locally, chances are it will feel restrictive to many others as well.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bunnybunny</cite>I'm not sure if I see the difference. In<em>Vampire</em>played by the book you're a vampire in a modern urban fantasy "world of darkness" setting. In Dogs played by the book you're a gunslinger paladin in a western setting. Like in<em>Vampire</em>, whithin this broad restriction you can be any kind of gunslinger paladin you want to be.<br/></blockquote>If you really don't see any difference in those levels of restriction, that may be why we're having trouble communicating.  Saying "You must be a vampire in a modern setting with secret supernatural/horror creatures living in it" is about the same as having a requirement in a D&amp;D game that everyone has to be an elf.  They still get to pick their class, alignment, and presumably have some control over what they will do.  In Dogs, if it were a D&amp;D game, I'd feel as though it were prescribing race, class, alignment, and not only that telling you what you're going to be doing in every session.  And yes, I'm being hyperbolic.  And no, I don't think this is a bad thing.  I think Dogs is very cool, and I wish more of my friends were interested in playing it.  But I do think it has a more restrictive premise than most "traditional" games.  But, and this is the key point for me right here, as long as I've bought into the premise, it doesn't feel restrictive (at least to me) in play.<br/><br/>The same thing goes for chess.  I mean, is chess restrictive?  Yeah, I guess.  I mean, I can't move my knight in a straight line.  But as long as I've agreed to play chess, it feels bizarre to complain that it's "too restrictive" because my rook can't move diagonally.  RPGs (and here's where we're going to have problems.  I suppose that, like Ralph said in the thread on fiat, our personal definitions of RPG may be so dissimilar as to make it impossible to communicate here) are supposed to be different, right?  At least with many traditional games, especially in earlier years, there was this theoretical notion that you can "do anything!" in an RPG.

I kind of like the idea of a game that keeps closing doors over and over again, until the player and character is totally trapped, with no possible options, and then something extreme and catastrophic has to happen to allow them to blow the doors back open again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_192170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192170/#Comment_192170" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-11T19:14:24+00:00" title="February 11, 2009  7:14PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 11, 2009 7:15PM by madunkieg.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been looking over these things, and I can't help but think, what about social/peer pressure?<br/><br/>No one is truly forced to do what their peers suggest. There are certainly consequences for it, but it feels a lot more restrictive than it is, even keeping the consequences in mind. That's because being social is such a strong force in human psychology.<br/><br/>With that in mind, having a good sense of incentives and punishments are a way to push without disallowing other options. Of course, incentives and punishments can be risen above. It's probably hard to bribe Bill Gates with a hundred bucks, but there are plenty of people on the street who would do a little something for that much cash. At the same time, someone who has accumulated power or resources may be able to avoid or not be bothered by punishments. For example, with peer pressure, the risk of not fitting in is overcome by developing relationships with multiple social groups, something that could be played out over time in a game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
