My fantasy mass battle game <a href="http://www.wargamevault.com/product/110359/Mayhem" rel="nofollow">MAYHEM</a> has recently received a <i>power upgrade</i> thanks to Vincent Baker. I've taken the AW mechanic and put a couple of twists on it to allow it power my magic system in a competitive tabletop environment. I'd love to hear what some of you think about it. <br/><br/>If you're a Story Gamer that also enjoys tabletop miniature games, then you just need to be one of the <b>first 3 to respond</b> that you're interested and I'll send you a <b>100% off</b> download coupon for the game.<br/><br/><a href="http://bombshell-games.com/" rel="nofollow">bombshell games</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antisinecurist" title="Antisinecurist"><img alt="Antisinecurist" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antisinecurist">Antisinecurist</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421701/#Comment_421701" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-20T11:04:33+00:00" title="September 20, 2013 11:04AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd take a look, sure.<br/>Been getting interested in some minis games lately.<br/><br/>- AD                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/robb" title="robb"><img alt="robb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/robb">robb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421705/#Comment_421705" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-20T11:44:40+00:00" title="September 20, 2013 11:44AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            v interested.

After you've read through the rules we can have a conversation about how to integrate them into your RPG campaign. There are several options for doing this but some will be a better fit than others depending on which system you are using and how your campaign has progressed. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421712/#Comment_421712" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-20T14:34:58+00:00" title="September 20, 2013  2:34PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd love to hear more about these, but I can't in good conscience ask for the coupon as I doubt I'd have a way to test them properly and give feedback.<br/><br/>Any neat stuff about them you'd care to share, or what went into your design thinking when you were making these?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421717/#Comment_421717" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-20T18:15:07+00:00" title="September 20, 2013  6:15PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dash it all, late to the party!

Each of the characteristics on the core profile are represented by a single die type [d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20] and not a fixed value.  There are no charts or tables used in the game. Melee and ranged combat exchanges are resolved using opposed rolls. However, anytime that you are called upon to roll dice, you may instead choose to take the default; this is equal to half the value of the die type used. So, if using a d12, then you could always opt to take a 6. This holds true for conducting movement as well. If you want to risk it with a little danger, then you can roll instead. There are many ways to get multiple die on a roll that present themselves through good tactical play [attacking an enemy's rear. initiating a charge, etc.]. When rolling dice, you may only keep the result found on a single die of your choosing.<br/><br/>The <i>default versus danger</i> mechanic is combined with the in-game command point economy to make for some interesting choices and modeling of effects during play. More later if you're interested...<br/><br/><b>Command Points and Overdrive</b><br/>There are no phases in the game. Battle is a fluid thing and there are no appointments or specialized times for moving, shooting, or melee. Players alternate taking turns and activating units through use of Command points [Cp]. This makes the game play more like alternating activations than a traditional turn.<br/><br/>Like other values in the game, Command points are not fixed. Command points are generated each turn based on your general's leadership. If your general's leadership is a d12, then you can always take the default for 6 Command points. Of course you can always take a chance and roll. There are ways to get additional die on a command rolls [ like unit standards/banners and heroes].<br/><br/>Overdrive allows a general to push units further, faster, and harder at an ever increasing price. For each action beyond the first that a particular unit takes in a given turn the cost of the action is doubled, tripled, etc. So, if it cost 1 Cp to move a unit, then I could move the same unit three times during a single turn for a cost of 6 Cp [1Cp for the first action + 2 Cp for the second + 3 Cp for the third]. This makes for interesting choices and can allow you to focus your command on a few select units, OR spread your resources across the entire army slowly bringing them into position. Overdrive and the Command point economy also create the framework for time scale distortion [as seen in the Time Stop spell].<br/><br/><b>Soft and Hard Counters</b><br/>As stated above, characteristics are represented by a die type. For example, combat quality [CQ] is the measure of how well a unit performs in melee and takes into account a number of variable including basic weapons, armor, speed, training, and racial attributes. If a unit of typical imperial soldiers has a CQ d12 arming them particular types of weapons doesn't 'buy' them increased damage. Weapon types represent particular fighting styles or advantages against particular types of foes. That's where counters come in. <br/><br/>Counters adjust a unit's characteristic based on the situation or enemy. A soft counter improves the base characteristic by one step- one die type. A hard counter improves the base characteristic by two steps- two die types. Counters are meant to be intuitive and most players have them down after only one or two games. Here's an example of how they work:<br/><br/>A unit of imperial soldiers [CQ d12] armed spears would be a hard counter versus cavalry. This means they would use CQ d8 when resolving combats with cavalry. [Lower die types are better in melee!] This represents the advantage of spears being used in the appropriate role. <br/><br/>A unit of imperial soldiers [CQ d12] armed with great weapons would be a hard counter versus all units when initiating combat [CQ d8], but would fight with the base CQ d12 when not the aggressor. This represents the fighting style of great weapons and advantage when attacking.<br/><br/><b>This means that any advantage that a weapon bestows also scales appropriately with the unit that is wielding it. </b>It's worth noting as well that in the case of melee, combat results are resolved by a single die roll. This not only includes winning or losing the combat, but it also determines how and when harm are applied. This single roll is also used to determine beat backs, drive backs, and other combat effects. <br/><br/>Alright! I'll let everyone digest that bit of text and field any questions before moving on to explore some more features and get to the AW features.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Terwox" title="Terwox"><img alt="Terwox" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/482/nSPMQ33PX1PEF.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Terwox">Terwox</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421751/#Comment_421751" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-21T23:48:25+00:00" title="September 21, 2013 11:48PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool.

This means that you can have as many or few miniatures on a base [in a unit] as you like. The recommended base size for a unit when gaming in 28mm is 60x60mm square bases, but as long as both forces are based the same, then any base size will work. This allows you to get creative and produce mini-vignettes and dioramas if you like. \n<blockquote>I'm looking forward to more info about the *W inspired stuff.</blockquote>\nI thought you might be! I just wanted to give a very broad overview of the core system as it will give a better perspective and understanding on how the *W material fits. <br/><br/><b>The Mundane</b><br/>The non-magical components of the game such as movement and combat have a particular shared set of mechanics and rules that are used for resolution. The use of varied die types as characteristics, hard and soft counters to improve die types, tactical bonuses to gain extra dice on a roll, Command points as a resource, and the default versus danger choice all pull together to represent the world physics. <br/><br/><b>The Magical</b><br/>For me, it was important that magic in MAYHEM to <i>feel</i> different. More specifically, it was important that the act of casting spells, countering spells, and the effort of harnessing magical energies behave differently. The end effects could sometimes use standard world physics when applicable, but the means of achieving said effects should be different. Some design goals:<br/><br/>1. Augmentation and counter casting aside, the <b>casting</b> of magic should be successful on average but not without cost. The universe still seeks balance and attempts to impose order as magic is used to bypass it. <br/>2. The use of magic should be inherently dangerous. The casting of more powerful spells comes with greater danger and unpredictability. <br/>3. The magic system should interface with the core system and feature parallel design structures in key areas to show the influence of a shared ecosystem.  <br/>4. For spells that don't directly cause harm to enemy units, the degree of success of the casting should directly affect how 'successful' the spell's effect is. <br/><br/><b>Sorcery Powered by the Apocalypse </b><br/>Based on the criteria above, I started looking at using the results on 2d6 to get reliable average results and push those to success or failure using magic point modifiers. Without boring you further with how I actually got there, I realized after a while that the mechanic I was creating was pushing further and further towards *W. I quite literally said, <i>'Wait a minute, this is looking suspiciously like DW!'</i> I pulled out my *W material, looked at what I had, and I decided that it would be smarter to reverse engineer the mechanic to work in my game. Here's an overview:<br/><br/>When casting, the player rolls 2d6 and totals the result. This result can be modified by magic points or counter casting, but those points must be committed before the roll. Basic *W rules apply to interpreting the initial result of the roll. <br/><br/>10+ Best result - the casting is completely successful!<br/>7-9  Good result \u2013 the casting is successful, but there are... complications.<br/>6 or less Miss \u2013 a miss is never nothing, but always something worse. Bad things are going to happen!<br/><br/>Since there is no one running the game, on a complications or bad things result the opponent gets to make a soft or hard move [which mimic the soft and hard counter structure]. Since this is a miniatures game, these moves have to be quantified. Some spells may have specific bad things results that are applied. Creating specific consequences as choices for the opposing player is a simple but effective key change. There is still choice, but it is more structured. It's worth noting as well that on average even a successful casting will allow your opponent to act out of turn. There's always risks!<br/><br/><b>Complications result</b><br/>When a 7-9 result occurs, after resolving the casting effect, the caster\u2019s opponent always has the option to take a single action with any one unit in his force. This is referred to as a soft move. This represents the enemy seeing or sensing the chance to act while the caster struggles to use his powers or as bystanders flinch at the backlash or overflow of energies. If the power has a specific complication, then it can be applied instead. <br/><br/><b>Bad things result</b><br/>On the result of a 6 or less, things get ugly! There is no simple missing when dealing with powers such as these. When a bad things result occurs,  your opponent gets to make a hard move. To start with, the magical effect does not occur as intended, and the opponent may take a single action with any one unit in his force [just as if a complication had occurred]. <br/><br/>In addition to taking a single action with any one unit, the opponent may choose to apply ONE of the following effects:<br/><br/>-If it is possible to do so, then the opponent has the option to resolve the effect against the caster, another unit in the caster\u2019s force, or even a unit in his own force. The unit must be in range of the effect. <br/>-If the opponent has casters in his army, then one of them may learn the spell. In a campaign, this spell would be retained for the duration at no cost.<br/>-The caster loses the ability to cast the spell for the duration of the game.<br/>-If there is a specific bad thing associated with a spell or power, then it may be applied. <br/>-The opponent may take a single action with another unit in his army [not the same unit that already acted]. <br/><br/>The complications and bad things results offer up opportunities to explore the narrative of what's happening in the action on the table. A simple complication result and reaction move can tell a story of heroic actions, seized opportunities, and defining moments that go far beyond the simple application of the rules.<br/><br/><b>Results as resolution</b><br/>I alluded to the results of a casting roll being used to determine the relative success of the spell. This happens very organically in play and parallels the type of mechanic used for determining things like beat backs and push backs. As example would be the use of the BLINK spell. The distance a target unit can be teleported is equal to the result of the casting die roll in inches [including magic points spent to augement]. Additionally, spells like summon have special effects if a double 1s or 6s are rolled naturally.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421767/#Comment_421767" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-22T13:10:06+00:00" title="September 22, 2013  1:10PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's very interesting!

That part seems similar. In MAYHEM though, a player may always take the default [half the value of the die] instead of rolling. This can be used to eliminate the randomness of straight line probabilities when a player has a better baseline stat; this puts the pressure on the less skilled unit and gives them the option of either trusting luck or finding a way to gain more dice through tactical placement and teamwork [you can only keep a single die no matter how many you roll]. The math for determining the chances of getting a specific number when rolling a number of dice is beyond most people when in the game, and I find that it makes for some interesting and instinctive choice. Also, there are some interesting things that can happen when the result of a roll is a tie. <br/><br/>Magic does indeed run on the Apocalypse! <br/><br/>It's never too late to get into a little miniature gaming.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421790/#Comment_421790" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-23T07:52:00+00:00" title="September 23, 2013  7:52AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, I <i>love</i> the default rule.

Combined with the resource management aspect of the game [in the form of Command points], it makes for some interesting and tense decisions when taking the default is the smart thing to do based on the odds, BUT a good roll would eliminated a foe instantly and allow for a few more actions that turn. <br/><br/>For those that would like to see an example of actual play, the following pictures will link you to the <i>'Battle for Harrison's Ford'</i> which is a really entertaining pre-expansion material battle report told in three parts.
