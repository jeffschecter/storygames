We had over 20 players, which meant four games in each time slot (except Saturday night, when a parlor larp ate two games' worth of players).<br/><br/>An incomplete list of games played would include:<br/>Race for the Galaxy, Smallworld, Castle Panic, Ryan Macklin Totemic FATE-esque Dresden Files, Paranoia, Montsegur 1244, Nine Roosevelts Against the Impossible, Spirit of the Century, Diaspora, Fiasco, Polaris, Snow White (parlor larp), Dark Heresy, Mouse Guard, Ryan Macklin Drunken Game, and Maid.<br/><br/>We also had two babies; a truly impressive collection of whiskeys, whiskies, wines, gins, and other cocktails; atomic carne asada, bacon, and a whole range of other meats; and ideal weather conditions.<br/><br/>Paul Tevis punched me in the face.<br/><br/>As the last NBP for Nancy and I to run before we move to the Great White North, I'm pretty satisfied. (I'll be even more satisfied if there really is a NBPVII.

It really was a great little short story.<br/><br/>Saturday morning I played Castle Panic!  This game really earns its title and it's a wonderful introductory co-operative board game.<br/><br/>I "ran" a game of Fiasco Saturday afternoon.  It went very well.  We used the Antarctica set and involved a frozen alien body that came to life as part of the Tilt.<br/><br/>Saturday evening I participated in the Parlor LARP.  When Albert first described these I was very curious about them and it paid off in spades!  It reminded me that with the right structural components I really can enjoy LARPing.<br/><br/>Sunday morning I participated in the short but amusing Maid game and of course the AP AP discussion afterwords.<br/><br/>And I topped it all with dinner at Palazzio in Santa Barbara to break up the driving.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267841">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267841/#Comment_267841" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-19T12:47:19+00:00" title="April 19, 2010 12:47PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>We used the Antarctica set and involved a frozen alien body that came to life as part of the Tilt.</blockquote> Surely, a more complete writeup is forthcoming.

For the most part she was always being held by one of her parents or asleep somewhere.  Prudence on the other hand is capable of walking and limited mostly non-verbal communication.  So she was allowed to wander around and "socialize" with us during group times.  She was pretty good at recognizing that the fire wasn't really something to get too close to but she did fall over into dirt a number of times.  Otherwise, she was always with one of her parents.<br/><br/>Oh, also, both sets of parents set up their tents near to the main base of operations so that if the baby was sleeping and something happened they could easily hear it.  Josh was able to participate in the Parlor LARP because it took place in the main base camp and Prudence was sleeping in the tent about 5 feet away.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
