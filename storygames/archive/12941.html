Once the game solidifies further, maybe some legal-sized character sheets (including all moves and spells relevant to a given class) would be good.  I think the tri-folds were a good change for AW.<br/><br/><i>&lt;possibleThreadDerail&gt;</i><br/><br/>So I've only played one session of Dungeon World- at Gen Con with half a dozen folks and a whiskey in hand- so I'm not sure if my experience is representative of the game.  Sage, would you say it has been generally gonzo in nature, or have you seen more nuanced and serious sessions?  Has there been any interesting character development over several sessions, or is the game too young for that?<br/><br/>(I know, it's a dungeon crawl game, how serious can it be? I'm just curious.)<br/><br/><i>&lt;/possibleThreadDerail&gt;</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292227/#Comment_292227" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-08T09:42:37+00:00" title="September  8, 2010  9:42AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We have some ideas around trifold/tabloids or secondary sheets. Some of those ideas relate to the often rumored existence of Advanced Dungeon World.<br/><br/>Steve, that's a tough question. There have certainly been less-gonzo sessions, John Harper had some pretty great stories to tell from PAX that sound about as serious as a dungeon can be, but I'm not sure it's really been that serious. The tone of John's game compares favorably with the tone of most D&amp;D games I've been in, if that makes any sense. Roughly as serious as any classic fantasy can be, but not really dramatic.<br/><br/>I don't think any characters have developed between sessions yet, but there's been some pretty decent within-session advancement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_292262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292262/#Comment_292262" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-08T12:03:54+00:00" title="September  8, 2010 12:03PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gotta say, running headlong into a hallway full of kobolds while on fire was a great personal moment for me. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292270/#Comment_292270" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-08T12:35:13+00:00" title="September  8, 2010 12:35PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that if Dungeon World is about as gonzo as an average game of D&amp;D was when you were a youngin' then we've hit the nail on the head.  Like Apocalypse World, Dungeon World is flavoured lightly by the character books and the rest is a fill-in by the DM and the players.  If you want grimdark fantasy, we can do that.  If you want silly, we can do that, too.  <br/><br/>Con games tend to be short and catchy and it's easy to do that by being light-hearted and silly but, as in all things, your mileage may vary.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
