They would use a variation of the Action Card mechanic I use in Fairy Tale Assassin League. To test it out I did a<a href="http://hamsterpress.net/?p=559" rel="nofollow"> little miniatures wargame </a>on a 19th Century map of the area east of London. <br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://hamsterpress.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/AC2.jpg"/><br/><br/>The game was about a rebel force moving on London from Norfolk. the rebels out numbered the defenders but the defenders put up a spirited defense and won the game. The game was timed by the number of action cards. I used my generic deck but for an actual game I'd make a specialized deck. I didn't get any character story coming out this time but I didn't have individual leader counters to use so that is understandable. The player with the most victory points won the game rather than what was on the board so the movement and shooting were sort of a back drop for what was really going on. <br/><br/>It was a fun quick game of 28 turns (the sides alternated moving and leading off the action). Good solo game play.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
