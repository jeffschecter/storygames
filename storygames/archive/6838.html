Let's start again:<br/><br/>My players are ... special.To be more precise, they actively refuse to read anything bigger then, dunno, Wushu or PtA. Sure, sometimes they <i>say</i> they'll read it, but they practically never do. Now, I've been itching to test-run Spirit of the Century, but I dread to show them the pretty hefty rulebook. While I know it's mostly repetition and detail and the core rules are pretty simple, it doesn't exactly look like a pickup game. And then there is the bigass list of Stunts and the pretty ... intricate rules and, well...<br/><br/>So here I'm asking the bunch of Fateheads here on this forum: How to make SotC a better Pickup game? <br/><br/>Now, Pregens and only the most basic conflict resolution rules would work, but would also be booooring. SotC character creation is awesome, so making pregens when the players could be riffing off each others novels is a waste, IMO. And as far as the rules go, I'm hoping to find a good middle way between ease of play (and explanation) and interesting depth.<br/><br/>Has anybody had experience with running SotC for non-rulebook-readers? Found a way to boil down the rules a bit and yet still keep some interesting interplay? I'd kinda prefer not to act as the GM Rules Blackbox longer then the first conflict or so, so at some point they should know the rules we use.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152231">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152231/#Comment_152231" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-22T09:16:21+00:00" title="June 22, 2008  9:16AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Lord Minx</cite>To be more precise, they actively refuse to read anything bigger then, dunno, Wushu or PtA.<br/>. . .<br/>Has anybody had experience with running SotC for non-rulebook-readers?</blockquote>\nWait.

Read enough that they have a basic idea of what the game is <i>about</i>, how you roll dice and so on.<br/><br/>Basically I don't want to act as the Rules Black Box all the time. I HATE that. I like learning rules, but I really dislike being the only person that has ever looked into them. They don't have to know all the rules, but if somebody is playing a, dunno, Sniper, he should know (or at least have <i>looked</i> at) the Sniping rules. They should know enough that I don't have to explain EVERYTHING and that they know where to look for stuff should they want to know about something.<br/><br/>If they don't know ANY of they rules, they can't use them and then I'm doing all the work again. (And many, especially Dirty Hippy, games pretty much expect players to actively engage with them.)<br/><br/>------------------------<br/><br/>EDIT: But then this misses the point. Making SotC a better pickup games makes it more likely that they learn the rules on their own and makes it less work for me to explain them should they chose not to. And that's what I'm after.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152240/#Comment_152240" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-22T10:03:07+00:00" title="June 22, 2008 10:03AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me, SotC fails as a pickup game for exactly one reason: I can't create suitable villains on the fly. If I have time to think through stunts and traits, I absolutely love running SotC. If I have a good-sized library of baddies to draw from, same thing. But when I have to come up with a tough villain, even a lieutenant, I don't have an adequate grasp of stunts (especially!) to know how to build him quickly and at a suitable threat level.<br/><br/>Len threatened to post up meta-stunt guidelines at some point. You can eyeball some stunt commonalities -- stunts that give you a +2 under certain circumstances, stunts that let you swap one skill for another, etc. -- but if I had a firmer grasp of exactly what was possible stunt-wise, it'd go a long, long way toward making SotC truly a pick-up game.<br/><br/>IMO SotC succeeds admirably as a pickup game with a bit more homework than the rulebook lets on, i.e. making up more developed bad guys beforehand. My absolutely favorite bit of SotC pickup-play advice? <i>Start every scene with a compel</i>. This is so over-the-top awesome that I can't recommend it enough.<br/><br/>LM: If your players have the fundamentals of the fate economy worked out, you shouldn't have to look up anything, like, ever -- print out copies of my fate economy cheat sheet and you should be set. At least in theory. There are a handful of situation-specific rules I have to look up all the time, though: chases and explosives both come to mind.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog" title="Z-Dog"><img alt="Z-Dog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog">Z-Dog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152241/#Comment_152241" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-22T10:10:19+00:00" title="June 22, 2008 10:10AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lord Minx,<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can, get one player on your side as your wing man.

Just explain the character creation step by step as you do the steps. Then use the stunt packages at the end of the book to establish some niches for each character and round it up with another stunt or two in different areas. Don't read every stunt for them, do it like this:<br/>\nYou: "So, Bob, you got sneaking around nicely covered with your first three stunts, in which of your skills do you want more stunts?"<br/>\nBob: "Hmmm I got high fists and high deceit..."<br/>\nYou: "Yeah... well... either hit them in the face or do it talky talky like... your decision"<br/>\nBob: "I feel like hitting stuff"<br/>\nYou: "Ok... lets get you some stunts for that then."<br/>\nIt takes 10 minutes tops to chose some stunts and explain the mechanics of them per player, at least that was the case in my last game. They don't have to get an overview over all stunts and make an informed decision. They need some stunts that fit their concept and move on.<br/>\n<br/>\nMechanics... stick to basic task resolution, fights, aspects, consequences and wing the rest. It is not like you need every heist rule perfectly in action in your first game and in my experience you usually come pretty close to the actual rules by winging it. They are well written that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit: And if you really want to use it as a pickup game create a couple (say 10 or so) main bad guys in advance.

(aka Pilot can fly Jet Black's jetpack instead of Engineering)<br/><br/>* They add a new trapping to a skill. (like allowing Science to be used for medical treatment, which no other skill normally has)<br/><br/>* They add two shifts of effect to a specific application of a skill's trapping. This can be a straight +2 if you want, but it can also apply to any expenditure of shifts - time, subtlety, quality, etc. (like the Photographic Memory stunt on page 117 of the rulebook, which lets you reduce the amount of time any research takes by two units if it's reasonable that your character would have read about the same subject matter somewhere before)<br/><br/>* They break one game rule, which includes those in the text and others assumed by setting or consensus. (like the Art stunt that lets you do assessment actions on a target when the target isn't present, but a piece of their artwork is)<br/><br/>That's the list.<br/><br/>Regarding the original subject matter of the thread, I'll be the first to admit that "pickup" may not have been the best choice of terms for describing SotC's design, falling into that trap of having variable connotations depending on whom you ask.

Found a way to boil down the rules a bit and yet still keep some interesting interplay? I'd kinda prefer not to act as the GM Rules Blackbox longer then the first conflict or so, so at some point they should know the rules we use.</blockquote>\nWhen I ran it for some people at work, I was GM Black Box for the first couple of encounters. I had a fight, and explained how to fight as we played. Then there was a chase, and explained those.  But we made characters in the traditional way, which took the usual two hours.<br/><br/>And then I've run a con scenario, and for non-rulebook readers, this is how I'd do it (combined with the above method of just explaining things as they come up).<br/><br/>Make partial pre-gens with four aspects and two stunts, and as many skills filled in as you want, at least enough to tie in to their aspects and stunts to give a clear idea of "what this character is about."  I usually leave 5 skills blank, and usually at the bottom of the pyramid.  If a 1:1 ratio of pregen to player is too limited or boring, do 2:1 or 3:1 or even 4:1.  Attached to each character, give them a list of 5-7 stunts, including the description of how the two stunts they have work.  Make pre-reqs clear (arrange trees together, and by skill).  So, instead of a list of a hundred stunts many of which wouldn't fit their character, they have less than 10 to pick from, all of which fit their character.<br/><br/>So, they pick their characters, do the novels, and then fill in stunts and skills. Prep time is about a half hour or so and then you're good to go.  And you really only need to do it once, unless you like to change characters with every new story.  If someone can't decide on a skill or stunt or even Aspect, then go into Play As You Go mode with their partially completed character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152467/#Comment_152467" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-23T14:07:47+00:00" title="June 23, 2008  2:07PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Lord Minx proclaimed:</cite>The most basic stuff would probably be just the resolution mechanic and simple opposed rolls, but like I said earlier, that's probably too basic. At least, I'd want to bring in Zones/Movements, Maneuvers and such, but then I have the whole thing at the table soon-ish.</blockquote>\nHere's how I boil it down:<br/><br/>The core mechanic of SotC is stating you want to do X action, rolling your dice against a difficulty or another person, adding your skill to the roll, and seeing if you tied or won. If you did, you get to do X action. If you did really well (aka got shifts), extra stuff happens.<br/><br/>In a fight, you're going to do one of four things on your turn:<br/><br/>* Attempt to affect your opponent directly (attack)<br/><br/>* Attempt to gain a situational advantage (maneuver)<br/><br/>* Attempt to prevent something from happening (block)<br/><br/>* Attempt to reposition yourself (move)<br/><br/>That's it, really. When you're in a fight, you should be thinking about your action in terms of one of those four things. Everything else is largely irrelevant. For each of those actions, context tells you if you're rolling against an opponent or, like in the case of maneuvers where you affect the environment instead of the target, against a fixed difficulty.<br/><br/>Also, you know what extra stuff happens if you get shifts on the roll - attacks do damage, maneuver aspects 'stick', you might get spin from a block, and you get to move further. <br/><br/>Overflow is just a matter of making sure none of the players' shifts are wasted on a roll. If they do something, roll well, do their thing, and have some left over... let 'em do something else if they want. Otherwise, don't worry about it.<br/><br/>Best way to explain maneuvers: "So, you know how D&amp;D has that chart of modifiers that's all like 'target is prone' and 'target has 50% cover' and that kind of thing? SotC doesn't have that chart, because it has maneuvers. You make up what advantage you want, and roll to see if you can get it. If you do, it makes an aspect you can use to represent the advantage. First use of that aspect is free, too."<br/><br/>About zones: If you, the GM, aren't going to divide your scene into zones, mechanically based movement becomes entirely irrelevant. So that's an easy out. If you are, be as simple and obvious as possible about it - fight's in a bar? Zones are the parking lot, the bar, the back room, the backlot. Done. Fight's in the air around a zeppelin? Above it, below it, behind it, and in front of it are your zones. Done.<br/><br/>About supplemental actions and combining skills: Really, you probably don't have to worry about these all too often if you don't want to. They're just tools to let you model an additional level of complication. When a player goes, "I snatch the idol up off the ground and get the hell out of there!" it lets you say, "Okay, well, I don't think that's quite two actions, so roll Athletics at a -1 penalty." If the PC's hanging off of a ledge and trying to shoot someone on the opposite roof, it lets you say, "Well, your Athletics is only Fair, and you're having to hold yourself up here, so your Guns roll is at -1." They're really just formal ways of justifying those kinds of judgment calls.<br/><br/>I think that about covers the basics.

Right now, what it looks like is that when you roll for the maneuver, if you tie the difficulty (aka get no shifts), you just get the one free tag and it goes away. If you get shifts, it's sticky, and persists until someone takes it down by rolling against your shifts.<br/><br/>So suppose you're in a gunfight in a bar, and you're all like, "I need some cover here." There are tables and crap everywhere, so I'm all like, "Okay, Athletics, difficulty is Average." You roll a Superb. That's four shifts. So, you can keep pinging that "Cover" aspect (first is free, subsequent ones cost FP like normal) until someone else spends an action to go, "Hey, I'm just going to pump a bunch of rounds into the table he's hiding behind and destroy it," or "I'm going to position myself so he has to retreat from his cover," or whatever. And they'd have to roll something, and because you got four shifts, they'd have to roll a Great to remove it in one roll.<br/><br/>And I'm thinking right now that you can roll several times in a row, in subsequent rounds, to remove a maneuver that someone placed and spent a bunch of fate points on. So if someone hits you with Disarmed, but rolls high and invokes two aspects on it and gets a Legendary, you don't have to worry about having to beat that in one to get your weapon back.<br/><br/>Basically, I've done this to create a mechanical parallel with attacks and remove the context dependency. Shifts on attacks do higher stress, shifts on maneuvers make stickier aspects.\n<blockquote>I really like many of SotC ideas, but damn, sometimes I feel like it doesn't know what it wants to be.</blockquote>\nSometimes I feel that way, too. Fred, Rob, and I went into SotC with this sort of "write it like we play it" kind of attitude, which served as both a benefit and a drawback in some ways, because we each ran the game a little differently. So, conceptual shear occurred in parts where each individual's vision brought something different to the text. <i>The Dresden Files</i> has a stronger editorial direction and focus, and my hope is to, well, simply do it better this time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152843/#Comment_152843" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-25T00:55:56+00:00" title="June 25, 2008 12:55AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Landon Darkwood</cite>I'm actually in the process of clarifying/rewriting this for<i>The Dresden Files</i>.
