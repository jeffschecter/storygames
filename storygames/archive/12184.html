For it to make sense, you have to know that a French sociologist named Roger Caillois produced a typology of play in his book <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man,_Play_and_Games" rel="nofollow">Man, Play, and Games</a></i> in which he described play as comprising four different elements, including agon (competitive games and sports), alea (games of chance or fortune), mimesis (games of make-believe), and ilinx (playful vertigo). I wondered if the Big Model's notion of Creative Agenda could be usefully reconstructed with Caillois's types, and it turned out that some other folks had similar thoughts. So I posted this right before Andy pulled the plug on the thread, but he said it'd be cool if I reposted it in a new thread.</i><br/><br/><b>Part One: Why Bother With Alternatives to GNS?</b>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite><br/>I especially agree that while challenging the existence of CA seems ludicrous to me, I could well imagine alternative or even more useful descriptions of of the entire field than GNS. . . . because Creative Agenda has many parts that can be tickled better or worse by different approaches -- different techniques. I'd like to say that the best thing I get out of GNS is that once I'm able to clearly verbalize that I want to do premise-ful play or whatever, that allows me to set aside all the other vistas and focus better on the smaller nuances that were never available to me when I spent all my time trying to negotiate the big basics.</blockquote>\nYes, exactly. The notion that descriptions of CA like GNS should be at root pragmatic game design tools strikes me as dead on. The further implication is that, because of the multiplicity of possible agendas for play, any particular description of "why people play" or "what people get out of playing" serves a normative function as well, helping to create the culture of play it purports to describe--at least insofar as people subscribe to it as a guide to design and play. This is as clear a case of the reflexivity of knowledge as one could ever hope to encounter.<br/><br/>In the case of GNS, one thing that it does very well--as Eero rather astutely points out--is call attention to a mode of play that it calls "narrativism." When you think about it, you realize that this mode is actually rather obscure, a kind of play that works by having one stand in a kind of alienation or distance from the character one plays in order to more strongly appreciate the moral weight of the decisions the character makes--this in contrast to the strong identification with character that is the desideratum of immersive play and the elision of character that is the hallmark of competitive play. <br/><br/>One side effect of this way of slicing up the phenomenon, as people use it to explore the design space that results, is that purely gamist designs become interesting as a way of examining the negative space of narrativism--in other words, of challenging the basic assumption of narrativist play and saying, hey, what if there's no character, not really, it's all just a contest between us here at the table, via the medium of a set of rather elaborately detailed pawns. It recapitulates the hoary old narratology versus ludology debate in a new form.<br/><br/>But another side-effect is to make "simulationism" inexplicable, or even pathological. I remember seeing a post on Vincent Baker's blog to the effect that while he understood gamism and he understood narrativism, simulationism struck him as puerile wish fulfillment power fantasy at best. I seem to recall the subordination of simulationism in some other context having driven David Berg to distraction, given his efforts to make sense of and reclaim the term. And I think the reason for that is that once you make yourself aware of the distance between player and character, and use that as a tool in your designs, then you have a tough time with a mode of play in which minimizing or hiding that distance is a sine qua non.<br/><br/>So in devising an alternate set of CAs, the answer to the "why bother" question (i.e., "why bother coming up with an alternative to GNS?") has to be in order to reveal a different space for play, or to open up new possible avenues for design, or minimally to render us more sensitive to the alternatives that may exist.<br/><br/><b>Part Two: Reconstructing Creative Agendas</b><br/><br/>What follows should be read with an eye on Eero's remark that the absence of narrativism from Callois's scheme has to be attributed to the paucity of "premise-ful" modes of play in the instances of play he examined, and that were he around today he'd surely incorporate that into his scheme. In other words, our theories should be constructed in light of the empirical evidence available. On the other hand, I always assumed that the reason that Caillois identified four categories--rather than three or five, say--had something to do with the linguistic structuralism associated with the Paris School of Semiotics, in which a huge semantic space is produced by the conceptual entanglement of opposites. So a "positive" term implies (the existence of) a corresponding negative, like yes implies no. But those terms can be "entangled" as both yes and no (i.e., "maybe") and as neither yes nor no (i.e., "I don't know"). Similarly, agon (skill) implies its opposite alea (not-skill: luck or chance). And those opposites can be entangled such that "both agon and alea" can be understood to mean mimicry, as successful mimicry is at once a skillful (albeit not wholly competitive) performance as well as a willingness to subject oneself to the dictates of fortune. By the same token, ilinx is clearly "neither agon nor alea" in that the dislocations or dissociations one experiences in ilingic play obviate both skill and luck. <br/><br/>Now, in this post-structuralist era, we don't believe that our categories are in any way essential or fundamental; they are analytic conveniences only.<br/><br/>So what happens if we imagine agon, alea, mimicry, and ilinx as the corners of a semiotic square? First of all, we notice that the underlying distinction in both the agon-alea and mimicry-ilinx pairs has something to do with the activity of the player; in the former, the player is active while in the latter the player is passive, in the sense that he or she is the object of the forces acting in the game, whether that\u2019s the turn of the wheel of fortune or the elasticity of the bungee rope.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.personal.psu.edu/wjw11/Caillois%20CA.png"/><br/><br/>Secondly, we notice that the underlying distinction in both the agon-mimicry and the alea-ilinx pairs seems to be that the former in both instances presume the unalloyed agency of the player whereas the latter see the player as part of the field of play. In other words, whereas in both agon and alea you play the game, in both mimicry and ilinx the game plays you. You adopt a new persona, take on a new role, feel scared or excited, or otherwise lose control of yourself.<br/><br/>But these dualities are capable of being entangled, and we can use those entanglements to rebuild the CAs. We\u2019ll follow Eero in suggesting that the combination of agon and alea is the Contest, in which players are interested in victory as the outcome of play. Conversely, the combination of mimicry and ilinx is Drama; players are interested in experiencing thematically resonant moments as the outcome of play. So far we\u2019ve reconstructed the Gamism/Narrativism dichotomy in slightly different terms.<br/><br/>Looking at the orthogonal dimension, starting with the combination of agon and mimicry, I\u2019d suggest that the appropriate metaphor or model is the Pageant, where players are interested in the skillful performance or faithful recreation of alternate roles. Its converse, the combination of alea and ilinx, is the Thrill Ride, in which players are willing to subject themselves to external control in return for the promise of a powerful or pleasant emotional experience. The effect of this, I\u2019d say, is to reconstruct Simulationism as a kind of \u201cagonistic mimicry\u201d that stands in the same relationship to \u201cImmersionism\u201d as Narrativism does to Gamism.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273121/#Comment_273121" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-26T08:55:29+00:00" title="May 26, 2010  8:55AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Zac in Davis said:</cite>Yes, Bill, I am thoroughly impressed that you managed to find a home for all four modes of play wrt to Caillois, and I'm equally impressed that I was able to follow what you were saying about semiotics - literary theory has never been my strong suit. <br/><br/>I'm glad that you have constructed a more contextual view for Right to Dream, here - the role of immersion/Immersionism has long been a big question mark in debates about Sim, even though the Scandinavian scene has always told us "You guys don't do immersion like we do!" Imagining seven-day LARP sessions in a Swedish campground makes it clear to me that ilinx can definitely have a role in RPGs, beyond the emotional dislocation that can accompany a particularly intense bout of Story Now. <br/><br/>One thing that does come to mind - I recently read someone's suggestion that Sim "should be" better described as the quest for Discovery. In light of this Caillois/Edwards theoretical mashup, I think Discovery *could* count as ilinx, at least if one takes the definition of it pretty broadly. And yet, I don't think there's room for the collective imagining of new places in this model - strictly speaking, that isn't mimicry, is it?<br/><br/>When a friend of mine gets all excited about reading up on the nine worlds of Nine Worlds, that doesn't seem to really be about a faithful recreation of anything per se. The Pageant seems to be taking a shot at explaining the Emulation side of Sim, where we find genre, specific licensed properties, and physical causality being faithfully rendered. <br/><br/>But that's different from the imagining of new worlds altogether - since that's undoubtedly a dislocating experience and it opens one up to something larger, I could see it falling definitely in ilinx, and mayyyybe in alea, but, at the same time, it doesn't seem to share much with what I had conceived of as an example of Thrill Ride play.<br/>Thoughts?</blockquote>\nWell, what kinds of imaginings of new worlds are we talking about? Some sort of collaborative world-building might count as "agonistic mimesis" to the extent that players get rewarded for successfully contributing usable elements to the fiction; think <i>Universalis,</i> perhaps. Were I to defend this model of CA, I'd have to argue that the difference between licensed-property emulation and new-world-imagining is one of scope rather than kind, since the ground rules for our game of make-believe are simply further reaching in the latter case than in the former.<br/><br/>The larger point, though, is that this reconstruction of creative agenda sees them as mixes of Cailloisian types, with different proportions being possible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273125/#Comment_273125" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-26T09:09:08+00:00" title="May 26, 2010  9:09AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Incidentally, Bill, "agonistic mimesis" will either be the name of my band someday, or the name of my firstborn child. It's too awesome to know for sure.<br/><br/>Anyway, I think your response has helped me refine my question and its concrete basis a little bit - we throw around the phrase "lonely fun" at my local gaming group, and I think that reading setting material for games constitutes a form of it. If a friend of mine absolutely adores poring over setting material, and that clearly is a source of major entertainment, then I guess that begs the question, "Is pleasure-reading a form of play?" I think that if the actual creation/discovery of a new setting is mechanized in a game, then it fits into existing categories.<br/>What I was driving at in my earlier question was really about pleasure-reading wrt new setting materials. <br/>Lastly, I am beginning to think that what is meant by Discovery is really just another word for Exploration - it occurred to me that any dungeon crawl, regardless of its mechanics, has a high "discovery" factor in the events of play. Given, though, that almost always the physical setting where scenes occur is Color, nothing more and nothing less, it seems to me that that's not enough to hang a Creative Agenda on. <br/>If you have heard the Discovery argument and disagree, I'd be interested to hear your thoughts. Or if you agree, but care to elaborate, as well ^_^                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273129">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273129/#Comment_273129" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-26T09:32:45+00:00" title="May 26, 2010  9:32AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bill,<br/><br/>I really like the positive-negative pairings, and the active/passive and roll-play/role-play observations.<br/><br/>I have some criticisms to offer re: your CAs.

Thus Drama as a CA has to at least incorporate GNS-style Narrativism, albeit perhaps as a sub-type within a broader suite or spectrum of approaches to play. As a combination of Cailloisian types, Drama is "ilingic mimicry" (or mimetic ilinx, perhaps) so that it's the <i>exact opposite</i> of the Contest. So whereas the Contest sees the player and the player's in-game persona as unproblematically identical, in the Drama they are related in a more complicated way, such that there is the possibility of dislocation or alienation. So the ambivalence you feel toward your character in a game of <i>Kill Puppies for Satan</i> indicates you're in a Drama-oriented game. A more purely mimetic game might amount to a kind of cosplay; a more purely ilingic (ilincial?) to a jeepform game that subordinated story to "technique."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273146/#Comment_273146" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-26T11:01:28+00:00" title="May 26, 2010 11:01AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 26, 2010 11:04AM by David_Berg.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bill,<br/><br/>Narrativism and stance aside, may I take that as a "Yes"?

My whole argument is that in doing so you actually end up making "The Story" this artifact that sits on the table that everyone kind of wrestles over.  Play becomes a lifeless intellectual exercise.<br/><br/>The heart of my ideas is that for stronger more powerful Story Now play one should construct a character that is burning with issues of deep personal importance to the player himself.  As example here is a character I would never build:<br/><br/>Lieutenant Smith knows that his best friend since high school and fellow officer is dealing drugs at the local boot camp.  Smith's commanding officer has just put him in charge of investigating the drug supply problem.<br/><br/>Pretty weighty character right?  He's rife will all kinds issues about friendship and hierarchical authority and the like.  So he must be perfect for Story Now play, right?  Not for me.  I have absolutely no personal investment in these things.  I would probably watch a movie about this guy.  It might even emotionally move me.  But there's a difference between CONSUMPTION and CREATION.  I have no problem consuming a story about this guy because I trust the creators will fill the emotional gap I have through effective communication via the medium.  But if you put me in charge of actually creating this guy's story, I'd do a pretty poor job beyond my intellectual understanding of his issues.<br/><br/>On the other hand here IS a character I've created.<br/><br/>The character was a young prince who had an older sister.  She was about to become queen and had royal suitors from foreign lands.  Also the young prince's best friend was love with the young prince's sister but he was of too low a station  to be worthy of marrying the would-be queen.  My character pretty much could not handle this.  He wanted his sister to abdicate and marry his friend.  He wanted the three of them to run away from the kingdom so they could be friends forever like they were as children.  The result was that he grew more and more, obsessive and more and more over-protective of his sister.  In the end he tried to kidnap her but he failed and was forced to go into exile.<br/><br/>THIS character I have intense emotional identification with.  I have a deep personal connection with The White Knight Complex (i.e. a man's desire to protect and rescue the women in his life).  I do not deal well with changes beyond my control.  I am an only child and have always felt the lack of siblings, in particular I have always wanted a sister.<br/><br/>If you want to know just how close to home this character is I will say this: This situation partially mirrors a rather difficult real-life situation I was dealing with at the time.  Even CLOSER to home, the other party involved in the real-life situation was an active player in this game.  She knew full-well what this situation was a metaphor for and she had enough trust and faith in my creative honesty to actually HELP me develop this situation for my character rather than perceive it as an attack.  Quite frankly she was the perfect player to have at the table because she could provide exactly the right kind of adversity I needed to fully tackle the issues at stake for my character.<br/><br/>I can't really imagine any stronger character identification than that.  When people tell me that they find Story Now, "distancing" the only conclusion I can draw is that it is because, to them, high identification Story Now must seem frightening.  And, quite frankly, it is.  In Story Now play the issues are "live."  There's no guarantees or safety nets which means that if you are personally deeply involved in those issues the opportunities to get hurt are quite numerous.<br/><br/>But it's in that pit of living writhing personal issues that I like to play.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273169/#Comment_273169" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-26T12:25:17+00:00" title="May 26, 2010 12:25PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 26, 2010 12:37PM by Levi Kornelsen.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A harder criticism:<br/><br/>In a traditional RPG (say, D&amp;D) where my character has to jump a chasm, knowing the rules for jumping the chasm can map onto me thinking not in, but <i>near</i>, my character about whether or not I can make the jump; in this instance, the same rules elements that could support Agon or Alea are used to support a sense of Mimicry (although it's not quite the same as the "real thing").<br/><br/>This goes all the way around - almost any element can be put into the service of any other.

I'm not really grokking how Ilinx is a superset of Agon and Alea or how Mimesis lacks them.  So, the general question (which is hopefully easy enough to address): While it seems relatively simple to declare a positive word (seme) and it's negative it isn't at all clear how one would settle on the complex and neutral positions.  And more pointedly to the above, Agon and Alea are examples of resolution, so why isn't the complex seme "resolution" or "outcome methods" or something?  And the neutral seme would be...what?  What is play without resolution...maybe Ilinx makes more sense there, actually?

I think part of the strength of GNS as theory is that, if you have a CA, it is either G <i>or</i> N <i>or</i> S.  The thing that keeps people coming back to play falls into <i>one</i> of these types of goals.  You're doing imaginative exploration either for its own sake, or to address premise, or to win, the end.  No hybrids, no fourth option.  For all the limits inherent in chopping up all the infinite possible Creative Agendas into a small number of categories, if we can't draw hard lines between them, I'm tempted to say "Why bother?"<br/><br/>So, my critique is that your 4 CA types don't look that distinct, and the lines between them don't look that hard.<br/><br/>Let's say I love playing in my Pageant game.  The Pageant-ness of it is what keeps our group coherent and coming back for more.  What does that mean?  Does that mean that we're high on how Mimicry and Agon uniquely interact?  When my group finishes each play session and decides, "Yes, we want to do <i>this</i> again next week," it's only because we love proving our mettle <i>and</i> identity exploration?  We're definitely not just doing it for one or the other?  We don't just prove our mettle en route to identity exploration (the real point), or explore identity as a means of proving our mettle (the real point)?<br/><br/>Your CA categories seem more motivationally complex to me than "story now" and "step on up"; and in this case, I suspect that simpler is better.<br/><br/>-David<br/><br/>P.S. Separately (mostly): I think "skillfull performance" of the type you suggest in Pageant play is not agon at all, but is present in all roleplay, as the standard by which we appreciate each other's contributions.  It's the successful execution of <i>any</i> CA.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273177/#Comment_273177" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-26T12:51:03+00:00" title="May 26, 2010 12:51PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 26, 2010 12:54PM by lordgoon.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite><br/><br/>So, I don't know if you've ever seen my blog Play Passionately but it's pretty much dedicated to tearing down this notion that you, somehow have to "distance" yourself from the character to achieve effective Story Now play.

The notion of detachment is a tricky one when you're talking about any art form, but one of the great things about RPGs (and perhaps theatrical acting to an even greater extent) is that they provise us with a means of being thoroughly <i>un-detached</i> from the concerns of fictional characters, even when they bear very little resemblance to what we ourselves regard as "burning issues." There are limits, of course - although they're quite well-written, I find it impossible to empathize with the hero of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_turner_diaries" rel="nofollow">The Turner Diaries</a>, and I have problems getting excited about <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> for some of the same reasons. And I'd have a tough time playing Lieutenant Smith too, but mainly just because I've known very few druggies and most of my attempts to talk in military-speak would be riddled with embarrassing cliches. But I'm totally confident that I could have a good time RP-ing a guy I know who spends all of his time traveling up and down the West Coast making money as a street performer. Do I actually want to juggle and sing Bob Dylan songs to strangers on the beach for eight hours a day? I'd rather drink dishwater. <br/><br/>Would playing a game as a facsimile of this guy be an act of "consumption" or "creation?" I think one of the interesting things about simulationist gameplay is that it stands right on the cusp between these two notions. Mimicking the behavior of another person is an act of consumption in an almost literal sense, but I don't think anyone would deny that if I was really good at it, I'd deserve to be called a creative artist.<br/><br/>Actually, I guess maybe people who believe in the ideas associated with "Method" acting would deny that this sort of mimicry could count as aesthetically valuable. But their views always struck me as an almost perfect misunderstanding of what makes acting (and RP) a worthwhile exercise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273178">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273178/#Comment_273178" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-26T12:55:18+00:00" title="May 26, 2010 12:55PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>The Author and Hero in Role-Playing Games</b><br/><br/>The idea that there's a variable distance between the player and character in an RPG (broadly construed) that depends on how you approach the game is more controversial than it might appear at first, since you'd expect the assertion that "you are not your character" would be accepted without demur almost everywhere. Not so fast, though! It's possible to argue--and it has in fact <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=10238" rel="nofollow">been argued here at Story-Games</a> that only gamers worry too much about the distinction. The position that you both <i>are</i> and <i>are not</i> your character in a way that's mediated by the game in question is taken by Luke Crane at the end of that discussion.<br/><br/>So when I talk about "distancing" I'm talking about the position the game takes with respect to the question, "Are you your character?" The answer is usually going to be "Yes and no," and the specific configuration of when yes and when no is an important element of game-play. Even if you've never heard of the literary critic Mikhail Bakhtin,  who talks about the way the author can manipulate the authorial distance between the character and himself or herself to create a meaningful narrative effect, the idea that the author isn't the character but is in some fashion <i>responsible</i> for the character (in all the different ways we can mean "responsible") won't be alien to you.<br/><br/>There's an old discussion on the Forge (503 Service Temporarily Unavailable at the moment) where Ron Edwards talks about playing kpfs and being struck by the experience of play. You create this unattractive pimply loser character who is essentially an ineffectual jerk at the lowest rungs of the hierarchy of the damned, not trusted enough to commit anything other than the most banal of evil acts. And you play that character, who both is you and isn't you at the same time, and in the end if you're lucky you feel some semblance of sympathy despite your disgust for this character because, well, <i>you made him</i>. <br/><br/>Ultimately, I think this is point of what I'm going to call Drama-oriented games: to in one form or another appreciate the character not as an alter ego but as a fictional one. In a Contest-oriented game, there may in fact be no character as such; I have a "character," but it's primarily a tool for playing the game: think the sort of D&amp;D dungeoncrawl where you say "we don't need no steenking role-playing here." Call it stance if you like, but it implies a fundamental orientation to the game rather than mere ornamental technique.<br/><br/>Another way of dealing with the player/character gap, though, is to minimize it. At Knutepunkt in 2009, I listened to a talk by <a href="http://johannakoljonen.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">Johanna Koljonen</a> on the tools larpers use to deal with the "hole" produced by the fact that player has far fewer in-character cognitive resources than the fictional character would were the character real. One I remember I particularly liked, she called "filling the hole with stupid." She talked about these Nordic larpers playing German guards in WWII. They didn't speak German for the most part, but they could be taught a few words and phrases: "Waffen haben," "Cigaretten haben," and so forth, using these to inhabit the characters as their fairly limited alter egos.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273180/#Comment_273180" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-26T13:01:58+00:00" title="May 26, 2010  1:01PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 26, 2010 1:02PM by Levi Kornelsen.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>So when I talk about "distancing" I'm talking about the position the game takes with respect to the question, "Are you your character?"

I have fond memories of the story about the prince who couldn't let go of his sister.<br/><br/>I can understand, on the other hand, valuing the sensation of becoming "lost" in a character.  This might sound negative but I don't intend it to be that way: It's kind of like getting high on your own brain chemicals.  A borderline hypnotic or trance state.  You're not really valuing the character as an entity at all that point.

I think that's pretty easy, and we should be able to discuss this point without getting bogged down in limits of character identification.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273210">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273210/#Comment_273210" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-26T15:11:14+00:00" title="May 26, 2010  3:11PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Weeks</cite>Bill, this is my first exposure to the Semiotic Square, but I've studied the<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotic_square" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia article</a>on it, and I have a concern about your application above.  I'm not really grokking how Ilinx is a superset of Agon and Alea or how Mimesis lacks them.  So, the general question (which is hopefully easy enough to address): While it seems relatively simple to declare a positive word (seme) and it's negative it isn't at all clear how one would settle on the complex and neutral positions.  And more pointedly to the above, Agon and Alea are examples of resolution, so why isn't the complex seme "resolution" or "outcome methods" or something?  And the neutral seme would be...what?  What is play without resolution...maybe Ilinx makes more sense there, actually?  Or maybe I'm approaching it all wrong.</blockquote>\nThis is a real methodological concern. I will cop to playing fast and loose with Greimas's method, but only on the authority of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredric_Jameson" rel="nofollow">Fredric Jameson</a>, who recommends stealing the bits and pieces you like, although he lets us call it bricolage. The <a href="http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-176374804/structuralist-alchemy-kim-stanley.html" rel="nofollow">approach that I usually take</a> involves reconstructing a system of distinctions created by someone else. In other words, once you've established the essential opposition between your simple positive and simple negative terms (e.g., "yes" and "no"), identifying the complex terms ("maybe" and "I don't know," e.g.) is usually a matter of figuring out the underlying shifts of meaning used by those who employ the terminology. And usually that shift involves an underlying dimensionality, like the shift between certainty and uncertainty in the example I've been using.<br/><br/>I think I'm doing something similar here, in reconstructing Caillois's typology as a semiotic square. The exact sticking point as you recognize is in identifying mimesis and ilinx as the complex positive and complex negative terms respectively. In this case I have to admit that I'm relying on linguistic introspection rather than anything more rigorous, but bear with me.<br/><br/>When we start with agon as the simple positive term, we're implying the existence of not-agon; agon's opposite. I take that to be equivalent to alea because of the way that I recall Caillois talking about them, where agon involves an active striving and alea a passive reception of fortune. That's the essential duality. Now we have to explode it; we have to imagine the thing that is both agon and not-agon, both active striving and passive reception, and we have to find the term in the universe of discourse that we're reconstructing that most closely matches that concept. Find that, and you've found the complex positive term.<br/><br/>I want to assign that position to mimesis and the complex negative position to ilinx because of the parallel shift from activity to passivity that I see in each pair. Agon : alea :: mimesis : ilinx. The player of make-believe exerts his or her imagination in the same way as the chess-player exerts his or her rational faculty; the lottery ticket buyer subjects himself or herself to the operation of fortune in the same way as the sky-diver subjects himself or herself to the operation of gravity.<br/><br/>So we have two parallel pairs, and they seem to line up along this dimension of activity/passivity. Now the question that we need to ask is how are they <i>different</i>.  Now, Caillois doesn't talk about role-playing, but I recognize in agon/alea the idea of RPG as game (i.e., a contest) and in mimesis/ilinx the idea of RPG as non-game. The most straightforward way of understanding that dimensionality is the difference between role-playing and roll-playing. And that to me seems to suggest a concern for how one orients oneself to one's character as the underlying semantic dimension.<br/><br/>So that's my justification for laying out the semiotic square the way I did. Note that I'm only begging and borrowing those bits and pieces of Greimas that I find fruitful, rather than adopting the whole complex mess.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273212/#Comment_273212" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-26T15:26:14+00:00" title="May 26, 2010  3:26PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And now, my long-promised description of "Sim as Discovery" - - courtesy of Valamir at the <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=12181.0" rel="nofollow">Forge</a>.\n<blockquote>Simulationists view conflict as an opportunity for Discovery and to answer the question \u201cwhat if\u201d.  Discovery touches on the very nature of simulation, which is at its core a grand experiment.  The experiment is to set a course of events in motion and observe what happens.  This requires strong commitment to the in-game causes and established thematic elements within the SiS because in order to be a valid simulation, each element of Exploration must be true to its nature or else the answer to the \u201cwhat if\u201d question will be a false one.<br/><br/><br/><i>Expanding on Simulationism</i><br/>Simulationism has long been a problematic agenda to understand.  In my effort to more clearly define it I have elected to replace the Right to Dream with Discovery, not as an additional term, but because I think Discovery more accurately relates to what Simulationism is about.  In my opinion, the Right to Dream is what all of role playing is about and is thus more accurately applied to Exploration than to Simulationism.  Dreaming is a rather passive endeavor.  But Discovery requires decisive action and focus and is more appropriately on par with the other two agendas.<br/><br/>I have also tried to return Simulationism to its roots which have been lost in the mists of ancient Forge discussion.  The goal of Simulationism must be, can only be it would seem to me, to simulate something.  Not to explore, not to just \u201csee what\u2019s out there\u201d.  Those are passive acts of observation.  Simulation is like an experiment which seeks to answer the question \u201cwhat if\u201d.  Before one can observe the results and get that answer, one has to set up the experiment and start it in motion.  That is the active piece of Simulation in my mind.  The conscious commitment to not just observe events but, through ones character, to be the catalyst for those events.<br/><br/>Consistency, verisimilitude, in-game causality, these are all aspects of Exploration that are held in common in all three Agendas.  What constitutes an acceptable level of consistency, verisimilitude, or in-game causality for any given set of Setting, Character, and Situation is determined by Color (as agreed to by System).  These elements are given special emphasis in the course of a Simulationist Agenda only to the extent that they are necessary and for the purpose of providing an accurate context for simulation.  As an experiment designed to answer the question \u201cwhat if\u201d, the parameters of the experiment must be carefully controlled.  In a chemistry experiment these parameters include temperature, pressure, precisely measured quantities of ingredients, etc.  If any of these are off, then the experiment is off and the results are false.  In a role playing simulation these parameters can include tight restrictions on player knowledge (to prevent biasing the experiment), and a rigorous approach to ensuring that each element of Setting, Character, Situation, and Color remains strictly true to its nature.  Unlike Narrativist play where addressing Premise may require the intentional challenging of this nature, such a challenge is inappropriate to Simulationist play unless that is the variable being tested in the \u201cwhat if\u201d experiment.  If it is not, then those elements must be held as constants for the experiment to be valid.<br/></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273218/#Comment_273218" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-26T16:12:57+00:00" title="May 26, 2010  4:12PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps I'm too dense to see it, but while what is being discussed here might be an interesting and fruitful way to talk about games, I don't think it's got much to do with anything I recognize as CA.<br/><br/>This is almost exactly technical agenda - the preferred types of techniques that are used to create the fiction, not the creative intent of the fiction.

On the other hand, if you correlate "Discovery" with play that is focused on running a simulation, then that is a particular subset of Right to Dream.  Right to Dream also includes games like Toon, where it's a bit of a stretch to think of oddball aesthetics as simulation parameters, and to think of generating humor as a "what if?" exercise.  <br/><br/>Perhaps this is all the more reason to have two categories.

I think part of the strength of GNS as theory is that, if you have a CA, it is either G<i>or</i>N<i>or</i>S.  The thing that keeps people coming back to play falls into <i>one</i> of these types of goals.  You're doing imaginative exploration either for its own sake, or to address premise, or to win, the end.  No hybrids, no fourth option.  For all the limits inherent in chopping up all the infinite possible Creative Agendas into a small number of categories, if we can't draw hard lines between them, I'm tempted to say "Why bother?"<br/><br/>So, my critique is that your 4 CA types don't look that distinct, and the lines between them don't look that hard.<br/><br/>Let's say I love playing in my Pageant game. The Pageant-ness of it is what keeps our group coherent and coming back for more.  What does that mean?  Does that mean that we're high on how Mimicry and Agon uniquely interact?  When my group finishes each play session and decides, "Yes, we want to do <i>this</i>again next week," it's only because we love proving our mettle <i>and</i> identity exploration?  We're definitely not just doing it for one or the other?  We don't just prove our mettle en route to identity exploration (the real point), or explore identity as a means of proving our mettle (the real point)?<br/><br/>Your CA categories seem more motivationally complex to me than "story now" and "step on up"; and in this case, I suspect that simpler is better.</blockquote>\nThis is some serious shit right here. There are two things I need to do. The first is little; the second, big. <br/><br/>The little thing is that I want to change my earlier answer to David, since it leads to attempts to understand the top-level CA categories as a little bit of agon and a little bit of mimesis mixed together, and that's not what I meant. So the short answer to that question--"In your model, the CAs posited are essentially combos of 2 Callois types? And that, for those combos to define play at the CA level, the Callois types must apply to play's primary rewards?"--is clearly no. Better to say that Caillois's types serve in combination as the conceptual underpinnings for the CA categories that I've posited. They're ideal types in the same way as the GNS categories are.\n<ul>\n<li><b>Contest (aleatic agon).</b> The players play to win by striving against each other and the vicissitudes of fortune.<br/></li><li><b>Pageant (agonistic mimesis).</b> The players play to play by skillfully engaging with the make-believe and its underlying principles.<br/></li><li><b>Drama (mimetic ilinx).</b> The players engage with the diegesis (the game-world) in an effort to create thematically resonant fictions.<br/></li><li><b>Thrill Ride (ilingic alea).</b> The players engage with the game in an effort to experience emotionally resonant moments.<br/></li></ul>\nThe big thing I need to do is address the why bother question. I tried to do that a little bit in my long post above, but it's worth talking about more. I claimed that GNS privileges Narrativism, and I'll stick by that. I'll admit that this is <i>also</i> a normative theory; its goal is not to diagnose dysfunctional play but rather to try to identify new ways of thinking about why we play, and thus how we could play sometimes if we wanted to. It's possible that the thing that David sees as a problem with this theory--the blurriness of the boundaries between the CAs--is actually a <i>strength</i>; it serves to explain how groups can sort of muddle along.

That relates some of my own experiences back to me quite well - - CA's *are* squishy categories, and we know this from our experiences of play as being a lot more vague and muddy in practice than it appears on the written page. Moments when theory really shines through are, well, shining pearls in the midst of so much of the mud of play. The phrase "groups can sort of muddle along" resonates a lot. If I want to play Pirate Ship on the jungle gym, that doesn't stop my friends from just climbing around for the heck of it, but if I wanted to play tag, and all they wanted to do was climb around, that'd be disruptive. That's the problem of CA differences in one sentence, imo. <br/>And yet, to my mom over on the park bench, we're all clearly playing together. My attempts at a rowdy game of tag might get me hollered at, but other than that, we can all share the play space together without getting too much in each other's faces. I guess what I'm taking away from this, Bill, is *how* similar or same CA preferences can differ with one another - in what ways we can both have more in common and yet further nuance our differences meaningfully.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273237/#Comment_273237" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-26T18:47:03+00:00" title="May 26, 2010  6:47PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would like to point out that "are you your character" isn't always as strange a question as you may think.

If two characters were in a relationship, some players assumed automatically that the players ALSO now were in a relationship.  I kid you not!  I had to tell a player once that, even though our characters were dating, it didn't really mean that she and I had anything going on.  She didn't really get it.

But my experience looking over actual play and trying to discern "G or N or S?" has suggested to me that the easist way to get an answer is to arrive at <i>the singular priority</i> that underlies all the momentary play decisions and trumps all the lower-scale priorities when push comes to shove.  This is hard enough to do when the singular priority is in fact one simple motive.  Turn it into a combo of two motives (or a very complex single motive), and I'm a little daunted.<br/><br/>Your bulleted list of definitions strikes me as closer to being diagnose-able.  But, if I'm not already viewing the Calloisian types as the CA types' starting points, the Calloisian types feel tacked on.  I mean, if someone showed you <span style="color: #000088;">"<b>Drama</b>. The players engage with the game-world in an effort to create thematically resonant fictions,"</span> and then asked you to describe it via Callosian types, would you say, "clearly, it's mimetic ilinx"?  I sure wouldn't.<br/><br/>I suspect diagnose-ability is a key criteria for a new CA typology, given the value of relating theory to actual play.  But I could be wrong.  Diagnosis using GNS is far from clear and easy.<br/><br/>Sorry to be purely negative rather than constructive here.  There's a lot of stuff about your model that looks very appealing.  I simply suspect that a more fruitful way to relate Callois' types to a CA typology might be found.  Alas, I'm not yet sure what form that might take.<br/><br/>-David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273250/#Comment_273250" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-26T21:36:39+00:00" title="May 26, 2010  9:36PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is awesome stuff.

As you may recall from our discussions in Norway last year, I've been playing around with the idea of more direct matching. If we take ilinx (in the sense of <i>becoming-other</i>) as the core of all liminal role-play, and the other three as necessary components of the gameplay, the GNS preferences would manifest as follows: Gamism is of course a strong emphasis on agon, simulation on mimicry, and the highly debated and debatable immersion(s) a dive towards the ilinx component. Narrativism is, of course, the tricky part. The way I see it, it's essentially <i>anti-alea</i> - a fight against the chance component for the purpose of what is seen as a stronger story.<br/><br/>From this perspective, your square and the combinations it implicates is a clear argument towards fruitfully acknowledging the hybrids Edwards has been so keen on denying. Keep developing that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273268/#Comment_273268" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-27T03:23:46+00:00" title="May 27, 2010  3:23AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 27, 2010 3:25AM by Deliverator.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jiltuomas's post reminded me of a question I had: would it even make sense to talk about a CA where you were playing purely in one of the corners, instead of all four (or six; I really like alea-mimicry and agon-ilinx, the latter in particular definitely reminds me of some very intense boffer games I've been in) mixtures?  I'm thinking "no" but am having trouble justifying that intuition.<br/><br/>ETA: David, I think the more-difficult-to-grasp nature of this theory is actually one of its strengths in that its complexity also makes it more nuanced.  What's (one of) the main objection(s) to categorizing CA in terms of GNS?  It's too reductivist, it elides too many complexities.  I think Bill's new theory avoids that problem, but in so doing is necessarily a bit more challenging.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SheikhJahbooty" title="SheikhJahbooty"><img alt="SheikhJahbooty" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SheikhJahbooty">SheikhJahbooty</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273273/#Comment_273273" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-27T04:53:15+00:00" title="May 27, 2010  4:53AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            These don't seem to me to be alternative creative agendas, but rather methodologies of play.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf my creative agenda is to tell an exciting story, Drama, Pageant, Thrills, and Contests all seem like they could play a part.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf my creative agenda is to have fun playing a game, Drama, Pageant, Thrills, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this isn't an alternative to the way GNS looks at creative agenda.

But I don't get the impression that that's Bill's current endeavor; it looks to me like Contest/Pageant/Drama/Thrill Ride are meant to be taken as distinct categories, not as markers along a continuum.<br/><br/>I'm not clear on everything we'd lose by ditching hard categories.  I've already mentioned actual play diagnosis.  I think there may also be a matter of identifying CA Clash, of enabling players to say, "Hey, we <i>really</i> don't want the same thing out of this game, on a <i>fundamental</i> level that can't be patched with some new techniques."  Saying, for example, "Well, we both like Mimicry, let's focus on that, and turn down the Agon that you hate, and turn down the Ilinx that I hate," sure sounds like a matter of technique-patching to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273351/#Comment_273351" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-27T13:32:21+00:00" title="May 27, 2010  1:32PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bill,<br/>\n  Regarding your OP. I dunno, in one sense, this seems to be a good break down.<br/>\n  Once you decode it. I hadn't heard of Cailois and had to consult wikipedia to figure out what "agon, et al." were.<br/>\n  I think the one thing that GNS/GDS does right is that the terms are fairly intuitive. I say Gamist, and in your mind you have a good starting picture of what that means. I say Illea and some people have to go to wikipedia to even have a basic understanding...<br/>\n<br/>\n  Second, I like how you are framing this diagram/concept in real play experiences/discussions.<br/>\n  But, I think putting roleplay vs rollplay right in the diagram is being more provocative than productive. Also, Active vs Passive can be taken the wrong way. I mean no one I know sets out to be passive. They may fall into a passive pattern or be out "actived" by another player. But, I don't think that any players are more or less comfortable in the active vs. passive role as long as they are not being put on the spot...<br/>\n<br/>\n  Don't get me wrong, I think I get what you are trying to say (and if I understand you correctly, it is pretty cool!). I just think that if you choose words with less pre-conceived notions/negative connotations, you will get more mileage from your model...<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div

I thought I understood your CAs when they were single words or Caillois-combos, but your elaborated definitions are throwing me. The "thematically resonant fiction" one is giving me a lot of trouble (is this an effort to incorporate the "premise-ful play" of GNS-Narr?). It also seems to me that thematic resonance is likely to induce emotional resonance, which would make these CAs hard to distinguish in practice if I only had those definitions to work with. Also, is the distinction between the game and the game-world critical? I would have thought that the pressure that DITV's mechanics provide to escalate conflicts would be Drama-encouraging, but since that is "game" rather than "game world" is it a more Thrill Ride encouraging mechanic? Or am I misusing your terms?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273497/#Comment_273497" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-28T14:45:42+00:00" title="May 28, 2010  2:45PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It may be a little too early to make any judgments about the utility of this model. After all--not to make any invidious comparisons--the Copernican model was actually <i>worse</i> at predicting the position of the planets in the night sky when it was first developed than was the Ptolemaic system it eventually superseded.<br/><br/>Of course, that brings up the point that these aren't scientific theories about a natural phenomenon; they're humanistic accounts of a social one. And that means that they are <i>reflexive</i>, in that to the extent that they are accepted by participants in the phenomenon, they shape those participants' experiences with and understanding of that phenomenon. For example, if we play together and have a bad time, if I accept the Big Model I am more likely to say to myself, "Huh, that guy has different aesthetic preferences than I do," than "Huh, that guy is an idiot," whereas if I don't then the reverse is true.<br/><br/>But it is <i>not true</i> that the only way the Big Model locates problems in play is at the level of incompatibilities between players in terms of their aesthetic preferences. So even though the first place people tend to go when a game session doesn't work is CA, maybe the problem lies elsewhere. Maybe it's a social contract-level problem (i.e., people not getting along). Maybe it's an exploration-level problem (i.e., the diegesis isn't compelling). Or maybe it's a technical problem (i.e., the game is broken). It takes a fairly thorough description of the game session and then a sensitive and sophisticated reading of that description to really make sense of what's going on when a game session doesn't work.    <br/><br/>Anyway, it's not entirely clear to me that I want to be in the business of diagnosing dysfunctions in play. You see how much joy that has brought to Ron Edwards' life. The task at hand is to see what happens if, unsatisfied with GNS within the broader Big Model of Forge theory, we adopt a Caillois-inspired typology of Creative Agenda.<br/><br/><b>Caillois's Modes of Play In More Depth</b><br/><br/>If the agon-ilinx and alea-mimesis pairings make sense to a lot of people, then I have either (1) misused them by placing them in a semiotic square (because terms across the diagonal are supposed to be <i>contradictory</i>, in contrast to terms on the same horizontal, which are <i>contrasting</i> or <i>opposing</i>, and terms on the same vertical, which are actually <i>complementary</i>) or (2) explained them poorly. I'm going to go with <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> for now, especially since in looking back I see that the definitions are sort of buried in the earlier thread.<br/><br/>I don't have Caillois in front of me, but it's not the case that he intended to mean "alea" and "agon" as merely resolution mechanisms; rather, he defined them as modes of engaging in play. To play agonistically is to compete, to strive to win, to place one's will in contention with another's. In contrast, to play aleatically is to surrender oneself to the vicissitudes of fortune, to accept the judgment of chance as right and true beyond the reach of skill, intellect, or prowess. I said the underlying dimension seemed to be active vs. passive; it's more appropriate to say active vs. <i>receptive</i>.<br/><br/>Similarly, mimesis is imitative, make-believe, a <i>mirroring</i> of someone or something else; to play mimetically is to actively pursue some imaginative end. In contrast, to play ilingically is surrender to some consciousness-altering force or circumstance: jump out of an airplane to feel the rush, or spin around so that you feel dizzy. Thus, while both involve a consciousness-shift of sorts, mimesis is active and ilinx receptive in the same way that agon and alea are active and receptive. <br/><br/>In the diagram above, I played a little fast and loose with the underlying dimensionality of the shift between the agon/alea and mimicry/ilinx pairs, calling it the difference between roll-playing and roll-playing. It's more precise to say that agon-alea is egocentric, being focused on the self or the particular identity of the player (so you could say it's <i>ludiocentric</i> or player-oriented if you wanted to avoid the negative connotations of egocentrism). In contrast, mimesis-ilinx are <i>fingocentric</i>, which is a word I made up to mean "contrivance-centered"; they don't regard the player as this monadic entity that wins or loses but rather as something mutable, pliable, or changeable via play.<br/><br/>So, in this view, agon and ilinx are incompatible because one is active and ludiocentric and the other receptive and fingocentric. You can't both actively strive for the supremacy of one's self and at the same time be receptive to its alteration; nor can you actively alter your self while being receptive to fate's judgment on your monadic identity. At least, I seem to recall Caillois talking about play in those terms.<br/><br/>But my attempt to cram Caillois's modes of play into a Greimassian semiotic square is reflexive in the same way as GNS is. Other views on how to use Caillois to make sense of RPGs are certainly not pre-empted by this one; our friend Jiituomas has proposed an alternative that sees role-playing as fundamentally ilingic: we seek consciousness alteration, and use the other modes of play as needed to get us there. This is a compelling view, and one that's more interesting than regarding RPGs as pure mimesis, which some scholars are wont to do.<br/><br/><b>Expanding the Semantic Rectangle</b><br/><br/>But there are two semiotic squares in the diagram above; the outer square entangles the inner terms not as contingencies (e.g., the intersection of agon and mimesis is the Pageant) but as a whole new field of meanings that draw upon but are not wholly defined by the interior square. So, whereas the inner square is a typology of <i>modes of play,</i> which I take to mean the basic orientation of players to the act of play, the outer square turns out to be <i>frames of play</i>. In other words, the terms in the outer square imply some of the social role and behavioral expectations that exist when the game is framed in that way. For example, a Contest implies the existence of competitors who are expected to oppose each other directly and adversarially, It also potentially suggests the presence of a judge, referee, or umpire. Some contests have spectators, who may or may not be partisan. <br/><br/>Similarly, a Pageant may have competitors, but their engagement with each other is not via direct antagonism; instead, they simply enact their stage personae for the edification and delight of onlookers, winning via the formal and informal plaudits those who judge.<br/><br/>By the same token, a Drama will have actors who enact personae within the play (of the game), but that enactment is intended to reveal something about the character being played rather than to demonstrate the skill of the actor ("Genius!"). Why bother revealing things about a fictional character? Why, indeed? It has something to do with producing meaning, I guess.<br/><br/>Thrill Ride play is less interested in creating meaning (i.e., in "saying something") than it is in crafting an experience. The best example I can come up with of a Thrill Ride game is the jeepform GR. One player is the victim of an assault; the others are its perpetrators. The perpetrators must describe what happens; the victim describes what people feel. The result is a visceral lesson in power and its abuse. In that game, feeling comes first and meaning comes later, if at all.<br/><br/><b>Moving Forward</b><br/><br/>It's my hope that if nothing else this model (or model section, if you like) can be used as a device to imagine new ways of playing, to spark a new idea about how to handle a particular game, campaign, or scenario. I think it also points to a broader critique of the Big Model, but that's too much to get into. To the extent that one needs a tool for diagnosing problems in play, this model could help by pointing to the tensions within a particular frame. For example, the Contest is characterized by the tension between skill and chance, between the necessary agency of agon and the required receptivity of alea. Too-demanding skill requirements or the subordination of skill to luck against expectations can frustrate players. In contrast, the tension in Pageant play is between ludiocentric agon and fingocentric mimesis; problems can arise if player performance is over-rewarded or under-acknowledged, or if characters are inadequately developed and portrayed.<br/><br/>I've tried to address as many comments as possible in this post; let me know if I've glossed over something that you think deserves more attention.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273535/#Comment_273535" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-28T19:44:37+00:00" title="May 28, 2010  7:44PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 28, 2010 8:04PM by David_Berg.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bill,<br/><br/>Those specifics make all the difference.  <br/><br/>I've read tons of Simulationist play discussion, but very little of that has covered the importance of being and having an audience, or of the balance between losing oneself in character versus participating in the virtuous cycle of "well played!" acknowledgements.

This happens constantly.<br/><br/>Even Callois' stated diametric opposition isn't absolutely rigid; the card game Fluxx, for example, provides types of fun that map almost perfectly to Paidia and Ludus, which are absolutely supposed to be opposites re: Callois, and moves between them in a way that depends on your moment-to-moment stance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273549">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SheikhJahbooty" title="SheikhJahbooty"><img alt="SheikhJahbooty" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SheikhJahbooty">SheikhJahbooty</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273549/#Comment_273549" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-28T23:23:52+00:00" title="May 28, 2010 11:23PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Moving between them" is not the same as "being both at once".

I think it brings to light some important axises (Is that a word?) <br/>\n<br/>\nOne axis, receptive versus active. You cannot talk and listen. I think it's like the difference between Call of Cthulhu, and Sufficiently Advanced. In Call of Cthulhu I must be receptive to what's going on in the game. It's scary. My character could be taken away from me very easily through death or insanity. That's the point. In Sufficiently Advanced I should be active in creating what's going on in the game, trading plot twists, using my plot scores to add stuff to the game, take stuff away, make stuff happen that has absolutely nothing to do with my character.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd another axis... I'm not sure exactly. But I think it might have something to do with character, questions like, "Is the character simply a playing piece allowing the player to interact with the rest of the game?" "Is the character more detailed, but the player is still expected to play with the best interests of the character in mind?" "Is the character more detailed and the player could legitimately lead the character to his doom without the game punishing the player?" "Is the character detailed and the player must, according to the rules, lead the character to his doom?"<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I am off base, then correct me. I am a total noob at this. For example, I did not even know that GNS was at all useful for identifying dysfunctional play. And now that it's been pointed out to me, I still don't get how it would work. Like if I want an exciting story (N) and my friend just wants to rack up the XP (G), and we're playing Palladium, don't we both win, because the biggest XP awards go to the most impressive acts of daring do?<br/>\n<br/>\nDo not hijack the thread explaining this to me. If you care and you have a good explanation, just email it to me. (My nick is also my yahoo ID.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's an idea. Maybe we can identify where a bunch of real games go on these diagrams, where they fit in, in this new paradigm, and why. Maybe it's a chart with an x axis and a y axis, or maybe its a big ring. Maybe some games would take up two or more places, like Levi pointed out for Fluxx. That might help people understand what you're trying to measure, and what gaps exist in the diagram, like places that games haven't examined much up until now, and maybe its because they're no fun or maybe its because nobody thought of it until you laid it out like this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273552/#Comment_273552" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-29T00:43:49+00:00" title="May 29, 2010 12:43AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: SheikhJahbooty</cite>"Moving between them" is not the same as "being both at once".

My first question is whether or not it's worthwhile keeping the rest of the big model and trying to make this fit in place of GNS or to start with Caillois and build from there.<br><br>As for my own thoughts and questions, I'll start with Agon.<br><br>Agon - who is the opponent?  When Caillois wrote about Agon, he seemed to be considering games were one person competes against another.  Outside of RPGs, we have one vs one, one vs many and many vs many.  Some have noted that with the advent of computer controlled opponents, one can have a one vs none as well where none is a non-person competitor.  In D&amp;D 4E, the DM is functioning more like a computer programmer than an opponent.  The DM's role is explicitly stated to present challenges to the players, but not to try to be victorious over them.  In some sessions I've seen players compete with one another about how effective they are when facing these challenges and compete that way, despite being on the same "side."  Or perhaps the better question is that if you are about to engage in Agon type play, what process will be used to identify one's opponents and to identify how one goes about being victorious over them?<br/><br/>I know in the video game design headspace, there's often a distinction made between hard agon and soft/easy agon.  Where the victory over the challenge is either dared oo incidental.  The original Tomb of Horrors is definitely hard agon.  It's basically Gygax daring people to try to get through that particular meat grinder.  Soft agon seems to be more present in 4E module design (Irontooth being an exception).  The challenge in the currently published D&amp;D modules is so low compared to previous editions of the game.  It's almost like pure Agon is not the point.  Also, soft agon is often talked about as the agon present when other elements like mimicry or ilinx become more and more present.<br/><br/>Nicole Lizarro (player experience consultant in the video game industry) coined the term "Fiero."  Fiero is what a player who is victorious in games of hard agon gets out of the experience.  It's the emotional pay off of anxiety being built up until the player has triumphed over a great challenge.  Similarly, she calls the emotional goal of soft/easy challenge, "Curiosity."  The player's attention to something is why they play.  In this type of agon, the challenges would be there because the meeting of them produces some information, feedback or objective that is the true goal of the player.<br/><br/>So in what ways is how "hard" or "soft" the agon is in a particular game important to a theory of play (and design?)?  What are the implications?  Is this in any way useful to what you're talking about here Bill?                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_274216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274216/#Comment_274216" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-03T04:22:33+00:00" title="June  3, 2010  4:22AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2010 4:24AM by Bill_White.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>1) You explained well what "contrivance-centered" is<i>not</i>; could you explain more what it<i>is</i>?</blockquote>\nIt's hard, because it's mainly defined in opposition to ludiocentric (player-centered). In ludiocentric play, it's possible to easily ascertain victory or defeat for any given player; in fingocentric play, the players' contribution does not easily lead to such judgments. It's the difference between chess and cats' cradle as forms of play. In chess, each move I make reflects back upon me as a player in contention with you; in cats' cradle, you and I are just playing around with a circle of string that we're contorting into different shapes as we pass it back and forth. Our attention is focused less on how our individual moves reflect on us as players than on the thing we are creating or "contriving" together, as ephemeral as it may turn out to be. In an RPG, that might be the fiction or "diegesis," or it might be the psychological experience of play.<br/><br/>So there's a way of playing D&amp;D in which it's ludiocentric--I made it to 20th level! I'm awesome! Conversely, there's a way of playing D&amp;D that's fingocentric--My character is 20th level! He's awesome!<br/><br/>I think maybe that in ludiocentric play, agency is located with the player; that is, the player is in control, at least in the sense that his or her moments of choice mark significant points of play. In fingocentric play, conversely, the player is "decentered," and may even occasionally be the <i>object</i> of play. I haven't played <i>Lacuna</i> yet, but I suspect that there's such an instance.\n<blockquote>2) Thrill Ride as described seems asocial to me.  How do participants reward each other?  Can play integrate "Whoa dude, I'm so immersed right now!  Are you?" interactions, or would that break the "losing yourself" experience?</blockquote>\nAll of the general types I've presented are probably best understood as social frames that shape the social roles enacted by those who participate in them. The metaphor of a "thrill ride" implies two major roles: the Conductor and the Passengers. I'd argue that "Passengers" are <i>receptive</i>, like an audience, rather than asocial. And there are definitely old-school traditional GMs for whom the role of "Conductor" would be dead-on. I suspect that the Thrill Ride frame permits its participants to acknowledge the skill with which their feelings and emotions are affected--perhaps after the game, just like applause. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Vernon R</cite>This issue highlights a strength of the GNS formulation though it's one that's often missed.

Ron stated it as something like "why I want to play with this group of people in this game" and it's not a monolithic thing that describes every moment of fun in your game.</blockquote>\nThat's true enough, but it's actually a subtler point than you let on, given how many folks understand a group's GNS as merely the sum of its individual players' preferences. To a certain degree, GNS encourages this misconception, by offering as its fundamental explanation of problematic play the idea that the cause is probably incompatible GNS creative agendas. Right? I mean, the Big Model admits the possibility that maybe there were social contract problems and so forth, but Creative Agenda is the only part of the model where there's an actual causal model stipulated. In other words, CA incompatibility is the only Big Model diagnosis for which there's a cure.\n<blockquote>A groups creative agenda is the impetus for how and in what way the in game situations change.  Does it move forwards as a reaction to the ethical choices made (Nar), based on how well the players performed (Game) or to meet our preconceived notion of what this game experience is about (Sim).  I tend to think of a groups CA as a type of Social Contract and I dont think it's even necessary for an entire group to be all that interested in the activity as long as they accept it.  You can have a player who is there purely to ham it up and not really engage with premise as long as he is respectful of the groups goal and works with them or at least doesnt get in the way.</blockquote>\nThe idea that the Big Model operates at the level of the group over one or more sessions of play (i.e., "a complete reward cycle") is actually one of the hardest things for people to get. I'd suggest that the model I'm proposing works similarly.\n<blockquote>At this point it looks to me like this idea is working on a different level compared to GNS in the big model.  Is it trying to describe the preferences of a single participant?  How does it relate to group dynamics?</blockquote>\nI'm not proposing a causal model; I'm proposing a definitional one, a <i>semantic structure</i> that partakes of how we understand what it means to play. Thus, the inner square reflects the "dimensions of play": the things that we understand to be encompassed in play. But those dimensions are then conceptually "entangled" to produce what turn out in the outer square to be a set of archetypes or "scripts" for playful activities--exactly the same group or collective level that you see the Big Model operating at.<br/><br/>In other words, a Contest is a group activity with, minimally, two Contestants; a Pageant has, minimally, a Performer and an Audience; a Drama, an Actor; a Thrill Ride, a Rider. But they each have room for far more participants enacting a wider variety of roles; not everyone has to be an Actor to participate in the Drama. So at this point, I see this outer square operating at exactly the same level as you see GNS operating in the Big Model: a kind of social contract that shapes participants' understandings of what they're about.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: SheikhJahbooty</cite>This is to say, I like the square. I think it brings to light some important axises (Is that a word?)</blockquote>\nThe plural of "axis" is "axes" (usually pronounced "AX eez").\n<blockquote>One axis, receptive versus active. You cannot talk and listen. I think it's like the difference between Call of Cthulhu, and Sufficiently Advanced. In Call of Cthulhu I must be receptive to what's going on in the game. It's scary. My character could be taken away from me very easily through death or insanity. That's the point. In Sufficiently Advanced I should be active in creating what's going on in the game, trading plot twists, using my plot scores to add stuff to the game, take stuff away, make stuff happen that has absolutely nothing to do with my character.<br/><br/>And another axis... I'm not sure exactly. But I think it might have something to do with character, questions like, "Is the character simply a playing piece allowing the player to interact with the rest of the game?" "Is the character more detailed, but the player is still expected to play with the best interests of the character in mind?" "Is the character more detailed and the player could legitimately lead the character to his doom without the game punishing the player?" "Is the character detailed and the player must, according to the rules, lead the character to his doom?"</blockquote>\nYeah, I think this is right. It's absolutely about the relationship between player and character, the degree and kind of <i>alterity</i> imagined to exist between player and character.\n<blockquote>If I am off base, then correct me. I am a total noob at this. For example, I did not even know that GNS was at all useful for identifying dysfunctional play.

All the other guys were interested in killing things and taking their shit, and they were actually high-fiving each other when they murdered a bunch of helpless kobold babies. I didn't say anything, but then they got mad at me when I wanted to role-play buying a helmet from the armorer in the town smithy. What's going on here?" then you will be asked to describe what happened in more detail and, depending on your answers, it might turn out that the rest of the group has a Gamist CA going on while you are expecting a Simulationist agenda.\n<blockquote>Here's an idea. Maybe we can identify where a bunch of real games go on these diagrams, where they fit in, in this new paradigm, and why. Maybe it's a chart with an x axis and a y axis, or maybe its a big ring.

You say, "My character is going to try to talk him out of it." The dice hit the table and it becomes obvious that you will not win this conflict. That's OK. The dice say you lose, so that's the way the story is going to go. You'll ride it out, see where this goes.<br/>\n<br/>\nLame!<br/>\n<br/>\nEscalate, dude! If you bothered to be in this conflict it should be worth bringing at least one other trait into it. Fight! Be resourceful and creative when bringing traits into conflicts, finding ways that seemingly inapplicable traits could help you. Make your own destiny, even if it leads to your character's doom (veering more towards mimesis than agon).<br/>\n<br/>\nWell played Dogs will always be in that space between Agon and Mimesis, Pageant.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrue 20, though. You roll the d20. You make the DC, or you don't. Agon could play a part in your fun. You could front load your rolls with bonuses,  but once the die hits the table, you pretty much have to accept it. Once the die lands, you are along for the Thrill Ride. Plus, character's in True 20 earn experience points that you lose if your character dies. So the area that True 20 occupies in this scheme is going to be near Alea. If you lead your character to an appropriate (in terms of character or story) doom, you would be penalized. This keeps the game away from role play. (Compare that with Dogs where character don't advance so much as change, and can change for the worse.) If you want to seek victory, you have a narrow window in the game for doing so. This tends to make play less about agon. (Compare that with Dogs, where a bad roll can lead eventually to victory if it means enough to you for you to fight for it.) But it doesn't take agon totally out of the equation.<br/>\n<br/>\nGames can certainly take up a range of places in this analysis, or a spectrum of places. But it is not true that all games can be played in all of the ways presented.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_274875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274875/#Comment_274875" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-07T13:12:07+00:00" title="June  7, 2010  1:12PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 7, 2010 1:14PM by David_Berg.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bill,<br/><br/>Thanks for your answers.  I love the distinction between "player-centered" and "fiction-centered", but I think those names work better for the concepts than "ludiocentric" (which is so close to play-centered) and "fingocentric" (which has me drawing a blank).  If non-hyphenation is a vritue, then something like homocentric (it's about the humans) and mythocentric (it's about the stories and models) would make me happier than your two.<br/><br/>Your description of the roles in a Thrill Ride make me want to explore how these social frames might help determine the <i>shared</i> aspect of a creative agenda.  I'm used to thinking "gamist play rewards skillful performance, narrativist play rewards effective story-making, and Right to Dream play rewards contributions to a certain aesthetic experience", and I wonder if any such simple formulations can be found for your four CAs.<br/><br/>What the heck, I'll take a stab:<br/>Contest play rewards skillful performance<br/>Drama play rewards thematic resonance (though I'm not sure where ilinx comes in there)<br/>Pageant play rewards captivating portrayal<br/>Thrill Ride play rewards unselfconscious experience<br/><br/>Hmm.  Well, maybe it's a starting point.  I'm not thrilled with the degree of overlap here; I hope someone else can do better.<br/><br/>I suspect this is a decent first foray into the utility of these categories.

I ask not to intend it as it. I am trying to keep the lest technical I can on philosophical terminology, and also trying to be the less compulsive I can while writing. Which are possibly the two hardest challenge for me.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>Sure, yes. Bring on the critique; let's see how defensible this model is. -- Bill</blockquote>\nWell... as far as I see it, it's non defensible because it is built on a... "quite creative" interpretation of Callois' theory.<br/><br/>It is completely wrong to take Callois in any topic regarding Creative Agenda, because Callois analysis is formal, while Edwards' one is related to a group of persons performing a social activity and it's functional.<br/>Formal = how game is made.<br/>Functional = how people relate to games.<br/>Further, what Callois call the Ilinx, the Vertigo, is the type of gaming activity the physically produces a vertigo, like bungee jumping and kite surfing, going on a roller coaster, or having fun from the use of drugs. This vertigo aims to alter one's perceptions (of time and space...) to a physiological degree.<br/><br/>The only point of conjunction between Callois and Edward lays in what the french sociologist called Mimicry (where roleplaying activity falls, for Callois himself), for the specific type of game called Ludos ("structured gaming activities based on rules").<br/>So we can only say that Edwards' ideas are a possible subset of a specific and limited section of Callois system of gaming definitions, and nothing more.<br/>There is only a casual similarity in terminology, that often confuse people and let them think they can extend one model with the other.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>agon (skill)</blockquote>\nThis translation is wrong.<br/>Agon means "challenge", not skill. Chess, is a Agon game; but also sports. As someone else already pointed out, Agon for Callois requires an opponent, physically recognizable. It also requires a set of rules that can grant the balance of the challenge and the definition of "handicaps" to fill possible gaps that may compromise the balance of the challenging game.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>And those opposites can be entangled such that "both agon and alea" can be understood to mean mimicry, as successful mimicry is at once a skillful (albeit not wholly competitive) performance as well as a willingness to subject oneself to the dictates of fortune. By the same token, ilinx is clearly "neither agon nor alea" in that the dislocations or dissociations one experiences in ilingic play obviate both skill and luck.</blockquote>\nWhile this is completely out of your own ideas.<br/>Callois' definitions are quite clear and identify Alea as those gaming activities centered on "randomness" (slot machines).<br/>Mimicry is the activity of pretend. The roleplaying as we intend it. It has no opposition to any of the others, is just "another way of play games", a way based on the intention of wearing a mask and pretend to be someone else that mask defines.<br/>Ilinx, again, is the intention of producing "fun" from a physiological alteration of perceptions.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>So what happens if we imagine agon, alea, mimicry, and ilinx as the corners of a semiotic square?</blockquote>\nThis is quite in contrast with your initial statement\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>our theories should be constructed in light of the empirical evidence available.</blockquote>\nAre you imagining, or are you discussing empirical evidences?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>Conversely, the combination of mimicry and ilinx is Drama</blockquote>\nNo. Drama is Mimicry alone.<br/>Danced Drama (Opera) is a combination of Mimicry and Ilinx. This is by Callois own definitions.<br/><br/>Anyway, the main difference between the two system is that Collois wants to focus on degenerations caused by these four gaming types.<br/>The descriptions of these degenerations state quite clear that there's nothing in common with Edwards' classification of CAs, which represent the reason for a player is going to choose to play again.<br/><br/>Agon related perversion is the loss of sane challenge, replaced by the urge of winning, an obsession that can rise to the lack of respect of the game rules (cheating).<br/>Alea perversion is the game addiction that many people suffer from with poker or gambling in general. This is clinically defined as "addiction without drugs". It's a illness.<br/>Mimicry perversion is the idea that the Mask is the Reality and it can be identified by the exchange of the two in one's priority scale (which makes clear enough we are talking of RPGs). The perversion of Mimicry to the lowest degree is what is called "escapism", while to the higher degree is called... "loss of touch with reality".<br/>Ilinx perversion is a complex phenomenon that crosses psyche and physical and can be described with what we know as "drunk", which is both a physical derangement and a psychological need. This is clinical as well.<br/><br/>I am not personally against an alternative to Edwards' CAs... but don't build them on Callois.<br/>Edwards' efforts have always been directed to the analysis of actual plays, of the true played games as the activity of a group that is willingly having fun together (the social contract). There's a lot more of parallelism with Gadamer's view about games, than Callois'.<br/><br/>Further, my personal note on the Narrativism/Simulationist "war".<br/>Most of the game sessions I saw that was claimed to be Narrativist, were instead Simulationist Character Priority, or Simulationist High Concept (you find these definitions in E. C. Boss essay in Playgrounds Worlds, 2005).<br/>Narrativism come to play when a player develops and resolve a <i>personal</i> Premise. And the Character is one of the tool he may use to develop and resolve it.<br/>If you play and resolve a premise that is derived from the game book, you're playing Simulationist, because you're celebrating a specific aspect of the game itself, whether it is color, character, situation, setting or system.<br/>There are actually <i>five</i> possible declinations of the SIM instance.<br/>So it is by far the easiest CA achievable in a roleplaying activity.<br/>Narrativism starts when the players decide they will introduce their own personal interests in the game, when the characters themselves are built around backgrounds and even traits that are yelling out their need of be "resolved".<br/>There is the idea that Simulationism (or Right to Dream, or Be There) is a kind of void playing. I don't think so. It is a kind of playing that is based on "topoi" (plural for "topos"), on icons, on universally recognizable instances of aesthetic concepts.<br/>For example: I play the "captain of the ship" and my play is entirely inspired on Captain Kirk, as depicted in Star Trek series.<br/>I can go deep in the exploration of Kirk's sense of responsibility on his crew, on his sense of loyalty to the ideas of the Federation and his light-solar behaviour toward alien species. This is still Simulationism, because the choices I make in the game I play are a celebration of a specific character drawn from a recognizable fiction that is external to the very game I am taking part to (I bring him in, but it's brought from outside).<br/>It becomes Narrativism when I decide I throw Kirk to the wolves and I start asking myself "what the hell is my wife doing at home, while I am here at the frontier of the galaxy?" and I start making game choices aimed to go back at home to my warm and soft sofa, so possibly creating conflicts with anyone who still wants to explore the unknown or even rising conflicts with -myself- and those sense of responsibility and loyalty this character was build onto.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275055/#Comment_275055" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-08T20:06:59+00:00" title="June  8, 2010  8:06PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 9, 2010 9:29AM by Bill_White.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Davide. That's the kind of gimlet-eyed critique a fellow can appreciate. I'll cop to using Caillois creatively (more precisely: metaphorically) rather than strictly, but I'm not sure that I actually fall afoul of the formal/functional distinction you want to make; in fact, by my lights I've hewed pretty closely to it. In other words, I see Caillois's typology as a set of semantic distinctions describing what it's like to play, exactly as you suggest, and then play a game with their meanings in order to build up another set of distinctions describing the kinds of social contexts in which play takes place. And while you are exactly right to point out that it is at that point that I am departing from Caillois, if that's not functional, I'm not sure what is. I get that your real objection is the looseness with which I use Caillois's types as a springboard for thinking about "Creative Agenda," and that ultimately your position is that there's room yet for using the Big Model's CAs to make sense of actual play (albeit perhaps with greater attention to its specific ramifications). That's cool with me; the only thing I'd stipulate is that these models are normative and prescriptive rather than value-neutral and descriptive--they shape play as much as they describe it. Also, I'd be careful about describing CA in individualistic rather than collective terms; what makes some play "Sim" and other play "Narr" is not necessarily how I play but how it fits in with the larger cycle of play: in Sim play, I get rewarded when I hit Kirk-like tropes; in Narr play, I get rewarded when I confront them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Davide%20Losito" title="Davide Losito"><img alt="Davide Losito" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.webinprogress.it/allyraid/badtoro2out.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Davide%20Losito">Davide Losito</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275056/#Comment_275056" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-08T20:36:59+00:00" title="June  8, 2010  8:36PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>I get that your real objection is the looseness with which I use Caillois's types as a springboard for thinking about "Creative Agenda,"</blockquote>\nExactly this.<br/>You risk a "backdoor" by inserting a basis that is theoretically incorrect. I think that your way of describing the semantic square is intriguing, but if I were you, I'd go with a completely different vocaboulary, otherwise it looks like you're asking Callois' help to fill in into what you feel lacking of Ron's schema.<br/>And I personally think Callois cannot help you, but it may result confusing if someone who already knows Callois reads your essay.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>in Sim play, I get rewarded when I hit Kirk-like tropes; in Narr play, I get rewarded when I confront them.</blockquote>\nThis is another topic... what do you mean with "rewarded"? It's clear CA is reached at the end of the Reward Cycle, it's another issue that it's pretty clean on Emily's essay (although it look like there's an unresloved oxymoron between CA that is group related and Reward Cycles that is player related; but oxymorons never scared me :P).<br/>Anyway I am not sure NAR is about confronting Kirk-specific tropes. I find this SIM still. As long as it's "Kirk-specific" in that example, it's SIM.<br/>It's NAR when it becomes "Davide-specific" or "Bill-specific".<br/>But I may misunderstand what you mean for "confront" in here...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>I'd stipulate is that these models are normative and prescriptive rather than value-neutral and descriptive--they shape play as much as they describe it</blockquote>\nThis is quite interesting too. I think that they result prescriptive if you think about them while you play. If you leave the play time-frame free of any theorical speculation, you'll find that there is no prescription whatsoever.

It only gives names to what we always did.<br/>The Forge Theory teaches you of specific focused techniques to achieve specific results in game-design.<br/>The latter is derived from the former, but the former can exist without the latter.<br/>I can describe any RPGs with the BM and I am not changing them, because the BM describes an activity.<br/><br/>Aren't we a bit OT?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lee_Short" title="Lee_Short"><img alt="Lee_Short" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lee_Short">Lee_Short</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275074/#Comment_275074" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-08T22:12:18+00:00" title="June  8, 2010 10:12PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 8, 2010 10:13PM by Lee_Short.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Intended as a whisper.  <br/><br/>Why is there no way to do that as a retcon?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SheikhJahbooty" title="SheikhJahbooty"><img alt="SheikhJahbooty" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SheikhJahbooty">SheikhJahbooty</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275076/#Comment_275076" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-08T22:21:31+00:00" title="June  8, 2010 10:21PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            lol,<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I understand it correctly, it's a funny point.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is one category. It contains "the behavior of particles in the universe for it's entire history".<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there is another category. It contains "what I decided to do for fun this evening".<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously those are two very different things. When I describe the universe, it never says, "Huh, I never realized the implications of gravity being inversely proportional to the square of the distances between two objects. I'll do gravity different from now on." When you describe a certain type of play as narrativist, it is possible for me to say, "Huh, I never realized the implications of awarding experience points in that way for those activities, and allowing them to be spent in those avenues. I'll play differently from now on."<br/>\n<br/>\nI probably don't understand GNS adequately, but I thought it was supposed to be prescriptive. I don't understand how that's a critique so much as just pointing out something obvious. Gamism is a creative agenda that can be satisfied with card games. Simulationism is a creative agenda that can be satisfied with computer games. The closest that any other game can come to satisfying a narrativist creative agenda is quests in an MMORPG, and those are invariably more like amusement part attractions than actual stories that address a premise, and they never address a premise at the expense of a character. So when a role playing game attempts to provide rules that would encourage you to play that way, that role playing game is focusing on that which is unique to this hobby, to that type of game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with Davide, Zac and Mark, that Bill's categories seem like technical or formal agendas rather than creative agendas, describing how people have fun, rather than why they have fun, but I'm so interested in seeing where this is going that I don't want to push the point, and risk discouraging anybody.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also don't understand how "defensible" is at all important in this sort of thing. Is it applicable? Is it illustrative? Does it lead to any new understanding? Those seem like fair questions to ask of the Bill Model.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275111/#Comment_275111" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-09T06:27:12+00:00" title="June  9, 2010  6:27AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Davide Losito</cite>Do you find mechanical physics prescriptive?
