Originally, it was written with the portrayal of epic stories in mind, where the hero goes on long quests, changes the world, and then usually dies at the end. My three big inspirations were the Trials of Hercules, Howard's <i>Conan</i> stories, and the various Philip Marlowe novels by Chandler.<br/><br/>Game-wise, inspiration comes primarily from <i>DitV</i>, <i>Hero's Banner</i> and <i>Polaris</i>.<br/><br/>Here's how it works, in basic:<br/><br/>1) The play group collectively creates a <b>Hero</b> (Heroes can be male or female, but since I'm male, I will tend to use male pronouns). A Hero is defined primarily by a <b>Passion</b> which is both a strength and weakness. He occupies a <b>Setting</b>. He has three numerical traits called "Hero", "Shadow", and "Overcome" which all start at zero. There's a collaborative process by which the group decides what their setting looks like, and how the Passion will drive play. Basically, people try to reach consensus on what their game is going to look like.<br/><br/>2) The play group brainstorm some cool <b>Aspects</b> for the Hero. Like in other games, Aspects in <i>DotF</i> are things that are cool and catchy about the character (catchphrases, moods, bits of backstory, etc.) and also scenes or locations. Aspects are handed around and everybody gets one that they babysit.<br/><br/>3) The group decides on a Hero player. The player to the left of the Hero player becomes the <b>Shadow</b> player. All the other players become <b>Fates</b>.<br/><br/>4) The job of the Hero player is to make the Hero do cool, heroic things, in keeping with his Passion. The job of the Shadow is to make the Hero suffer as much as possible, in keeping with the Passion. The job of the Fates is to keep the scenes colourful and to make sure the Aspects get as much spotlight as reasonably possible (especially the Aspects they are babysitting). Roleplaying proceeds more-or-less freeform until conflict arises.<br/><br/>5) Conflict follows an increasingly familiar "stake setting" process. In DotF, the winner of the last scene (or the Shadow if this is the first scene) sets stakes first, and the player who sets stakes second is allowed to tailor their own stakes in response. Only the Hero and Shadow players set stakes; the Hero's stakes should be heroic, the Shadow's shadowy. Once stakes are set, the Fates all vote in secret by putting a colour-coded die (eg, white for Hero, black for Shadow) into a bag. The Hero player picks the Fate player who did the best job portraying elements of their Aspect in the scene, and names that Fate the "Ruling Fate". The Ruling Fate gets to cast a second vote that must be the same as the first. The Hero throws in a vote for him/herself, and the Shadow does the same (the Hero or Shadow can vote for the other player, but I can't imagine why they ever would).<br/><br/>6) The dice are all rolled together, and compared, with the highest single dice winning, and ties resolved by the second die. The number of dice of one colour needed to win is the degree of success. So, if it's Hero 6, 4, 1 and Shadow 6, 2, then the Hero needed 2 dice to win and gets degree 2. If it's Hero 4, 1 and Shadow 6, 5, then the Shadow only needed one die to win and it's degree 1.<br/><br/>7) The Ruling Fate gets narrative rights over the outcome of the scene, depending on who wins the stakes. Once the scene is finished, the ruling fate rolls dice equal to the degree of success and totals them up, then adds that value to either the "Hero" or "Shadow" score on the character sheet.<br/><br/>8) The Hero may choose to <b>Overcome</b> the Fates, substituting his own narration. He then rolls dice equal to the degree of success and write them on the record sheet next to "Overcome" on the character sheet.<br/><br/>9) When one of "Hero", "Shadow", or "Overcome" reaches a certain value (determined at the start of the game), then there are resolution mechanics to tie up the end of the Hero's story, showing either how their Passion drove them to Heroic heights or Shadowy lows, or else how they Overcame Fate and lived a more normal life, and the impact that the various endings have on the Setting.<br/><br/>10) At the option of the group, a new Hero (controlled by a new Hero player) is made up to fit the setting (as changed by the previous game) and play continues!<br/><br/>The mechanics all have more specifics to them, obviously, but that's the framework.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207187/#Comment_207187" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-13T17:28:12+00:00" title="May 13, 2009  5:28PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neat.

What do the players do? What do the characters do?<br/><br/>And how do you envisage this playing out at the table? How would the dialogue go?

Most specifically, endings that leave a lasting impact on the game world.<br/><br/>The Hero player narrates what the Hero does, where the Hero goes, what the Hero wants. The Shadow player narrates all of the forces acting against the Hero, including enemies, environments, and the dark side of the Heroes' own Passion. The Fates (all other players) add detail and colour to the world by describing and building up the Hero's aspects. The Fates are competing amongst themselves to add the coolest and most catchy details, because whichever Fate adds the best details gets an extra vote, and generally will get end-of-scene narration.<br/><br/>The Hero character basically wanders around the world, getting in trouble depending on what the players narrate, moving inexorably toward one of the three possible endings (Hero, Shadow, and Overcome), which are defined early in play (officially right after a prologue scene). Other characters exist primarily to interact with the Hero and force him to face his Passion. They can be controlled by either the Shadow player or the Fates.<br/><br/>At the table, ideally, games would be fairly short. Personally, I like the idea of one session being about one Hero, and reaching the end of that Hero's tale by the end of the session. Then the next session starts with a new Hero, with a different Hero player. This keeps the spotlight moving. If players don't mind one person hogging all the Hero-time, then longer-term play is possible.<br/><br/>All of the roles have their advantages. Playing the Hero means you are more-or-less the star of a lot of the action, and you get to be the one who is making a lot of the major decisions. Playing the Shadow has its appeal in that you get to be as evil and manipulative as you want to be, since you are literally in an adversarial role. Playing the Fates will tend to give you the most end-of-scene narration, which means that moreso than any other player, the Fates are determining the overall outcome of scenes -- and thereby the game.<br/><br/>Hard to say who would get it in my group, sadly. I play with a great bunch of very creative gamers who love shifting narration, but they tend to have a hard time taking risks with new games. When I wrote the game, I had new gamers in mind, however, particularly lit-nerds.<br/><br/>One of the things I want people to come away with is a sense that often in literature (well, pulp and some older works) Heroes have little control over their own destiny, and tend to bounce from one problem to the next.<br/><br/>Oh, I should add, if anyone wants to have a look at the full game, I can send it to them in a word processor format of their choice, and possibly PDF if I can figure out how to do the conversion. I am not much of a techie, but I know the basics.<br/><br/>-Adam Drew                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207206/#Comment_207206" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-13T19:02:35+00:00" title="May 13, 2009  7:02PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I kinda like the concept but here are my first thoughts and questions<br/><br/>First, Have you considered not having the shadow be antithetical to the hero. I know conan's all your inspiration, but I always rather thought conan was partly cool because of its revolving cast of badies. The shadow being the big bad kinda messes that up. Would you consider making the hero and the shadow share the character into a kind of , larp techniquey thing they have been talking about here. Either the hero or the shadow is prominate and has control with the other side offering insight/advice/wisecracks as required (also nicely joins up with Conan being a fighter and a thief) . <br/><br/>This also means that big bad duty would be passed over to the fates which makes about 9000 more sense to me. It also makes an interesting dynamic because it splits the party. with 5 people that's one character (hero/shadow) vs 3 fates which I think you may find interesting. <br/><br/>Also, what do you think about getting rid of collaberative character design. I fucking hate it so much , because althought it guarenties that a slow sloth will never ruin the day, it also guaranties that any individuals brilliance will inevitably be diluted by so much chaff. If you have 5 people and only 1 character, you could literally have one person make their own individual pitch for being hero , looking for a shadow without all this democracy (or the  mad rule of the masses as we called it in greece).<br/><br/>just some thoughts, Hope they are helpful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_207221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207221/#Comment_207221" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-13T20:15:51+00:00" title="May 13, 2009  8:15PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, the Shadow plays -all- the bads. The Shadow doesn't have one character like the Hero does. The Shadow is similar to the Mistake in <i>Polaris</i>, in that he plays all people, places, and forces antithetical to the Hero.<br/><br/>Character design isn't strictly collaborative. The collaborative part is more the world-building. Maybe that's not clear from the brief version here, but the Aspects are more like Aspects of the setting than of the Hero. Here's some excerpt from the actual game document:<br/><br/>"The Aspect, like the Passion, can be as short or long as it needs to be, so long as each person knows that their Aspect has to fit the Hero's Passion and the Setting. Aspects can be anything. Origins, powers, descriptions, enemies, conflicts, elements, actions, one-liners, weapons, prophecies, whatever."<br/><br/>"The Hero, it turns out, is being chased across the <i>Bitter Desert</i> by a <i>Death Cult</i>, because of a <i>Prophecy of Doom</i>, and is heading to the <i>City of Thieves</i> (Aspects in italics...)"<br/><br/>Aspects are fleshed out by play, as well. At the end of a scene where an Aspect has been developed, the group can add details to it.<br/><br/>I don't know if I'd want to do away with the voting. Part of the "shtick" of the game is that ultimately the Fates are guiding the Hero's destiny, <i>unless</i> the Hero chooses to Overcome the Fates.<br/><br/>I suppose it could be re-designed so that the Shadow is in the hands of all of the Fates, making it something like a reverse-<i>Agon</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207258">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207258/#Comment_207258" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-14T05:46:34+00:00" title="May 14, 2009  5:46AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing I like about this is the tacit endorsement of unbalanced player roles.

I know you say otherwise, but c'mon.  <br/><br/>"The hero sort of wanders around" raises a red flag for me - I'd like to see something more concrete, a goal or objective, even a metaphorical one, something players can latch onto to avoid aimless play.  <br/><br/>Why stakes?  That seems like a lazy choice.  If it is a game about fate, how can their be multiple outcomes?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_207308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207308/#Comment_207308" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-14T09:45:37+00:00" title="May 14, 2009  9:45AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason:<br/><br/>OK, that's a good point. I think aimless play is -somewhat- prevented by the fact that after the prologue session, the Hero writes his endings (a la <i>Hero's Banner</i>), so there is a concrete(ish) goal to be worked toward. This is what I wrote in the <i>DotF</i> rule document:<br/><br/>" First, ask yourself (and everyone else) what would happen if the Hero's Passion drove him to greatness. This is the "good" ending. This is where your story ends up if everything goes your way, and you resolve your various inner turmoils, vanquish your greatest foes, and reach the safe harbour at the end of your voyage. This is the ending that makes everyone cheer! Write down, in sentences or point form, how your Hero's story ends if he wins. Note that this is an "ending" but it doesn't have to be "The End". This is just the end of your journey. Batman comics keep coming out, but that's because Batman's journey ends, in a sense, with him becoming the Dark Knight. He has reached a catharsis wherein he will never abandon that quest, and he will sacrifice everything in its pursuit. That's why people like to tell Batman's origin story so much: it's where the real crux of the character lies. The bottom line is to determine how the Setting is changed if the Hero fulfills his Heroic Destiny. Once you've got it figured out, write the answer down under HERO.<br/><br/>The second question is what would happen if the Hero's Passion drove him down the dark path. This is the "bad" ending. That doesn't mean everyone should feel let down by this ending; quite the opposite! The "bad" ending should just leave everyone hissing through their teeth with how far your Hero has fallen. The Hero is overwhelmed by his Passion, and he is ruled by it. What if, instead of becoming the Dark Knight, Gotham's eternal defender, Batman is so driven to fight crime that he abandons his righteousness, and turns his skill and wealth to crushing crime no matter the cost, with no regard for innocent life, property damage, or his own life? He ceases to be the Dark Knight, and is instead the Dark Warlord. Still potentially cool, but pretty different. Don't forget to get feedback from the other players here! You never know when someone else might have a great idea that utterly blows you away. The bottom line is to determine how the Setting is changed if the Hero embraces his Shadow Destiny. Once you've got it figured out, write the answer down under SHADOW.<br/><br/>Third question: What happens if the Hero rejects Fate? This is the "bummer" ending. This is the ending where Batman unmasks. This is the ending where the world falls back into chaos. A story where the Hero falls to Shadow is dark; a story where the Hero rejects Fate entirely is a tragedy. So, what are we talking about here? Are we talking about no hope? The ending where everyone says "oh. Well, that sucked." No! We're talking about tragedy! The Hero just can't bear the burden of Fate any longer and throws it all away for the hope at a normal life... he's Overcome, he gives up, and (probably) something bad happens. The bottom line is what happens to the world if the Hero doesn't change it at all, but events are just allowed to progress... to whatever end. In a way, this is the hardest of the three Destinies to write, since you have to imagine everything else in the setting all at once. Don't forget to mention what happens to the Overcome Hero. What does a Hero do when he gives up? Does he become a farmer? Does he hang up his guns only to be murdered by some kid trying to make his reputation? An interesting twist is if by being Overcome, the Hero's world is actually better off. Do Heroes cause the very chaos they combat? Once you've got it figured out, write the answer down under OVERCOME.<br/><br/>The key with these Destinies is that they are ultimately the endpoints of the Hero's adventures. The Hero player should, in theory, always be striving towards the HERO Destiny. Any time he wins a scene, the Hero player should be resolving it in such a way that his Passion drives him toward the HERO ending. Conversely, every time the Shadow player wins a scene, it's her job to push the Hero toward the SHADOW Destiny."<br/><br/>The reason there are stakes is that there's more than one "Destiny", and different forces are driving the Hero toward different ends. I'm thinking Fate in a classical sense, where the Fates themselves are active participants moreso than just passive forces that set a path that must be followed. Thus "Dance" of the Fates.<br/><br/>There is a definite embrace of unequal player roles, with the hope that anyone who is bugged by that will be satisfied that they get to be Hero next time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207314/#Comment_207314" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-14T09:59:32+00:00" title="May 14, 2009  9:59AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: deadlytoque</cite>The reason there are stakes is that there's more than one "Destiny", and different forces are driving the Hero toward different ends.

Stake-setting is a mechanic rather than thematic choice, and one that doesn't really reinforce what you are after here in my opinion.  <br/><br/>For example, Fates (players) could be variously aligned with or against the hero, and resolution might determine which of them tells the group a conflict's outcome.

I think it still captures what I was going for (Hero's life ultimately not in his hands) while not tying the Ruling Fate to any particular stake.<br/><br/>Actually, even scrapping the idea of "Stakes" in exchange for "Intent" might be enough.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207374/#Comment_207374" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-14T12:54:45+00:00" title="May 14, 2009 12:54PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is the game about intent?<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_207382">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207382/#Comment_207382" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-14T13:18:42+00:00" title="May 14, 2009  1:18PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, it's about struggling against Fate, but you can't be bitchslapped by Fate if you aren't striving for something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207408/#Comment_207408" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-14T14:29:37+00:00" title="May 14, 2009  2:29PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The game Annalise has this nifty conflict mechanism that might inspire you. When you get to that point in play where you're ready to engage the rules to resolve a conflict, you determine two independent (orthogonal) stakes. Things that could both come true, or both fail, etc. Then the tentative outcomes of those get determined via dice. <br/><br/>So from the start, you know what's at stake and you have an inkling how it will turn out if no one interferes. Thing is, everyone at the table gets to spend currency to interfere. Also, there are outcomes that allows a meddler to create a new stake for the conflict and randomly set its tentative outcome.<br/><br/>This seems like a cool way the Hero, Shadow, and Fates to wrestle in challenges. You can twiddle the difficulty or cost of meddling for the Hero, for example. <br/><br/>I can describe the Annalise mechanics in greater detail, if you're interested.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_207410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207410/#Comment_207410" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-14T14:34:08+00:00" title="May 14, 2009  2:34PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adam,<br/><br/>Yeah, I'd like to hear more.
