While I may have read the situation wrong, I don't think Bill is actually trying to "beat" the players in any way, but he makes it seem like he is. So we groan when he hammers us, and whoop and cheer when we manage to outfox him in conflicts. <br/><br/>So I decided to make a point of doing this in my Pareidolix sessions at DexCon, and it seems to really add some zest to things. There was one example in particular, where I'd specified that if I won a conflict, a player not only failed to bring the defense system online, but an NPC in the scene would die as a result. A PC had just died holding off the zombies, and it would really take something away from his sacrifice if the zombies still took someone out, so this was an important roll. I didn't pull any punches, and went for the win, and got it. But the player won narration, and described how the defense grid went haywire before shutting down entirely, killing the NPC marine in the room. I think I said something like, "You sneaky bastard. I never said the zombies killed him, did I?" They went nuts, laughing and cheering at out-thinking me like that. They absolutely loved it. Hell, I loved it, too. <br/><br/>The thing of it is, that I'm not really trying to win in any sense. I'm just trying to make things more interesting in the short term, so that their long term victory will be all the more sweet. I think that's what Bill does in his games, too.<br/><br/>Anyone else out there use this? Any thoughts on the matter?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/aeonite" title="aeonite"><img alt="aeonite" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.aeforge.com/~aeon/images/sg/myicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/aeonite">aeonite</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218152/#Comment_218152" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-13T19:25:23+00:00" title="July 13, 2009  7:25PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I too like this technique. One of the things that has turned me off about 4e has been that the DMs I've played with have seemed to be the group's best friend. They balance encounters so as to provide just enough challenge without actually killing anyone. They ask for wishlists of magic items and then dole out exactly what the group needs as they progress through the dungeon. Etc.<br/><br/>The best example of the OPPOSITE approach (and the best RP experience I've ever had) was a GM who ran an Unknown Armies campaign for me and my group (the one that, coincidentally, went on to inspire me to create <a href="http://www.aeforge.com/vox/" rel="nofollow">Vox</a>. At every turn, the GM was throwing things at us, refusing to pull punches or make it easy. If we messed up, it meant that goons in the casino would chop off our fingers, or that we would catch a horrible STD through some magical transference, or that we would get an arm chopped off in a fan on a failed sneak roll. At one point, he maneuvered the game in such a way as to make my character (a Personamancer) kill off one of the NPCs, entirely willingly. Only through two amazing rolls did that NPC survive, and even then the GM removed him from the game and said he was hospitalized for several months.<br/><br/>I think that when the GM is an adversary, it makes the players necessarily band together and become more of a group, helping each other out. I've been in bad groups where there's the one guy who wants to play an evil thief and disrupt everything, and this usually occurs in groups where the GM is not actively trying (or at least pretending) to kill the group. In Vox, the Voices in everyone's heads are intended to be cooperative and helpful (even if in non-obvious ways), and the way I've framed that is to basically have everyone and everything else trying to do you in. The players HAVE to work together because it's the only way they'll figure out what's going on.<br/><br/>Of course this isn't always appropriate. In Ninja Burger, for example, the Gamemaster is one of the characters, and he's tasked with cooperating with them. There, it's a lighthearted humor game so it works, and there's a built-in environmental factor (30 minutes or less, or you commit seppuku) to drive the challenge. In HELLAS, the GM is always sort of interpreting intent, and he more often than not works WITH the players rather than against them. But HELLAS has a built in assumption that every character is going to die at some point, and the players are given a lot of ability to choose when that happens so they can pass on their legacy to the next generation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218239/#Comment_218239" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-14T08:11:48+00:00" title="July 14, 2009  8:11AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think a good 4e DM is a schizophrenic.

Anyway, I have quite the reputation for being a brutally old-school, killer DM. Of course, there is just enough truth in it to keep people honest. People come together when under fire. Just as a good manager wants the best for everyone, but sets himself up as the bad guy, so should a good gamemaster.<br/><br/>The simple fact is that the GM typically keeps the game going. There is no challenge if he or she knuckles under and is friend to the players. An insecure GM, on the other hand, can completely steamroll the party without breaking a sweat. Only by setting up a fair situation and then pretending the odds are hopeless can the GM make the party really strive to earn their accomplishments. Drill sergeants do the same thing.<br/><br/>Plus, you know, sometimes it is fun to mess with people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218270/#Comment_218270" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-14T10:55:39+00:00" title="July 14, 2009 10:55AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 14, 2009 10:56AM by David_Berg.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Drew, I'm with ya.

Although in Ganakagok, the GM does have to fight really hard to avoid being steamrolled by the increasingly powerful gifts of the PCs, so it isn't all pretense. <br/><br/>The thing I like about SOTC in fact is how it encourages players to mess with themselves -- as when during "Rex Rich" Tony L-B playing girl reporter Lucy Lovelace got herself captured when she snuck aboard Air-Baron Zevo's zeppelin. This makes the GM's job easier.<br/><br/>The thing to remember is that some games reward players for introducing complications for themselves and others don't -- but some players may be so used to one that they play the same way in the other sort of game, which can lead to social level problems: "Hey, play right!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218290/#Comment_218290" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-14T12:48:50+00:00" title="July 14, 2009 12:48PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>I think a good 4e DM is a schizophrenic.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>In sports we call this 'a good player.'

And I do. But I also want their characters to kick ass and do well. And I let them know that outside of game. Much like after a football game I'll congratulate the other team, remember their awesome plays and celebrate the time that they totally forced a fumble -- but during the game I will do everything fair and proper to crush them into the mud and make them stay there. The major difference is that in sports its less both at the same time. In sports, during the game you play hard but fair, but you really want to win all the time. In an RPG during the game I want both to win and for the players to win at the same time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218364">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Morris" title="Andrew Morris"><img alt="Andrew Morris" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.plaguemonkey.com/sgicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Morris">Andrew Morris</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218364/#Comment_218364" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-14T22:34:47+00:00" title="July 14, 2009 10:34PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, glad to hear I'm not alone in crazy-land. The thing I've come to realize about my game in particular is that it supports this adversity thing pretty well. The game where I really was the most aggressive was the necro-steampunk fantasy game on Sunday, and the dramatic power arc played out very clearly. Because the GM is mechanically balanced with the players, I can can go full out on them without pulling any punches, and I should, because doing so means I won't have the juice at the end, where it really matters. In the past, I've pulled my punches somewhat, and that left me with too much power at the endgame. <br/><br/>Right on, Dave. This is probably why I don't really enjoy PTA. <br/><br/>And Bill, I'm not so sure about the power breakdown in Ganakagok. Have you ever been a player while someone else ran it? I can say from experience that we've always had to fight hard to get a happy ending for EITHER the world or the people, and almost always sacrificing our own characters' happy ending to get it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218406/#Comment_218406" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-15T06:43:36+00:00" title="July 15, 2009  6:43AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know waht they say,<br/><br/>Fake it til you make it <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218410/#Comment_218410" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-15T07:21:42+00:00" title="July 15, 2009  7:21AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 15, 2009 7:22AM by Graham.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valvorik</cite>I think a good 4e DM is a schizophrenic.

I once played a RPG based loosely on the comic HellBoy where there was a pool of PCs the players could choose from for each game.  The GM essentially had a pool of adversaries that he drew from.  This worked quite well.  The players had some limited information of what the goal of each mission would be and would plan who they needed to bring/play for each game.  In some games the players chose just right and had the best characters with the most applicable skills.  Other times it didn't go so well.  Since none of the characters were "their character" they didn't have a vested interest in making sure they survived.  Of course if a particular hero laid down his life for the greater good he was unavailable in future games.  So if you lost the only guy who spoke Spanish you hoped that the next game wasn't in a Spanish speaking country.  The GM had to make similar decisions, like when to cut his losses and have his villains make a break for it or they would not be available for future games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachlan" title="lachlan"><img alt="lachlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachlan">lachlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230761/#Comment_230761" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-09T06:42:55+00:00" title="September  9, 2009  6:42AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 9, 2009 7:11AM by lachlan.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To be an adversarial GM: To be challenging?
