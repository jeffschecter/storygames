This seemed like a great idea, backing the project would cover your registration and the con wouldn't run if there weren't enough prepaid attendees.  Great, then I realized that any area that could support a con probably already had one.  So, the question became, how do you get people to back a con, even if they can't attend?  <br/><br/>One thing that scientific conferences do is to offer conference proceedings and books of abstracts.  That got me thinking - if game materials were produced at a con or published at a con then you would have something to offer your backers, even if they couldn't make the con.<br/><br/>In terms of producing things at a con, many recent games have playbooks, playsets, frames, or other small mandated fan-made elements.  A workshop at the con could probably put together some pretty cool stuff that could be put together for attendees and backers.   <br/><br/>So, I guess the question remains, <b>how do you get people to back a con, even if they can't attend?  </b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311195/#Comment_311195" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-04T19:10:22+00:00" title="February  4, 2011  7:10PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 4, 2011 7:14PM by misuba.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have the con focus on a topic that cuts across all locales and is underserved.

But if we'd been a little better organized the first year and had a better budget, we might have been able to break even then, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
