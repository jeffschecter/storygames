I've read Robin's Laws and am looking at categorizing my players (loosely) but also want to touch on a technique Amber suggests: gearing the encounters to the design choices players make during the character creation process. <br/><br/>Chargen in Amber differs from other games though, and I'm looking for a more generic way to do it. I would like to categorize encounters so that I can then go down the character sheets and tick off how much focus each player put in that are, compare that to the total amount of points/feat slots/whatevers spent, and use that data to generate rough percentages for encounters. I've got the following so far:<br/><br/><b>Physical Combat:</b> this involves melee and ranged combat. Depending on the game it might be worthwhile to split the two.<br/><br/><b>Social combat:</b> this might not be straight up social combat as it is in Exalted, but it would be that portion of the game where the die rolls focus on getting something done via words. In some systems this one will not be determinable via the character sheets because there's not ingrained rule set for talks between PCs and NPCs.<br/><br/><b>War:</b> This involves mass combat. Again, it might not be a viable category for many games or campaign styles.<br/><br/><b>Investigation:</b> encounters involving investigation range anywhere from searching a tomb for traps to digging through the ambassador's underwear drawer looking for a murder weapon. Anything that involves a character actively searching for information falls here. In some games there may be overlap between the traits and skills that make up verbal investigation and social interaction.<br/><br/><b>Knowledge:</b> These types of encounters revolve around knowing stuff. If the game doesn't have a knowledge system, this one probably isn't useful.<br/><br/><b>Physical non-Combat:</b> These encounters involve physical skills that aren't combat oriented, like climbing, swimming, or surviving a radioactive blizzard on Alpha Ceti 9.<br/><br/><b>Intrigue: </b> Political maneuverings, in depth mysteries, and social entanglements. This may overlap some with social combat and investigation.<br/><br/><b>Purely Magical</b>: Depending on the game, this may have a lot of overlap with other types.<br/><br/><b>Mechanical / Artistic</b>: This is a catch-all category for those skills and abilities focused on creation, building, and fixing. Everything from craft to perform may fall here, depending on its use.<br/><br/>Another type of encounter that doesn't mesh as well with the idea of percentaged encounter distributions , but is still a necessity for anyone wanting to set up times for their players to strut their own unique brands of awesome:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rob Alexander</cite><strong>Special Enemies:</strong>encounters where the enemy (or whatever opposition) are one that a PC has a special power against or special immunity to. E.g. undead for clerics, named enemy for rangers. This extends to non-animate opposition as well, e.g. jumping over flaming pits is less dangerous for a character with partial fire immunity.</blockquote>\nThese aren't meant to be standalone categories. For instance, a single encounter may start with social combat, transition to real combat if the negotiations fail, and finally into knowledge when they want to know why the seemingly human ambassador disappeared in a haze of green mist when Hojo the Strong snapped his neck.<br/><br/>What other categories should I look at? Anything that can be determined from a character sheet is valid. If it can't be seen in the player's numbers it doesn't help here. That's not to say that it isn't useful, just that it isn't useful to this method. For instance, some players like solving riddles and puzzles, but there are very few games with a "solve riddle" skill.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86088">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86088/#Comment_86088" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-07T08:57:46+00:00" title="August  7, 2007  8:57AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James McMurray</cite>gearing the encounters to the design choices players make during the character creation process.</blockquote>\nHey James, are you familiar with flags?  That's what people have been calling what you are talking about, around here, and it doesn't surprise me that it's been offered as advice for a long time (like in Amber as you suggest).  I like games that makes this explicit - Prime Time Adventures, for example, gives you half a dozen slots to fill out (Issue, Edges, Connections, maybe a Nemesis) and they all point to exactly the sort of things a player wants out of the game.  Anyway, conversations about flags might be interesting to you, FYI.<br/><br/>I'd think you could create a rough scene percentage by giving weight to the various areas of the sheet, allowing for the complexity of different sorts of information, and then vary that based on player choice.  As far as categories, how about non-violent physical challenges, like climbing cliffs?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_86096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86096/#Comment_86096" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-07T09:18:56+00:00" title="August  7, 2007  9:18AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<em>7th Sea</em> also has some broad categories of content, although I can't recall what they are at the moment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86099">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray" title="James McMurray"><img alt="James McMurray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray">James McMurray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86099/#Comment_86099" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-07T09:33:48+00:00" title="August  7, 2007  9:33AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, I've heard the term flgs, but never known exctly what they were.

I'll explain the difference, if I can, so that you can decide if the methodology in general is something you might want to adopt. And it's also just a discussion I've been wanting to bring up of late. So...<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll term the method that the vast majority of gamers use out there as the "standard plot paradigm" of play, or (SPP). This is juxtaposed against the "character-centric paradim" of play, or (CCP). Just for ease of reference. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo in SPP, even when looking at these "categories" and such, the process of plot development for play goes something like this:<br/>\n1. GM develops an idea of an overarching plotline that will be followed in play.<br/>\n2. GM looks at the type of characters, and gives some thought to how they will plug into the plot. Usually by means of a "hook." <br/>\n3. GM builds "encounters" which are locations or scenes that exist for the PCs to run into where they will be challenged based on their skills. The GM tailors these encounters to these skills so as to make the characters seem cool. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis should be pretty familiar to everyone. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn CCP, however, the GM doesn't pull the characters into the plot, he makes events that wrap around the characters, so that the players can create the plot:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. The GM looks at the character sheet, or discusses with the player to discover "flags." Basically he determines what it is that interests the player about playing the character. <br/>\n2. The GM creates a "situation" comprised of NPCs and events, etc, that will come to the character and "grab" the player (I'll explain how this differs from a "hook" below). <br/>\n<br/>\nNote that the process is essentially reversed. We don't think of the plot first, and then to include the characters. In fact we don't think of a plot at all. Instead we think about the character, and then just make life interesting for the character directly. This is the part that's hard to wrap your head around. We make life interesting not in terms of having the character go through a plot, but in terms of having events occur which, through player decisions about their character actions, allows the player to create plot.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf this still doesn't sound different, that's because it's hard to explain. But the difference is not just real, but substantial in play. In fact, it's so different that often players that are used to SPP won't realize that the change is in effect, and will react oddly to CCP because they don't understand the paradigm at all. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'll give an example, to make this clear:<br/>\n<br/>\nSPP - I have a player Jon, with a character named Ragnar, who is a vicious barbarian. I look out on the internet, and find an "adventure" called The Dark Crypt, which is an interesting read. But it's got too much "theif" stuff. So I alter it so that it's more a series of straight up fights, since that's what Ragnar is all about. Then I use one of the "hooks" provided in the text - the lure of gold in the crypt. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe play it, and have a great time. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCCP - I have a player Jon, with a character named Ragnar, who is a vicious barbarian. I talk more with Jon, and look at what he's written on the character sheet, and see that he's really interested in how the book says that the tribe he's in is always in a fight for their lives against these rampaging hordes of orcs. So I create Ragnar's village, with several NPCs, including ones that he's got in his background, especially his family. <br/>\n<br/>\nI then use Chris Chinn's "Central Conflict" method, and decide that the conflict around which events will resolve is an impending attack by the orcs. So I "Grab" Jon (not Ragnar), by appealing to the player's apparent concern with Ragnar's village - an attack is happening, Ragnar will not be Ragnar should he not respond in some way to the attack. But instead of making the actual orc attack the issue of play, I have the situation such that there are factions in the village, some of whom want to stand and fight, and another who want to flee. Then the village elder comes to Ragnar and asks him to mediate between the sides, and, really, to decide the main issue at hand - fight or flight. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhatever the player decides, that's where the plot goes, and subsequent action will develop as ramifications of the character's decision. Not in terms of a tree of decisions (like a "choose your own adventure" book), but taking the player's exact intent into account. Perhaps the player decides to send some of the people in the village away, but stays to fight with some of the others. An unforseen choice. I go with that. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe continue to play out the situation, and have a great time. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully you can see the difference now. With SPP, you "hook" characters into the action - basically you say, "Here's something your character should be interested in - take the bait, or there'll be no adventure tonight" (that sounds harsher than I mean it, it's quite a functional method to play by). With CCP, you "Grab" the player by his interest in the character, and let him decide where to take that interest, saying, "Here's something that you said you were interested in investigating... what do you want to do with that, and where are we going?" <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce play is onging with SPP, you force the prepared "encounters" to occur (even if that means not having anything else for them to do), and eventually get to the end of your pre-planned plot. With CCP, you make up environmental responses to the actions of the PCs, and the plot ends up having an end that surprises everyone. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt all starts with the "Dungeon" and having a set of encounters in D&amp;D. Later RPGs evolved to having "plots" instead of dungeons, but the player still had to conform to the prepared materials. Now we have "Relationship Maps" and such where the player still has only so much stuff to react to, but can take it in any direction they like. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust another option, and hopefully people can see the difference that I'm trying to describe. People have long said that they're creating "Character-centric" adventures, but rarely have they really been so. Usually that means that you include some sort of sub-plot in your overall plot that involves the PC via hook. Which is really not anywhere as "character-centric" as play can be. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNote that this paradigm has been used by people for ages, it's just usually been relegated to use by people doing freeform, relatively rare in TTRPG play. Also note that it's not "winging it." There are ways to prepare thoroughly for this sort of play that don't come down to plot-preparation. And CCP can be just as GM intensive as SPP. Just a couple of common misconceptions. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_86122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/1of3" title="1of3"><img alt="1of3" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/1of3">1of3</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86122/#Comment_86122" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-07T10:38:08+00:00" title="August  7, 2007 10:38AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 7, 2007 10:38AM by 1of3.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">I would like to categorize encounters so that I can then go down the character sheets and tick off how much focus each player put in that are, compare that to the total amount of points/feat slots/whatevers spent, and use that data to generate rough percentages for encounters.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nIntrigue<br/>\nPurely magical<br/>\nArtistic<br/>\nBoard games / card games<br/>\nCar chase<br/>\nDog fights<br/>\nPokemons<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOr maybe another system?<br/>\n<br/>\n- vs. named foes<br/>\n- vs. unnamed foes<br/>\n- vs. nature<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n- lethal encounters<br/>\n- non-lethal, but maybe costly encounters<br/>\n- encounters without repercussions<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n- myself vs. opposition<br/>\n- party vs. opposition<br/>\n- party and allies vs. opposition<br/>\n- myself vs. other PC                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86139">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

I com to the sessions with some stuff prepared, because if I don't my players will (sometimes) flounder. However, at some point during the evening the direction I thought we'd head and the direction they actually head veer apart from one another. We go their route.<br><br>In general, my "adventures" revolve around what the PCs want to do, where they want to go, and what happens before, during, and after their visit. Sometimes the "where" is a dungeon, sometimes a social scene, and sometimes a mass combat between demons and god-powered Lawgivers.<br><br>I don't think that "hooking into the characters' actions" requires that I completely throw aware prior plot preparation. If it does, it's useless to me because my players sometimes (perhaps even often) need somewhere to start. Sometimes (perhaps often) I'm the same way when I play.\n<blockquote>"Here's something that you said you were interested in investigating... what do you want to do with that, and where are we going?" </blockquote>\nThis is our style, or at least how it evolves once the ball gets rolling. But eventually that storyline plays out, and some of the time they haven't demonstrated a clear direction.<br><br>Also, I'm not talking about how I want to design the overall story arc. I do that by brainstorming, changing things at a moment's notice, and trying not to weep openly when the amazing ideas I had are ignored by the PCs in favor of routes I never contemplated. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br><br>what I'm talking about is how to build my scenarios (sometimes dungeon, sometimes not).

As defined by <a href="http://random.average-bear.com/TheoryTopics/Flags" rel="nofollow">RandomWiki</a>:\n<blockquote>Flags are elements of a character sheet that let/cause a player to indicate to a Gamemaster what type of issues, color, and or challenge they would like to see in the game.</blockquote>\nMy barb's Power Attack feat chain doesn't really tell you anything about issues or color, and only a smidge about challenge. And is my buddy putting ranks in Bluff because he wants lots of social interaction during play, or because he's planning to give his PC Improved Feint? Not to mention that lot of D&amp;D chargen involves choosing optimal combos, which can be an end in itself.<br/><br/>My point (and I think Chris', though I can't speak for him) is that using these things as Flags is imperfect at best.

When we switch back to D&amp;D, if I'm the GM, I'll definitely break the combat category up into "CR &lt; Level" and "CR &gt;= Level."<br/><br/>Thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_86916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray" title="James McMurray"><img alt="James McMurray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray">James McMurray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86916/#Comment_86916" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-09T08:12:42+00:00" title="August  9, 2007  8:12AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 9, 2007 8:31AM by James McMurray.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a little undecided about what to do with the War category. While they have no special abilities that are specifically focuse on War, and only a few have any War skill, they also have a commander with strong skill, and everyone can contribute because there is a lot of overlap between War and Physical combat. That makes that 1% somewhat misleading, as it makes it appear that War is a weak spot, when in an actual mass combat they tend to stomp major booty.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny ideas on how better to model war? Just lumping in the combat focused stuff and adding them to the War skill ranks would also be misleading, as a large part of their apparent focus on war is coincidental with their focus on regular fights.<br/>\n<br/>\nedit: the system is Exalted, if that spurs any ideas. But I'd like to keep the categories as generic as possible, so any ideas would be appreciated.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
