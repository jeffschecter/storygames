The players were pretty pleased, and there was a fair bit of talk about where things are still weak, where they're now stronger in actual play, and so on.  Good stuff.  Vices were simply cut, along with the two colors of tokens.  A lot of niggling details were cleaned up, and so on.  It's still not at the point where I want to wave it around again online; I know where to work, and when that's done, I'll ask again if people see any more details that need adressing.<br/><br/>Second.  That link to Pocketmods that got put up in the mini-book thread?  My players have <i>always </i>been handing in sheets that are folded into eighths, so I built a pocketmod sheet.   They love these.  A lot.  And then I discovered something fun - if you put a staple in the spine of a pocketmod, and then another at the very bottom of the first 'page', you get a pocket inside that fits business cards perfectly - and business cards are what the game uses for item chits.  This is supercool.  By tossing one of those big black paperclamps on top at the end of an event, players can then just toss their stuff in a bin, and the "filing" is done.<br/><br/>Third.  I went shopping, inspired by all those threads on "awesome game kits".  A ballot-box for site fees.  A little stand for rulebooks.  A lot of danish butter cookies, in tins (I repainted the tins as my new token bowls, and will be eating the cookies for weeks to come).  Setup and cleanup are way, way faster as a result, and I don't need to resort everything once it gets home.<br/><br/>All in all?  We had an even better game.  You helped.<br/><br/>Thought you might like to know.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68714/#Comment_68714" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-12T14:55:54+00:00" title="May 12, 2007  2:55PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool. ^_^                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
