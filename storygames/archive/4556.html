I have had some advice from the guys over at the collective endeavour as to pacing and character creation and would like to know what you folks though on the former.<br/><br/>The scenario is going to centre around 4 irish brothers whose father is killed by the Mafia. The game will focus on how they take their revenge. <br/><br/>Pacing wise I am going with the advice of Joe Prince who said I should go for this structure:<br/><br/>Crisis: Death of Father<br/>Bang<br/>Bang<br/>Bang<br/>Confrontation: With hitman, lieutenant who ordered the hit or the boss of the mafia in town depending on how well they have done.<br/><br/>I am reckoning it will take about 30mins to explain the setup and all the stuff on their character sheet. Then about 30 mins to go through the first scene which will include their father's death and a small skirmish so they get a feel for the way the rules work. The game will then progress from bang to bang fairly quickly keeping the pace high and interesting. I don't want to go into too many details here in case any of the potential players are reading this site.<br/><br/>Does this seem about right? Any general advice on running games at cons?<br/><br/>Cheers<br/><br/>Iain                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103097/#Comment_103097" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-15T11:13:16+00:00" title="October 15, 2007 11:13AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd say 30 minutes to get to play is 25 minutes too long. That's a lot of sitting around listening, and there's a good chance you'll lose your audience. Attention or engagement is a _commodity_. <br/><br/>You're much more likely to give me ten minutes of your times than J Random Stranger. That's because in our previous interactions, I've built up a little bank of your attention. So with your players (who you probably won't know), you need to buy their attention quickly, and then use that as leverage for the less engaging bits of the session.<br/><br/>Listening to a GM - any GM - talk about their rules system is not interesting. It's abstract. It doesn't immediately inform play. And it's not a debate or a collaboration, it's one-directional.<br/><br/>The setup should be a two minute job, if that. You're brothers. This is what you stand for. This is what you have. These are the tensions between you. The world is bam-bam-bam. Your dad is bleeding out in front of you. Fucksocks!<br/><br/>Once the group react to that, you've got commitment. Add some more bangs and keep the pace up and you can ten rely on your players paying attention during the quiet bits. You'll have earned their trust.<br/><br/>If the combat system isn't as quick as a roll or two (total), I'd suggest you avoid it until much later in the game. Instead, hit people with bangs to get them reacting and deciding, and to hint at the setting and its dynamics. Depending on how their dear oul' da dies, this would be a good place for chase rolls, interrogation rolls and snap shots. The circumstances of his death should challenge the players. Hiding the body, pressuring a witness, that sort of thing.<br/><br/>Bangs and weaves should briskly follow.<br/><br/>And later on, you can take 5 minutes to explain a rules system. Theres a good chance that the players will *need* a 5 minute breather, so everyone wins.<br/><br/>You're an excellent gamer. You have crazy amounts of manic energy. Your enthusiasm is infectious. Use these to buy the players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ihmcallister" title="ihmcallister"><img alt="ihmcallister" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ihmcallister">ihmcallister</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103116/#Comment_103116" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-15T14:38:26+00:00" title="October 15, 2007  2:38PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good advice their Joe.

Let them find out how the bits on the character sheet interact during play, rather than giving them stuff they have to remember beforehand. I'm sure your enthusiasm and keen-ness will get people rolling along nicely within the first couple of minutes. All you need to do is say "You're brothers, you're gangsters. BANG! Pappy is dead and what the hell are you going to do about it?" As characters, they start off right in the middle of a situation that demands action. As players, they have to ivestigate that character sheet to find out how to take that action.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malcolm                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Shevaun" title="Shevaun"><img alt="Shevaun" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Shevaun">Shevaun</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103125/#Comment_103125" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-15T15:52:14+00:00" title="October 15, 2007  3:52PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you open with a nice simple conflict that's part of the story, you can both get them involved and show them the system at the same time.

So when a player says 'how do I shoot the cop point-blank?', then they're going to pay attention to the copkilling rules. It's directly applicable. And players are only going to pick up a third of the rules, anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ihmcallister" title="ihmcallister"><img alt="ihmcallister" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ihmcallister">ihmcallister</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103264/#Comment_103264" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-16T11:09:18+00:00" title="October 16, 2007 11:09AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just about done with setting out how I want things to go in my head, and I have finished fleshing out all the characters details.
