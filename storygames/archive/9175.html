Games like paranoia, violence, kill puppies for satan, certain D&amp;D supplements with lots of interesting flavor text. You know, an RPG that I can enjoy for its own sake without playing it. Of course, the point of an RPG is to play, so I do want a good game and all being said and done I'd rather have a great game to play than a great game to read, but at the same time I'd rather have a decent game to read than a decent game to play, since I don't want to waste my very limited RPG time with a decent as opposed to excellent game, but I have plenty of reading books time that I can spend on a game with reading value.<br/><br/>Anyways, what do you guys think of games that have "reading value" do you think it takes away from or somehow obscures the parts you need to play, or is it worth it for that extra entertainment value you get out of reading it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202944/#Comment_202944" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-21T09:34:26+00:00" title="April 21, 2009  9:34AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Depends!

I don't believe that a book written in a "manual" style can't be entertaining. Hell, WEG Paranoia was pretty classic as a manual that was hilarious to read. As an editor for Misspent Youth, I helped Rob make his entertaining, attitude-laden style more consistent. He had these lapses into sesquipedalian doldrum that elicited my margin comments like, "Rob, you need to say 'fuck' here a lot more." <br/><br/>As a writer, the tension is between saying clearly what you want readers to learn and entertaining the reader with prosaic wanderings away from the rules. I tend to get heavily procedural when I write down my rules. "You do this. And then you do this. And if this happens, you do this." Oh, sorry. Did I just put you to sleep?<br/><br/>Game writers need to find a voice that can entertain while nailing down the procedure. The voice needs to go with the material, too. Rob Bohl's "fuck the police" voice in Misspent Youth was perfect for his neo-punk dark future game but would be out of place in -- fuck, I dunno -- let's say, The Princess Game. Use your voice to convey mood. <br/><br/>Does this voice stuff distract a reader from the rules? Not if done well. Don't overdo it. Trim away the excess fat, but leave enough for flavor once the reader tosses the game on the barbecue of his mind. Use metaphors -- preferably not all about barbecues -- to make your points in interesting ways. Which are you gonna remember? The rule that says, "Remove excess florid prose, but leave enough to keep the reader's interest" or the barbecue analogy?<br/><br/>There's also a point of salesmanship here. Like any good book, you are trying to hook the reader. Don't fill the beginning of your game text with soporific lullabies, like a dull "what is roleplaying" section. If you must write a "what is roleplaying" section, by all means, make it the most exciting thing in the game! Or hide it in a sidebar on page 12. The first page should be gripping. You are trying to convince the reader to read the rest of the section, then the rest of the chapter, then the rest of the book. You are trying to get your audience to pick up the book, read some of it, read all of it, and then play it. <br/><br/>In the writing and editing process, pick up your book and see it through the eyes of a novice. Would you pick this book up? Would you read it? Read the back cover. Would you buy it? Read the first page. Would you want to read more or would you flip-flip-flip through to something more interesting? If you're flipping through your own material, cut it or rewrite it.<br/><br/>I think we can do a lot to raise the level of art and craftsman ship in our game writing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_202966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202966/#Comment_202966" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-21T10:26:24+00:00" title="April 21, 2009 10:26AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I generally prefer manuals, albeit written in a style to give the flavour of the game.<br/><br/>If it's written for reading purposes, it's got to be bloody good.

Graphic elements should enhance the text, never get in the way of it.</blockquote>\nI tend to be on the sneering-at-pictures side of this argument more often than not, but this is an excellent, excellent point that I agree with whenever I can muster up the strength to think about it rationally.<br/><br/>When I'm flipping through a book, pictures are a navigation tool.  I know that character creation rules are AFTER the picture of the zeppelin crashing into King Kong's face, I know that the advice section is on the same page as Tyrone Powers kissing Vecna with full tongue action, I know that if I see the illustration of a burning tent surrounded by shoggoths giving their equivalent of a thumbs up "we did it!" pose that I'm close to the table for falling damage...that sort of thing.  On the level of me not giving a shit about what foofy (not to mention probably misguided and useless to me) atmosphere the art is meant to evoke, I <i>still</i> get value from the art, just in terms of having an instinctive split-second map of where I am in the text, so I can use my thinking brain for more important shit than memorizing page numbers and chapter headings.<br/><br/>That said, I am less inclined to sneer at the pictures for their content if they are actually illustrating and enhancing the text rather than attempting to deliver a foofy, misguided, and useless sense of atmosphere to me.  Fuck that noise.  Show me what specific things look like in the setting: what do the spaceships look like, what does a city look like, how do people dress?  When you say that the soldiers all wield man-portable assault cannons, what does an assault cannon actually look like?  What does a Bigby's Expressive Finger spell look like?<br/><br/><br/>And on the topic of entertainment versus manual, manual trumps entertainment.  I'm getting the book to make my own entertainment, to use it in a game: if the book's trying to entertain me instead of teaching me the tools and techniques to play the game, it is a huge, epic failure and a waste of my money, because I can get any great novel I want for well under $10 at a bookstore, or for free at my local library.  I don't want a twenty-page short story at the front of the book: it's wasted space that could've been used to give me more tools and cool things that I could actually use in the game.  I don't want three pages of funny jokes if those funny jokes can't make my game better.  <br/><br/>That said, a good manual uses entertainment to enhance the information it presents.  Boring manuals are not as good as entertaining ones, either as instructional tools or resources.  So once the "manual" part is firmly nailed down, then by all means there ought to be some entertainment value added on top of it.  But, like art, it should be there to enhance the text, not get in the way of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_203054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr" title="Kevin Allen Jr"><img alt="Kevin Allen Jr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr">Kevin Allen Jr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203054/#Comment_203054" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-21T18:32:57+00:00" title="April 21, 2009  6:32PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to go out on a limb here and maybe alienate some folks.

You're probably boring (that's a supposition) and you've missed the point of the hobby entirely (that feels a little more like an empirical truth). This is an entertainment medium. If you would rather read the installation guide for you DVD player than watch movies on it thats fine. But I don't really ever want to play a game with you. <br/><br/>And that's OK. You probably don't want to play a game with me either. I'm pretentious and wholly biased against your opinions. Also, I just called you boring and told you that you don't have even a basic understand something that you clearly care a lot about. I've been kind of a jerk.<br/><br/>So we don't want to play games with each other, where does that leave us. Well it means we're going to have to find other players. Here's where I stop being a jerk and start to have an opinion that should actually impact some creator decision-making, and answers the OP's question. <br/><br/>Manual style books aren't going to attract any new players into this hobby. That greatly increases the chances of you having to play games with guys you don't like from the internet. No one wants that. And I think it's fair to say we all want fresh new people to grow our hobby. <br/><br/>There's nothing wrong with having the opinion that technical manuals make better game reading experiences, but if you are applying that opinion to the actual game making process, and generating works in that style, you are doing something that's sort of toxic to the hobby. <br/><br/>Don't do that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_203057">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203057/#Comment_203057" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-21T19:31:00+00:00" title="April 21, 2009  7:31PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 21, 2009 7:37PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kevin Allen Jr</cite>If you game isn't an interesting read (that includes the inclusion of good art, and professional layout) it isn't worth the stock it's printed on.</blockquote>\nI'm guessing you'd agree that if your game doesn't actually give useful and intelligible advice, information, instruction, and other manual-type features, it would <i>also</i> not be worth the stock it's printed on?

It boggles my mind that somebody who is presumably passionate about his hobby of roleplaying would find a text of instruction (a manual, if you will) about it boring - why do this thing if you don't like it? Or rather, how come your excitement about roleplaying does not translate into a curiosity about game texts, but you still buy and try to read them? Thus I'm firmly of the mind that having to bribe people to read your manual by adding parallel entertainment is just screwy - I'll write a book that is not a game instruction manual if I want to entertain you with non-roleplaying content. Something like... a Japanese-style replay, I guess, if you're still committed to pretending that it's the roleplaying that you're interested in and not just fantasy fiction. (Might not even be pretense, hypothetical play is a well-established phenomenon wherein people like the idea of roleplaying more than the actual act.)<br/><br/>I do know many people who do roleplaying but don't care about it enough to buy and read expert texts, preferring to learn games and techniques from others by the way of instruction and example. In fact, these people are a 5:1 majority among roleplayers in my experience. It shouldn't be surprising, considering how non-readers don't buy games, if I choose not to make them my target audience when writing rpg texts.<br/><br/>Looking at this from the other side, however (and proving that I don't really understand the whole premise of the discussion): it seems obvious to me that a good rpg manual, being a book of instruction on a practice advocated by the author, will do its best to paint the exercise itself in a positive, engaging and entertaining light. So ideally you'd find that manual engaging to read because you're interested in the activity it explains, all thanks to how it's been written in an entertaining manner - which is being done because the author wants you to become motivated to actually play. So this whole distinction between being a good read and being a good game seems screwy to me; how can it be a good game if it doesn't motivate you to play, and how can it not be a good read for a rpg hobbyist if it does?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_203065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203065/#Comment_203065" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-21T23:28:44+00:00" title="April 21, 2009 11:28PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Anyone think this is a false dichotomy?

When we talk about "good" and "evil" we naturally gravitate to the most overt, uniform examples for each and avoid the messy grey areas in the middle.  It's just easier to talk about things that way.<br/><br/>In this case, I think the real meat is in looking at this as a matter of <i>priorities</i> rather than as an either-or proposition: when you actually read a book that is (as all RPG books tend to be) in the grey area between book-as-entertainment and book-as-manual, which part of that mix appeals to you more?  When you say "that's an awesome RPG book!", are you more likely to be praising its entertaining features or its instructional/reference quality?<br/><br/>Because that's actually a preference that people have in real life: the things that you dwell on when you think about the RPG book that you love and all the things you love about it.  I would go so far as to say that no normal person anywhere would say "I want this RPG book I spent $50 on to be a long and wonderful novel with gorgeous art that doesn't tell me diddly-squat about how to actually play the game" or "I want this RPG book I spent $50 on to be a scrupulously clear instruction manual for the game with absolutely no interesting or entertaining style to it whatsoever."  You want it to be a mix of the two, you want it to be a GOOD mix of the two, but it's conceivable that one part of that good mix might be just a wee bit more valuable in your mind when it comes time to pick favorites.<br/><br/><br/>Me, I tend to lean towards the manual side, because I get so much entertainment from so many other things that I just don't see RPG books as valid competition in that arena.  The novels I read, the movies I see, the TV I watch...they all tend to do a better job of pure entertainment than the best RPG book I've ever read.  I'm not saying I hate RPG books that strive to be entertaining -- that's far from the case -- but I am saying that how entertaining the book might be is slightly less important to my "This is awesome!"-o-meter than how <i>useful</i> I find it in making an entertaining game happen when I sit down to actually play.  Because in THAT arena, novels and movies and TV do a flat-out shitty job of describing a game to me: they might provide inspiration, but precious little in the way of instruction or advice, while RPG books can excel at both of those things.<br/><br/>Manual-ness being equal, I'll give the nod to the more entertaining RPG book.  But if the manual end is weak, the entertainment's not going to make up for it where I'm concerned.  I'm assuming that for other people in this thread, the reverse would be true, that a less entertaining book will not satisfy them even if it is a clearer manual than most other RPGs they've read.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_203082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203082/#Comment_203082" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-22T05:52:37+00:00" title="April 22, 2009  5:52AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I find it interesting that people give their opinion based on the false dichotomy, then point out that it is one.

Always.  Every. One.  Not because I'm bored, but just because that's how I read RPG books.  If it's a "trad" game, like D&amp;D or something from White Wolf, I probably glance at the introduction and then flip through through "kewl p0werz" section, cuz I like that shit.  If it's a digest-sized 30 page indie game, well, then i guess there's a chance i might read it cover to cover, but i'll probably end up flipping around just out of habit if nothing else.  but basically for me, reading cover to cover is for novels, not for RPG books.  i also think flipping around helps me get a sense of where everything is in a book more quickly, without needing to read it all, thus allowing me to potentially make use of it, or some of it, as a reference at the table (this mostly only applies if it's a supplement to a game.  i'm not going to try to run something without having read the entire core anyway.  oh wait, that's not really true.  i take it back.)<br/>Anyway.  Flipping around doesn't equal being bored for me.  It's possible i'm some extreme statistical outlier, but i doubt it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_203096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203096/#Comment_203096" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-22T08:25:26+00:00" title="April 22, 2009  8:25AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 22, 2009 8:28AM by chearns.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hate falling asleep reading a game book.

So, the shorter the better. I guess the idea is, as short as possible, but no shorter. Certainly fiction that is longer than a couple of paragraphs just never works for me, I will without a doubt skip it (micro, flash, or vignette are short enough to keep my attention). If the only way to play the game is by absorbing and repeating the fiction, then the game will be quickly tossed aside as I won't understand how to play (or why to play).<br/><br/>Quite frankly, I generally like illustrations not for the illustrations, but rather for their layout functions. And yes, a well layed out book helps.<br/><br/>After that, like I said regarding Dirty Secrets, I like a Reference Manual where I can look up the rules, and then a User Guide, to explain how to use the rules in order to have fun.

That means I prefer things to be clear and relatively short.  Also, I really hate flipping through books while I'm trying to play something, so all the manual-type reference stuff should come on a couple sheets that I can print out and use as needed or be summarized on a couple pages of the book that I can photocopy and have on hand.  <i>Roleplaying texts that require players to use them as reference books during play have failed in their task of presenting information in a helpful, usable manner.</i><br/><br/>However, if your game is more fun to read than it is to play, something is also wrong.  I recently had this experience where flipping through Rob Bohl's amazing layout for the ashcan of <i>Misspent Youth</i> and going through the kick-ass character creation process was a lot more fun than my experience of play once the game actually started.  Hopefully Rob can fix that or maybe we just had an off-day, playtest-wise.  You don't want to be like, uh, Rifts or something, where the pictures and flavor text and kick-ass Ramon Perez comics about the game are way, way cooler than actually playing the game.

For one, I think it only applies to short games (page count-wise).  If games have a lot of rules or a great deal of complexity, well not everyone is capable of memorizing everything, and some people (like me) wouldn't want to try to memorize it all even if they could.  Do you even do <i>Mouse Guard</i> without ever referencing the text at the table?  Plus, if you play or read multiple games, you might get some stuff mixed up, and need to reference the rules for that reason.  Finally, if you agree that some games just have too much <i>stuff</i> to keep it all in your head, it's a matter of taste as to whether that's bad and a failure or not.<br/>However, regardless of whether a particular game <i>requires</i> reference to the book at the table, I want that book to be easy to use as a reference if necessary.  I hate it when I can't find stuff in a book quickly if a rules disagreement should occur.  This is my biggest complaint about the style of IaWA.  It was great for reading the first time and learning how to play, but when I wanted to reference it because I couldn't quite remember how a certain thing was supposed to work, I had a hell of a time finding a clear statement of rule for something I was sure existed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_203106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203106/#Comment_203106" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-22T09:08:45+00:00" title="April 22, 2009  9:08AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ideally, I think the game should teach the game.<br/>However close you can get to this, using whatever possible means you have.<br/>This kinda thing appears to be easier with electronic games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_203107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203107/#Comment_203107" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-22T09:10:34+00:00" title="April 22, 2009  9:10AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll toss some fuel on the fire and say that, while I like SOME "setting fiction," I find it's FAR more interesting to read actual play examples, which (if good) should ALSO be game fiction.<br/><br/>Art should evoke the game's mood, but it can also provide faster reference ("picture worth a thousand words"), in particular with things like flowcharts and gameplay forms.

That is to say, unless you're good enough to be shortlisted for the Booker or some other such award, odds are I don't want to read more than a handful of paragraphs of your prose, sorry.<br/><br/>Length is an issue for me with most mediums though. I will be more inclined to enjoy a movie that is an hour and a half long over one of three hours (I fell asleep during LotR and Scarface). I like shorter novels over longer novels. I like six episode seasons more than 22 episode seasons. I like half hour albums more than hour long albums.<br/><br/>These aren't one hundred percentisms. There are double albums I like. There are three hour movies I enjoy. And I'm sure somewhere out there is the three hundred page Instruction Manuel for an RPG that I will be glued to until I finish reading it (Amber comes pretty close).<br/><br/>******<br/><br/>I remember another thing in UA I wasn't able to get through, the two page plus lists of things you have heard or believe at X level of play. Ack. In essence, it felt to me like they turned thirty pages into three hundred (kind of like how Scarface had about sixty minutes too much film, or WALL-E forty-five).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_203166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203166/#Comment_203166" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-22T13:48:28+00:00" title="April 22, 2009  1:48PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: chearns</cite><br/>I remember another thing in UA I wasn't able to get through, the two page plus lists of things you have heard or believe at X level of play.

Exhaustive index, table of context, fluff and rules distinct, and meaningful artwork that helps reinforce organization of the book.  I'm tired of big half-page drawings that look half-baked.  A sense of restraint in the fiction/setting pieces is good as well.  Beyond that, the game seems to determine what the text should look like.  A game that has a setting should try to communicate it using both versatility <i>and </i>restraint; tone of the text, font, pictures, fluff, whatever.  But a game that builds its setting on the fly using a  procedure should probably read more as a procedural manual with the odd diagram thrown in, plus wingdings for rules elements.<br/><br/>But it seems like some of the comments above are aimed more at what kind of game people would play rather than what book they would read.  They seem linked to me.<br/><br/>[edit]: wait, did I answer the question?  More like a manual it seems, but my favorite tends to be in-character manuals.  Not always appropriate, but fun.  Would that I could see with untainted eyes the rpg books I read, instead of bringing to them my own apparatus of deconstruction, but alas, innocence is lost forever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_203184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203184/#Comment_203184" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-22T14:59:16+00:00" title="April 22, 2009  2:59PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wolfe</cite> I tried briefly, so as to not wander too far off-topic, to suggest that false-dichotomies can be useful in soliciting opinions and teasing out ideas, as I think has happened in this thread.

Forget flavor text, pictures, or the complete absence of instruction or entertainment.<br/><br/>So then: do you prefer your RPG texts (whether you consider them books, manuals, tomes, whatever) to be written with a voice or to be simply instructive? <br/><br/>Obviously every writer, even those who write flat out instructions use a voice, but I'm talking something where it's more obviously infused with the writer's style, or one where things tend to stick to more focused depiction of rules (not to say there isn't entertainment, but maybe its separate or something)<br/><br/>Ugh.

And if someone is thumbing through your book it's going to make it a lot more appealing if you've made the text awesome in some way, because they don't know how the game plays yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_203252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/simjames" title="simjames"><img alt="simjames" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i41.tinypic.com/14kutg3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/simjames">simjames</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203252/#Comment_203252" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-23T07:18:57+00:00" title="April 23, 2009  7:18AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like a bit of both, but in general I err on the side of "reads like a book". Rolemaster is way too dry for me, for example, even though I understand the rules and have played quite a bit of the game. It's fortunate that I learned to play RM from my group at the time, because I'd have struggled with the manuals.<br/><br/>At the other extreme, I just can't get into Nobilis. My attention wanders.<br/><br/>My preferred style is "conversational" - games like Jonathon Tweet's Everway or Greg Stolze's REIGN are exemplars of that style. They're definitely instructions about how to play the game, but they're also pleasant (and not-too-dense) reading. I understood both games - how to make characters, how gameplay is structured, why the rules are as they are - after a single read-through. I admit that I skipped the setting-specific sections of REIGN, but I was always planning to use that engine for other vehicles.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Do you prefer your RPGs to read like books or manuals? - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9175/do-you-prefer-your-rpgs-to-read-like-books-or-manuals/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Do you prefer your RPGs to read like books or manuals? - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9175/do-you-prefer-your-rpgs-to-read-like-books-or-manuals/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="My rich friend who buys games buys them almost exclusively based on imagery and fiction.

When I'm done reading a game book, I ask myself a few questions:<br/><br/>1) Do I understand how to play? Can I make a character, arbitrate basic rules disputes, generate a story/adventure/game session?<br/>2) Can I explain how the <i>game</i> works to others? Can I say "generally you are rolling two dice and keeping the highest" or "you are rolling a pool of d6 and adding to beat 10" or whatever?<br/>3) Can I sell my players on it? Can I say "this game is about sky-pirates" or "pulp heroics" or "mice with swords" or whatever? If the concept is not one that they are immediately keen on, is there anything that -is- exciting/unique in mechanics or gameplay that will hook them anyway, a la <i>Burning Wheel</i>: "Yeah, it's fantasy with elves and orcs, but the character creation system is awesome, and I think you'll like how it rewards you for playing up your character motivation".<br/><br/>Basically, this means I want my first read-through to be both stylish AND informative, but moreso the latter, since as the primary buyer of new RPGs (I mean new in the sense of "games that my group has not played before"), I have to be able to summarize and synthesize all the crunch AND all the fluff, and put it into a package that my group will be attracted to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_203567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203567/#Comment_203567" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-25T16:47:11+00:00" title="April 25, 2009  4:47PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>I hate this statement so much, I had to quote it, just so I could see it again and be filled with hate.</blockquote>\nSeconded.<br/><br/>P.S., Never hang out on the HERO forums if you hate these sorts of quotes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_203570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203570/#Comment_203570" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-25T18:23:56+00:00" title="April 25, 2009  6:23PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 25, 2009 6:34PM by komradebob.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>My rich friend who buys games buys them almost exclusively based on imagery and fiction.

Preferably ones that are quick reads, and that are amenable to skipping around.<br/><br/>One quality that I think helps with skipping around is good organization:  everything you need to know about a particular thing (say, skill checks) can be found in the same section of the book, covers all the important info, and is signposted/landmarked well enough to find it in a hurry.  Bonus points if it's something I can pass across the table to someone else and know that they can read the section for themselves quickly and with a minimum of "wha...huh?" questions.  Bonus bonus points if they already prep a cheat sheet section at the back that lays out the rules and game procedures clearly and quickly, so I can just steal it or maybe even xerox it completely and pass it out to the group.<br/><br/><br/>I used to read gaming books cover-to-cover, but as I've gotten older and more jaded and busier with real life, I tend to save my good sitting-around-and-reading time for novels or other "real" books.  I don't have the patience to slog through a whole manual, or even a whole section, so manuals that let me swoop in and easily grab onto the good stuff and then go away to do something else are precious to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_203588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203588/#Comment_203588" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-26T08:16:28+00:00" title="April 26, 2009  8:16AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Manuals.<br/><br/>Had this idea the other day: to make a manual for my game <i>Fabula, </i>with each single page having enough stuff to support one or more scenarios ...<br/><br/>And then I thought up another one; a scenario-book with one scenario on each page.
