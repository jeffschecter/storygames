I am working on a game that can emulate battles in shonen anime. Even if my game does not work out, at least I can say that I tried to create something that emulates shonen games. I am trying to handle powerlevels such as Bleach and Dragonball Z without too much math.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow it works<br/>\nGrades, bursts and abilities<br/>\nGrades- Determine the relative strength of a character within the scope of a particular season.<br/>\nBursts- Bursts are the altered states our heroes often get into when they are in extreme trouble. They range from Extreme Rage, to boosted reflexes. They are triggered only one time during a game day and of course, a game day can be as long as the story needs it to be. Stronger characters often get more than one burst but all player characters and important NPCs start with one.<br/>\nAbilities- The meat of the game is in abilities. They are the 'powers, techniques, etc/  that your characters can do. The GM will need to decide which abilities fit their setting but I will say that I am working on having powers that are not necessarily combat in nature. That way, a very charismatic character can still hold their own in a fight. As your character gets stronger, their abilities get stronger as well.<br/>\nPower stat- the main stat that controls how much power a character has is called Spirit. This number is a total of 100% and will not get higher. Bursts and healing items can restore Spirit, but ultimately it will take time to restore.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow I am going to handle power creep.<br/>\nOne thing about my game is that I am trying to find a way to cover power creep. The idea I came up with works with the grade level concept I had. Grades are subjective only to the current season. Characters who move on from 1 season to the next loose their current grade level but are still considerably more powerful compared to past villains and NPC's. They only "lose" grade levels to scale back the power within the scope of the new campaign. Characters who do not advance with the campaign will be eventually written out of the story. Why do character's grade level change? With shonen anime, new enemies who are much more powerful than the last always arrive on the scene. Instead of the numbers in the game getting larger, the characters are scaled back compared to each other.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213464/#Comment_213464" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-19T13:50:44+00:00" title="June 19, 2009  1:50PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting!

Thanks for the tip! I am not too familiar with amber's bidding mechanic. how does that work (or do i need a copy of Amber)?<br/>\n<br/>\nGrades relative to each other from one season to the next. So far, the idea i had was that everyone would effectively drop levels. Between seasons, the GM determines just how powerful the new advesary is (*working on exact method) and assigns them a grade. The heroes would start the new session accordingly. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance Tardus beat the first round of powerfighters. He ends the adventure at Grade A. The next group of powerfighters are only marginally stronger (filler season).*edit We decide to make the new group of villians Grade A and to reduce the strongest hero a few levels. In this example we decide to lower everyone 2 levels. Tardus coming into the Filler season would be considered Grade C and everyone else would be two grades lower with regards to the new season. If there are any characters who are still alive and not central to the plot, the grade level drain could force them into bit roles or cameo's.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213484/#Comment_213484" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-19T14:32:30+00:00" title="June 19, 2009  2:32PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The short version of the Amber mechanics: Characters had X amount of points that they could then bid to see who was the best at Warfare, Strength, etc. Whoever bid the most got the highest rank.<br/><br/>Yeah, what you're saying makes sense.

I was writting a martial arts game, and it had a lot of extra, non-combat stuff. And I realized that no one would take the non-combat stuff unless they had to, and it didn't come up too often, anyway.<br/><br/>I'd say that each player gets X number of non-combat traits. These are things that they're really good at, and nearly always succeed on. They may also have things they're particularly bad at - Goku might be a decent guy, but he still fails whenever Chi-Chi's arguing with him. And they would nearly always fail on these.<br/><br/>Everything else, they're about as good as anyone else.<br/><br/>The exception to all of this is when another character tries to interfere - sure, you may be a master inventor. And you can invent anything. But if an enemy wants to stop you? Guess what! He starts a fight. And whether or not you win the fight determines if you invent the thing or not.<br/><br/>And the fights should be the focus of the game, I think, so it works (in my mind).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/the%20cat" title="the cat"><img alt="the cat" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/the%20cat">the cat</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213548/#Comment_213548" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-19T21:20:57+00:00" title="June 19, 2009  9:20PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe your right...
