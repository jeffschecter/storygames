To that end, they also seem a bit more mainstream. Not that there's anything explicitly wrong with that, but I'm already working on two "traditional" RPGs. I want to do something a little deeper, TBH.<br/><br/>So I'm asking the creative minds here to help me bash this thing out in my head. I'm going to watch Quadrophenia tonight to see if I can get some more inspiration there. Anyone have some good ideas on things to read/watch that might get my creative juices flowing? How about games that deal with social conflict more than heroic endeavors (I've downloaded the original, free "Carry" and will be reading it later)?<br/><br/>Help me out here.

It was definitely a time of social revolution. The time I think would be most interesting is '64 to '67. That's literally the crescendo of that particular scene (granted, it's been revived more times than a narcoleptic swimmer). Somewhere in me, I think this should be an important theme of the game: "radical change."<br/><br/>That time-frame was when the scene really did blow up, but was about to die... because of selling out, media saturation, and *huge* social upheaval. What was it like for the kids of that time? Could they see these big changes in England and in the world coming on the horizon? How did that play out in their personal lives?<br/><br/>That stuff really interests me. When I get in to history, this is the type of thing that captures me. What was it like for the people who were living it?<br/><br/>Thing is... I'm not sure there's a game there. I *fell* like there is *somewhere*, but I just can't tag it, yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vertigo25" title="vertigo25"><img alt="vertigo25" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://vertigo25.com/junk/supesavatar-tiny.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vertigo25">vertigo25</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139024/#Comment_139024" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-10T10:17:24+00:00" title="April 10, 2008 10:17AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh... and I think northerain's idea absolutely *has* to go in... except no chain saws (I think only *really* big ones existed back then), and maybe it would be Mods vs. Rockers. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139031/#Comment_139031" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-10T10:32:10+00:00" title="April 10, 2008 10:32AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For social upheaval you need competing ideas.

Each player controls a certain aspect of the character's psychological make-up. They all contend for a certain amount of control by manipulating his various desires, emotions, etc. They'll do this by introducing different story elements, like having a pretty bird walk by while he's trying to practice with his band, or what have you.<br/><br/>I was watching the YouTube video of the Grey Ranks actual play, and I really like how the players introduced who they had played. In my game, that scene would play out more along the lines of, "Hi, my name's Andy, and I'll be playing Jimmy's feelings of abandonment."<br/><br/>How I'll do this, mechanically, remains to be seen. The ideas I've had so far are too competitive. I mean... I want for there to be an element of competition, but not towards an end that feels like one player has "won." In the end, if they all tell a great story, they should all feel rewarded.<br/><br/>Jarrod: I've downloaded the Misspent Youth rules outline and am going to try to read it at some point <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> It does, indeed, seem like good inspiration material.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
