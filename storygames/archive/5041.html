There are still skills, but the lack of stunts makes things more fluid.

That would be the potential downside, as well; removing one layer of crunch puts extra strain on the other mechanics to carry the game's mood.

With skills not so much, as the skills seem easy enough to work with (for me that is) but with stunts yeah.  <br/><br/>In a recent game based on Crimson Skies, we limited ourselves to 5 stunts, which I think helped a bit (we didn't think about optimization as much to get the kewlness, we rather just spread them around a lot more).<br/><br/>Do it, and post the results!<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_113642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113642/#Comment_113642" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-11T14:03:20+00:00" title="December 11, 2007  2:03PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            While I third the "try it an tell us!" sentiment, I think it's worth experimenting.

I could take or leave 'em.<br/><br/>I happen to like Skills, if only because they allow people to shine in different ways, but when I'm running a quick demo I only care about the top three skills and I discard the extra effects of skills (like number of languages due to Athletics, extra stress boxes due to Endurance &amp; Resolve, etc.)  But, there's nothing to say that going all the way to just Aspects wouldn't also produce that same effect -- nothing, except to try it out, that is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113645/#Comment_113645" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-11T14:15:18+00:00" title="December 11, 2007  2:15PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've run it that way and it works great.

(You can download them from the FATE list.)  They don't have Stunts, and the skills are very very simplified and streamlined- I feel that the game works better without stunts because character creation is so much faster; it excells more as a one shot.<br/><br/>The dilemma I think you'll find without skills is properly statting encounters- what is your base quality, and what difficutly is it fair to roll against?  The aspect/fate chip economy will be way up front and center.  Again, Fate 2 worked a lot more similarly to this, but losing that level may make it so you have to deflate your difficutly levels.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_113897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zoatebix" title="zoatebix"><img alt="zoatebix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zoatebix">zoatebix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113897/#Comment_113897" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-12T16:38:16+00:00" title="December 12, 2007  4:38PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you take out skills and stunts, why not take out the dice mechanics that go with them?<br/><br/>It would take some work, and probably ample inspiration from <i>...In Spaaace</i>, <i>Amber </i>, and other games, but one might be able to tweak the Fate Point economy in such a way to make it a whole game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113904/#Comment_113904" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-12T16:54:32+00:00" title="December 12, 2007  4:54PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just a blind "bid" of fate points?

I'm gonna go on a tangent here, since this sort of RPG (focused on the narrative elements, and minimizing the game-ness) is what i've been working on the most for the better part of a decade now. Now, i'm not saying that what you're suggesting (or what a lot of other RPGs use) is bad, by any means. Just that it's not the only way to do it.<br/><br/>You do not <b>need</b> to have mechanical quantification or balancing mechanisms in an RPG. Most of the games out there that have free-form trait creation nonetheless equalize characters in some way mechanically. The most common techniques i've seen are (in no particular order):\n<ol><li>same number of traits<br/></li><li>limiting mechanism to the use of traits (using a trait costs a token, and everyone has the same number of tokens)<br/></li><li>same "values" of traits (everyone has one Superb, one Good, and one Fair trait, or just all traits have the same value)<br/></li><li>same total "value" of traits (everyone has 10 points to spend on traits; you can have a 5-pt trait or 5 1-pt traits, or whatever)<br/></li><li>trait descriptions are mechanically meaningless; all traits are equally-valuable/effective in play, and success/failure is primarily determined by some other mechanic<br/></li></ol>\nSotC deals with aspects using options 1, 2, and 3, basically: everyone has the same number, all traits are essentially of equal value, and they have, in theory, equal access to the fate points needed to use them. OtE is an excellent example of combining 1 and 3: you can have traits like "showy bartender" and "jedi" in the same group, and the game "balances" these by giving you the same dice to work with. So, while "jedi" might come into play more often, you still only get 4d to roll when it does--if trying to juggle liquor bottles, the two characters are on an equal footing.<br/><br/>And that, right there, shows up the failings in any such system, IME: if you allow truly open-ended freeform trait creation, it doesn't matter how tightly you control the use of those traits. Any attempt at mechanical balance (whether trying to balance character effectiveness or player spotlight time) goes out the window. Instead, you're forced to fall back on using narrative techniques to make sure that everyone gets their share of spotlight time--making sure you set up situations where everyone has something to contribute, and avoiding situations where one person outshines everyone else consistently, among other things. So, why not just cut all the mechanical balancing bits out in the first place? <br/><br/>Personally, i'm a big fan of freeform traits coupled with mechanical limits--OtE, SotC, and many others. But i was talkin to a friend a while ago, and he's been playing a lot of games that work in that way, and he's the one who first verbalized the point i'm making here. He was realizing that the mechanical constraints exposed the artificiality of the freeform definitions: while in theory you could define your character any way you want, in practice your definitions end up having their scope/effectiveness constrained by the mechanical side of things. Those mechanisms are awesome at promoting equal spotlight time, but get in the way of differentiating characters based on power (if they don't have unique niches). That is, if everyone has, say, 5 tokens to spend to activate traits, and one character has "took a fencing lesson. once." and "stable hand" as traits, and the other has "best swordsman in the Muskateers" and "taught Hidalgo's everything he knows", and they both try to race a horse across the desert and fight a dozen swordsmen, either they'll be equally effective, or the tokens are no longer regulating effectiveness, and the person with broader/greater traits is more powerful. Neither of these is a bad situation, it's just that neither of them is an example of combining truly freeform trait creation with balanced characters--they're either not balanced, or the freeform-ness is an illusion, with only quality, not quantity, being under the player's control.<br/><br/>[Now, neither Dread nor Four Colors al Fresco go completely freeform--both regulate the number of traits a character has, and constrain their nature in some way. But they do so not for situation resolution reasons, but purely for character creation reasons. There's nothing in either system that would stop you from creating either Batman or Superman (to use the classic superhero example) from the same starting point. Both rely on the players, rather than the rules, to limit character power and preserve schtick uniqueness.]<br/><br/>The end result, however, is even less a game than most RPGs. If you <b>like</b> the resource-management aspects of RPGs, or want some more structure to build your situations around (like Willow mentions), then this is definitely not for you. If, however, you're of the "rules are a necessary evil" school of thought, WRT RPGs, then let me suggest you can just chuck the skills and stunts, and not add anything in to replace them. Just go with the aspects, and nothing else. Sounds awesome to me, and i assure you, it can work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
