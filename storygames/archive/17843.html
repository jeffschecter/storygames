Well, there's one thing: resolving one bond at a time feels more natural to me than resetting Hx from +4 all the way around to +1.<br/><br/>Here's the experience rules:<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Firstly, everyone marks experience every time they roll the worst result on the dice. That means a 6- on any roll except harm rolls and other custom moves the MC cooks up.<br/><br/>Secondly, at the end of each session, ask yourselves as a group the following three questions:<br/>\u2013 Did we learn something new and important about the world?<br/>\u2013 Did we resolve a threat to the community?<br/>\u2013 Did we create something new in this world?<br/>For every question answered with "yes", everyone marks experience.<br/><br/>Thirdly, everyone has two highlighted stats, just like normal. However, don't mark experience when you roll for them. Instead, after the session ask the group:<br/>\u2013 Did I show how cool I can be?<br/>\u2013 Did I show how hard I can be?<br/>\u2013 Did I show how hot I can be?<br/>\u2013 Did I show how sharp I can be?<br/>\u2013 Did I show how weird I can be?<br/>That is, ask the two questions corresponding to your highlighted stats. For each question the group answers with a "yes", you mark experience.<br/><br/>Fourthly, you mark experience from resetting Hx and being manipulated and following the advice of someone who's oftener right and stuff like that just as you always did.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E_4lHB6STp19Vu2YAiYqvxyobDF9qOLD_9wKqSs8rI8/edit#heading=h.1qns2n3f1rg0" rel="nofollow">Here's the bonds rules</a>, including starting bonds for all the standard and LE playbooks I have.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Notes on the xp system:<br/><br/>For marking xp on the worst result, I guess the MC could judge a custom move they made to not have any result worse than the other, and then you'd get no xp regardless. It'd be a pretty boring move though.<br/><br/>For the questions, I recommend you pick three questions appropriate for your campaign. Here are the ones I can come up with, feel free to add your own.<br/>\u2013 Did we learn something new and important about the post-apocalyptic world?<br/>\u2013 Did we learn something new and important about the apocalypse?<br/>\u2013 Did we meet a notable new NPC?<br/>\u2013 Did we resolve a threat to the community?<br/>\u2013 Did we create something new in this world?<br/>\u2013 Did we make a notable change in any power balance?<br/>\u2013 Did we bask in the decadence, filth, or misery of the apocalypse world?<br/>\u2013 Did we overcome a notable adversary?<br/>Dungeon World also has "Did we loot a memorable treasure?" but that feels a bit off here.<br/><br/>Of course you can combine these options, since the experience option doesn't change how Hx works but rather assumes that now and then some xp rolls in from your Hx. This fact is still true when you play with the bonds option; it probably happens a bit more often.<br/><br/>In total, I suspect the xp system will give you more xp than standard AW. You could:<br/>\u2013 drop the highlight and campaign-appropriate questions at the end, only marking for missed rolls<br/>\u2013 drop the marking for missed rolls, only using the questions<br/>\u2013 increase the number of xp required to take an advance; I'd suggest 8 plus one for each advance you've taken, so the first costs 8, then 9, 10 and so on. Or a flat rate of 8.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/><br/>If anyone tries it out, let me know! We might be trying the xp rules in two weeks.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403836/#Comment_403836" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-16T17:21:42+00:00" title="January 16, 2013  5:21PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting.
