But then we started talking about the assumptions behind the game.</p>\n<p>I'm not entirely keen on discussing the creative process in such detail that it kills the poor frog, but this part's important to the discussion: TSOY is intentionally, in every way, a game about a world in which the only thing that matters is human action, and human action is empowered to change the course of history. Any and every human in the game has the capability to change the world, and there is nothing that can override that. Storn asked if it wouldn't be too hard to add gods and true monsters, and it's a good question, but the answer is definitely no. Even if you found a way to make it mechanically work - which I think might be hard - it's not TSOY by my reckoning.</p>\n<p>But I want to back up. My original statement was if you aren't playing in the setting that comes with a game, you are not playing that game. That's a seriously <em>auteur</em> stance to take, and I'm not sure I can back it up, but it's an appealing position to me and I want to see if it's right. Before someone attacks the idea on the front that it's elitist and puts the power of creation into the hands of some rarefied game designer, know that my end goal for the RPG publishing hobby is for each group to make their own game for each story they play out, which this idea plays into.</p>\n<p>So let's look at some real cases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>I ran a game of HeroQuest set in Glorantha recently, but simplified the setting, merging some gods and people that were similar, in order to make it manageable for my group.</p></li>\n<li><p>I am playing D&amp;D, but have made up my own setting, which fits into an empty part of the canon setting. It is made for me to do this, and I'm not making up new monsters or races or anything: I'm just describing a cold place.</p></li>\n<li><p>I played in a game of TSOY with the Durham 3 set in a fantasy-punk Japan. We used only the rules from the book, and made species metaphorical: the street gangs were "ratkin" and had ratkin powers, and as a Buddhist monk, I had elf powers.</p></li>\n<li><p>I wrote and have played much of The Princes' Kingdom, which uses the basic rules of Dogs in the Vineyard in a totally different setting with different morality and different purposes of play.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ok, so maybe some of these aren't playing the original game. I bet many of you would think that The Princes' Kingdom ain't Dogs, and I'd agree, although I'd say that's an easy conclusion to come to, since it's in a book. What if it wasn't? How about that game of TSOY? I count it as not-TSOY, but instead "Remi's unnamed game a lot like TSOY."</p>\n<p>This seems like a semantic issue - and that phrase is a great phrase to pshaw an idea you don't care to think of, so back off, haters - but it's an important one to me as a creative person. I love every person who talks about TSOY online, but man, every time I hear about "TSOY in this world where...",  I think, is it TSOY? When I hear about My Life With Master, but at the North Pole, I think, is it My Life with Master? I don't think it is, but I also think that I may be slicing this bread a bit too thin, so I'm looking for your feedback.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce" title="Dave Younce"><img alt="Dave Younce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g232/thomastamblyn/Avatars/GoPlayDice.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce">Dave Younce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103548/#Comment_103548" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-17T20:37:11+00:00" title="October 17, 2007  8:37PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think often it's just shorthand - "Aztec TSOY" tells me to expect an Aztec setting and very TSOY-like mechanics.  I guess my question is, how would you have such things referred to? Remi's unnamed game a lot like TSOY should get its own name?  Because it may not be TSOY, but it's not really "Not-TSOY" very much at all, right?<br/><br/>What about games with multiple canonical settings? If you're playing D&amp;D with the default setting and cosmology, you're really playing Greyhawk? Or playing Forgotten Realms?  That doesn't really seem like two different games to me.

I'll try anyway.  <br/><br/>Obviously, I think that while we've played TSOY with so many non-Near settings, we're still staying true to the basic concepts of the game.*  Each of our games has focused on essential human interactions, and their power to change everything.  We just finished a long running game where my character transcended with Endure, sacrificing himself to save countless others.  Despite the fact that my guy was from Kentucky instead of Khale, we're still using the same abilities and keys, making the same hard choices and dear sacrifices.  <br/><br/>So, yeah, I think we're still playing the same game, just like I think that Graham's <em>Darker</em> is still the <em>Roach</em>.  I think it departs from being the same game when it becomes both mechanically and conceptually a different game, so maybe that includes <em>The Princes Kingdom</em>.  I think you'd be the best judge of that.<br/><br/>*<small>okay, well, in this latest one we went off the wall a bit with super-powered humans, but still...</small> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103550/#Comment_103550" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-17T20:56:36+00:00" title="October 17, 2007  8:56PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My standard reply:<br/><br/>Nobody plays the game you designed, ever.

That sucks. What happened?"<br/>A: "Well, it was boring. Every single combat the GM declared we had to do something called "Bring Down the Pain", which made them all long and drawn out. Then at one point I wanted to find out what happened to my brother, but because I had "Key of Love" with the NPC Princess (the GM wrote it on my sheet), I HAD to instead go and save the princess in the dungeon. We went through a dungeon filled with traps, and slayed 10 rust monsters. We were about to die, but luckily we found potions which replenished all of our Pool scores."<br/>B: "... what the fuck is THAT?"<br/><br/>Then yeah, one has a case for saying "You did not play the game" (JD's argument to the side for a moment). It would be like opening a box of Monopoly and then playing Twister on it.<br/><br/>I remember, though can not find, a post that reads exactly like the above, where someone played Inspectres at a Con. It turns out that the GM didn't like ANY of the fun rules (like the spotlight chair), didn't use the "Gym/Liibrary cards", player input was shot down by the GM, etc, and basically ran the game exactly as if it was the Ghostbusters RPG, but with the words "Inspectres" on the cover.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Storn" title="Storn"><img alt="Storn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Storn">Storn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103610/#Comment_103610" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-18T07:08:36+00:00" title="October 18, 2007  7:08AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Clinton sez:  <i>Any and every human in the game has the capability to change the world, and there is nothing that can override that.

Even if you found a way to make it mechanically work - which I think might be hard - it's not TSOY by my reckoning.</i><br/><br/>Clinton, I *think* we might have a differing opinion on what can go into a Monster or a God.  Certainly I can see Dracula being swayed by words... he is the Lord of the Vampires and if Gray Mouser sways him over dinner not to eat Mouser and Fafhrd in a game of TSOY... I think that is pretty damn cool.  And Dracula is a monster.  Maybe not a d&amp;d troped out monster, but a monster.  A monster that predates d&amp;D mentality by quite some time.  Same with Frankenstein.  Or Godzilla...who seems to get swayed only by cute children and engenues... but nevertheless, it happens occasionally.<br/><br/>And pantheons like Greek or Norse are pretty damn "human".  Escalating, and kicking Thor in the balls might get a hearty laugh of approval, a clap on the back, for your own brass ones.  Humans swaying gods seem to be what those stories are all about.  And vice versa.<br/><br/>I think Dracula and Frankenstein and Greek Gods are very much about Humans.  And I think "humanization" of d&amp;d Bugbears, Xorns and Gods in a Forgotten Realms or a Greyhawk will certainly shake things up... and could be pretty cool.  Those settings are really going to be seriously impacted by the TSOY rules.  Shifting and formating to the TSOY rules... then... doesn't it become TSOY?  Are we not exploring what you set out for us to explore, just not in Near?<br/><br/>However, these are minor devil advocacies to your main point.  Which is Only Setting Provided with System is the One True Game that can be Called TSOY.  Which is truly interesting.<br/><br/>Yet, I find it amusing that in your own words, with the Durham Three, you describe a game of TSOY using a fantasy-punk Japan.  <br/><br/>I think this is very much about Perception.  I read TSOY and fell in love with the system.  I read Near and went; "hmmm...interesting... but doesn't grab me."  I went about my gaming discourses as thinking of TSOY as that system that I fell in love with.  And at some point, it just gets too lengthy to say "<i>I play a fantasy punk Japan that uses the TSOY system with some shiny new bits added on."  </i>  It is simply easier to say: <i> "TSOY fantasy punk Japan".<br/></i>  And move along in the conversation.<br/><br/>I ran into this conundrum too.  I ran a Spirit of the Century "engine" for a Eberron setting, set specifically in Sharn (Eberron's NYC).  The parallels between SOTC character generation hinging on The Great War and Eberron's own recent Great War were pretty succinct.  Often I would call it Spirit of Sharn, but equally call it Eberron using SOTC.  Okay, we didn't have cars and planes and gats aka the 1920 setting of SOTC.  But we did have the tongue in cheek, the pulp pacing, the detective noir smooshed together with all that d20 oddness of Eberron.  In the end, I was *using* Spirit of the Century as the game.  IN a different setting.  That's all.<br/><br/>So, I'm not convinced that TSOY has to be played in Near to be considered TSOY.  Seems... constraining and perhaps closing off to some really cool possiblities.... in the original thread, someone put down you can't do 3 adventuring negotiators with Bugbears and Xorns.  My gut and immediate reaction was "<i>why the hell not?  That sounds like an awesome game.  And if TSOY is the engine to do it, then bring it!  bah-bee!!!!"<br/></i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103668">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103668/#Comment_103668" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-18T09:35:43+00:00" title="October 18, 2007  9:35AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Clinton R. Nixon</cite>Making coffee this morning, I got my own point: somewhere along the way, System Does Matter became Only System Does Matter, for a lot of people. Like I said, I think tweaking games is a good thing, and is what should happen, but I also think that the setting of games matters as much as the system, and is, in many cases, part of the system. The setting can reflect the game's values and intentions, and when you change that setting, you can easily change those values and intentions.</blockquote>\nI definitely agree that setting is part of system (if not, then the setting is irrelevant to the game). The players are also part of system, which Jason Corely gets at in the following statement:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Nobody plays the game you designed, ever. Not even once. The second everyone sits down to play and someone opens their mouth? Everything you wanted to do with your game is over and destroyed and gone forever.<br/><br/>I know this is a conversation stopper, and it reduces discourse to near-absurdity, but it is, unfortunately, correct.<br/></blockquote>\nAnd taking this to an even greater level of absurdity, it's almost impossible to ever play the same game twice.<br/><br/>But Andy raises a valid point, picking up a D&amp;D book and pasting the TSOY cover on it doesn't make the game you are playing TSOY. So the question is where do we draw the line? One measure I would use is would the author of the game text recognize your game as fundamentally the game published if he observed your game but couldn't see the rules text you were referencing? Would someone familiar with the game who wanted to join your game be able to just drop in, or will they need to read a 20 page set of house rules, listen to you lecture for an hour on the house rules that haven't made it into the document yet, and still, during play, discover that there's yet twenty more house rules that perhaps aren't even acknowledged?<br/><br/>Does TSOY set in fantasy punk Japan convey enough information? Probably not. As a shortcut to talk about this awesome game it may be useful. As a shortcut to allow people to connect your stories about the game and start to build their own idea about your game, definitely useful.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103681/#Comment_103681" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-18T10:21:59+00:00" title="October 18, 2007 10:21AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that, while you're technically right JD, the conversation really doesn't stop there. Just because you don't play 100% the game as written doesn't mean the game as written doesn't have a substantial impact on play. The same group playing according to the rules of D&amp;D will have a different experience than the same group playing according to the rules of TSOY; this is not impacted by the fact that Group A playing TSOY will have a different experience than Group B playing TSOY. There are similarities between the difference among Group A's D&amp;D and TSOY games that mirror the difference among Group B's D&amp;D and TSOY games, and those are what we talk about when we discuss specific games.<br/><br/>So when I say, "we're playing Game X," I'm not saying that our play experience and/or our whole System is exactly the same as anyone else who plays Game X.  I'm saying that Game X has an impact on our System, and that's what we're looking at. Dismissing the discussion about games just because that impact is not 100% determinative of our play experience is unproductive.<br/><br/>The questions then are: to what degree, and how, does Game X impact our System? Does it reliably do that for other groups? Is this impact largely kept intact if we change the setting or tweak the rules in certain ways?<br/><br/>And it seems to me that those are the questions we're addressing in this thread, and they're very valuable at that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103725/#Comment_103725" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-18T13:14:42+00:00" title="October 18, 2007  1:14PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree that "impact on play" is what you're after, but group choice even subsumes that as well.  For 3-4 of my 6-person play group, who never organize games, never GM games, and dislike providing input onto games outside their character, virtually nothing printed in any game book has any direct impact on them.  Any impact on them is mediated through another player at the table whose ideas are the ones actually affecting play. <br/><br/>I suspect there are probably players like this in every group - or if there's not, play like their play at moments in every game.<br/><br/>Anyway, as I say, go about your business. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
