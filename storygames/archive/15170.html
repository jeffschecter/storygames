Or is all this experience just the time you need to shake off bad game habits and re-access what should come naturally? Is it ok to use crutches? Should games allow for different mixes of structure and freeform to allow us to manage our comfort zone better?<br/><br/>These are some of my excerpts that might help to make sense of it all:<br/><br/><i>The lack of rules to handle it made me panic, whereas Johnstone and Daniel (Emperor) just negotiated up to a compromise.. they kind of played it as jazz, and it worked for them.

I hope it's applicable here.<br/><br/>Which parts of freeform are natural?  I think it depends on your background as a storyteller, actor, author, party-goer, diplomat, manager, debater, and more.  The same stuff that affects any game or creative or social activity comes into play; the only difference with freeform is, if that stuff doesn't line up right, there's no game.<br/><br/>Games with structure give us concrete things to do, so even if it's not easy or natural or fun, we can in fact proceed.  So then maybe it becomes fun.  Or maybe we derive satisfaction purely from system interaction.  There are a lot of options, a lot of outs!<br/><br/>Freeform has no outs.  You either make it work or it utterly dies.  Learning to make it work can give you some mad skills, though!  And once you have those skills, it may become your preferred way to play.<br/><br/>If you come to roleplaying to act and talk and imagine and subsume into virtual experience, then being able to do that without dice or cards or character sheets is kind of sweet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_344797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344797/#Comment_344797" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-04T00:02:23+00:00" title="October  4, 2011 12:02AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 4, 2011 12:05AM by TomasHVM.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Freeform" is an oxymoron, if ever I saw one. :-)<br/><br/>Important:<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ivan</cite>The lack of rules to handle it made me panic, whereas Johnstone and Daniel (Emperor) just negotiated up to a compromise..</blockquote><i>Negotiating</i> is key; setting down <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the form</span>, where no form is. There is no game that works well with players being fully free, so you have to negotiate what kind of form to have. It may be a one sided negotiation (I, the GM, decide) or it may be consensus driven (we, the players, decide), but you have to reach a mutual understanding of how to play within a very short time from opening the game. And you need to be prepared for re-negotiating, in case of challenges to the agreed form. The basis for this (constant) negotiation is the mindset of players; try to facilitate an open and positive mindset, ensuring that everyone will participate in negotiations with serious expediency; <i>We want to reach a quick and simple agreement, so play may continue!</i><br/><br/>When J and D manages this negotiation, it's due to them being more experienced, and thus feeling more comfortable in the interactive-creative context. And they know something about what makes a game work, so they are able to negotiate fast, so that the game don't die on them.<br/><br/>As long as you know what to do (negotiate), and have some inkling what methodic tools (simple ones) will support a gang of grown ups playing, you should be able to fix this with some ease too.<br/><br/>One important thing to remember, is that we call it "freeform" due to <i>our lust for unfettered role-playing</i>. So you need to start with no rules, and then negotiate simple and light rules, to have the players keep a feeling that their game-play is <i>full and flowing freeform</i> (form made up on the spot, with ease). <br/><br/>In my view "freeform" is mostly about how you perceive the game. To keep the positive flow such a game often starts up with (but sadly; often loose within the first debacle of rules-negotiation), the players need to keep the perception of it as something light, nimble and unfettered. As long as you do, it will stay that way, even when delving into deeper themes (which such games, sadly, seldom do).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ivan</cite>until you get the level of flow to go fully freeform..</blockquote>Keep an open mindset, know your negotiation, and how far you can go with rules (light, simple), and the game is yours. The flow is something that comes by itself, so don't worry about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344799/#Comment_344799" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-04T00:16:35+00:00" title="October  4, 2011 12:16AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            People who have never roleplayed formally often do freeform.

"Freeform" might be easy in one sense--just say anything--but fulfilling a game's premise (or a group's), and creating a satisfying story through it, or a dramatic arc?

Other times I could sustain a long dialogue between two characters I was controlling. Sometimes it was a matter of skill, other times it was a matter of confidence.  <br/><br/>There is some Comfort Zone that depends on many factors including skill, being eased into it by the game procedures, experience, feeling safe, knowing improv techniques, being a bit high and guts.<br/><br/>The issue of the comfort zone is rarely addressed in how games are presented and it seems to be assumed that you can just follow the rules and it will work, and if it doesn't work then the game is broken.. as David said<br/><br/><b>Freeform has no outs. You either make it work or it utterly dies.</b><br/><br/>but this also applies to a GM not knowing what to do next in a game of D&amp;D, or people getting stuck in negotiating a future scenario playing Shock. <br/><br/>Other times we have so much internalized process that we can make even broken games work (which is what the 'system doesnt matter' faction claimed).<br/><br/>If there is no space for freeform, then we have a boardgame.. if we allow space for freeform, we accept a chance of falling flat (could this also be why we like RPGs?).<br/><br/>I don't know what point I want to make exactly, but I am interested in your opinion.<br/><br/>(..also reading Vincent's links now..)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344802/#Comment_344802" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-04T01:43:07+00:00" title="October  4, 2011  1:43AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            By the way, I can't believe I used the horrible word 'natural' in the title. <br/>It's a bad bad word used to push your opinions on others.<br/><br/>When I said 'natural' I mean 'effortless'.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_344806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344806/#Comment_344806" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-04T03:40:56+00:00" title="October  4, 2011  3:40AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ivan</cite>It sounds all very zen.. learn the form to shed it and get back to the effortless way of a child :-)<br/>Which seems to apply to so many things in life..</blockquote>Ja, a nice way of describing it. <br/><br/>And you are right; to rediscover the effortless way you need to travel beyond the dreary hills of knowledge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344807">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344807/#Comment_344807" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-04T03:50:32+00:00" title="October  4, 2011  3:50AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To be clearer, the people in my example had zero experience of roleplay as a game and whilst they didn't necessarily throw themselves into the roles they had to play, these worked pretty well without and rules or even discussion of rules.

At some point of our life we have both readed and watched other people play RPGs, both trad and freeform and learned the basic outlines of the rules/social contract applied, and so we came to understand the game. Perhaps in a few cases you just needed some basic rule and came up with the rest of the game idea yourself, and then found out there were more games like the one you created. <br/><br/>I'd say the effortless way you mean actually refers to how quickly you come to understand/invent/came up with a mindset to confront the issue in front of you. For some people its easier to create content and drive other people to create content in the same way. Some people have a harder time at this but can easily calculate tons of modifiers and bonuses multiplied by seven different rolls, and remember even the most obscure rules from forgotten suplements. So we have different tools to confront different problems.<br/><br/>For example, I haven't been able yet to play games that go more into the narrative freeform than into the strategical use of the rules. However I've done a ton of brainstorming for writing fiction with some pals, even talking in character and all and having fun at it, though for some reason we didin't considered it roleplaying but a fun way of writing. Even in this way of working, we started using a couple of tricks from the Cave of Plato that help a lot to keep the fiction on trails. <br/><br/>Now, is learning to play hard won with experience? I'd say it depends on the way you like to play. Perhaps you can just relax and let the fiction flow, or like me you need at least a little bit of control, or perhaps you can't relax if you don't go like a total control freak on it. Either way has it's ups and downs and the only way it can become harder is if you try to play using a different mindset that the one you're used to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344828/#Comment_344828" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-04T10:39:46+00:00" title="October  4, 2011 10:39AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 4, 2011 10:44AM by David_Berg.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I agree that "freeform" is an oxymoron; you are just moving the prompts around.</blockquote>Well, if we look at the entirety of the activity I'd have to agree.  But for me, "freeform" has a strong association with leaving all formal prompts out of it for long stretches of time.  Just looking at your friends to see how they're responding to your roleplay doesn't strike me as much "form" at all.  We probably had some hard procedures or ritual phrases or keywords or mechanics or pretty pictures to kick us off, and we'll probably need those again later on when we get tired or distracted and lose the flow.  But for a while*, nope, none of that.<br/><br/>*In my last long term group, good freeform flow -- thrilling play through just talking -- seemed to tend to last about 1-1.5 hrs.  Every once in a while it was more like 3 hours.<br/><br/>Edit: Oh, right, duh, I'm missing the obvious "form" of the player roles.  This was a game with one GM and 3 players just playing their characters.  So yes, form aplenty!  But no formal prompts.  E.g., "Now what do you do?" wasn't code for anything and didn't need to be said in a specific construction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344829/#Comment_344829" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-04T10:43:57+00:00" title="October  4, 2011 10:43AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>Just looking at your friends to see how they're responding to your roleplay</blockquote>\nThat's a social prompt.

But doing the same thing with Jim is painful and awkward. However, with Jim you can create complex worlds from scratch is easy. And Julia knows just how to offer you a challenge in the form of a puzzle. Etc.<br/><br/>I think "doing freeform" isn't so much a thing. "Playing the way we do in our group when we decide to do THIS," that's a thing.<br/><br/>That's not to say, of course, that you can't develop your skills in any of these situations. Improv "rules" and principles are really useful ideas in this sense. The other skills, it seems to me, are not all that different from regular old social skills and paying close attention to those around you. So, I suppose "listening" would be the primary skill here.<br/><br/>Vincent's thoughts on the limitations of freeform are very, very interesting, however!

Children do it without any instruction at all (in most, if not all, social animal species). We don't need to learn shit to freeform because freeform is about learning. We learn not to do it as we grow up.  You can get back to it pretty easily, though you may need some practice and a safe space to do it (such as a time set side with others interested in doing it as well).<br/><br/>There is a therapeutic practice called Developmental Transformation (DVT) that has a sole goal of forming a "play space" that allows a place for the freeform play we did naturally as children. The idea is that this teaches us more about who we are (and helps us explore personal issues in a much more accessible way) and it's very challenging to get comfortable with outside of childhood.<br/><br/>But we don't really mean that when <b>we</b> talk about freeform.<br/><br/>I think the truth is few of us what that learning, challenging, unfettered play. We want improv and acting techniques to help ensure that it's "good" play. We want prompts and dice rolls to give us permission to go in new directions. We want rules to set boundaries on what is and isn't acceptable.  We want all these things because we want to get something out of it. Maybe fun. Maybe compelling stories. Maybe a strong theme.  Freeform as typically discussed for a roleplaying style very much fits into here. And restrictions are something that has to be learned. It's all through experience.  <br/><br/>But that experience can simply be words on a page.  You don't need to go through 10 years of roleplaying to "hard win" that experience. Someone can just tell you the boundaries and give you room to play. You may hit those boundaries wrong sometimes when starting out, and it hurts, but it's not mountain climbing. It's natural and part of the process. But the truth is those restrictions are what's unnatural. We need to learn those. And that's what takes some playing around with. Whether those rules are freeform play or hard-core HERO games super heroes, they're not natural, they're tools we've made.

Childrens play is ful of them donning adult characters, and trying out how life really is. They are wired to do it, but still they need to learn it too. There are lots of children these days (at least here in Norway) who have no skill in role-playing, and that leaves them seriously handicapped when it comes to learning social behavior.<br/><br/>But most of us have learned it, so it comes "naturally" to us.

Here's the summary:<br/><br/>1. Play <i>Silver &amp; White</i> and see if it has enough instructions and guidance for you. I don't think it's trying to be "GMless" or "freeform" as much as it wants to be something else; something that makes it seem obvious and natural to play games this way.<br/><br/>2. Games like <i>Polaris</i> and <i>Fiasco</i> and current versions of <i>Geiger Counter</i> still show signs of the GM having been removed.  This is also true of some freeform games where certain mechanics have been obviously removed, such that you can still see where they might have been.  In my opinion, this is less ideal than moving towards a different model, where you never even consider a GM or mechanics.  Even <i>Silver &amp; White</i>'s descriptive roles are kinda GM-like and the touching takes the place where you would normally expect mechanical resolution, so it falls into this category at present, but I think it hints at something more.<br/><br/>3. It's really hard to talk about GMless or freeform games in the abstract, because they're even more different (in my experience) than different games that both have GMs.  The ways you can portion out responsibility and share creative control are endless.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_344943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344943/#Comment_344943" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-05T15:16:52+00:00" title="October  5, 2011  3:16PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 5, 2011 3:24PM by TomasHVM.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

Lots of different ways to do it. Lots of different definitions. Which are your question about? Seems like the first set of 6.<br/><br/>Natural? Sure, but not in every case, not to everyone. <br/><br/>Easier than mechanics based play? Yes. Absolutely. But questions the assumptions of what we (generally) consider role playing games. For some crazy reason. Really, these are just great tools to find new ways to dive into fictional play with friends. <br/><br/>Harder? Looking at fully freeform, co-gm'ng with improvised system. Challenging because you have to define your own territory and negotiate and work things out with the other players in fully-committed, full contact with the game world kind of way. Using well-defined structures even things like the Sea of Doubt on through Fiasco and jeep, are much, much easier. If what you are talking about is letting go of stats, pass/fail mechanics, gm structure or any of the many other trappings of standard hobby play, having new, well thought out and tried procedures is very helpful. <br/><br/>For me, the fully free-formed, no formal structured play--except what we find works for us as we go along--has been peak play.

But then every time someone said "I survey the area", it felt canned and kind of interfered with the "we're really there" flow.  So now I don't want people to literally say that, but at the same time I need a way to communicate to them what to do.

Seriously, how would you go about it?</blockquote>\nHmm, I'm not sure it's easier to talk about than to actually do.  Here's an example of how you could do it, based on one game I'm working on:<br/><br/>1. When it's your turn (in the AW sense, not like turn-taking), say what your character says, does, feels, thinks, or looks like.<br/><br/>2. When it's the GM's turn, they describe what NPCs say, do, or look like, or what the environment sounds, feels, smells, tastes, or looks like.<br/><br/>3. To press your advantage against an NPC or the environment, tell the GM that you are using one of your "trumps."  The basic trumps that everyone has are:<br/>-- threats or promises<br/>-- violence<br/>-- expert knowledge<br/>-- practiced skill<br/>-- desparation<br/><br/>Each class of character also begins with an additional trump.  Wizards get "arcane power" for example.  Assassins might get "quick and deadly."<br/><br/>When you invoke a trump, the other side has to choose:<br/>-- fall victim to your prowess<br/>-- resist, at great cost to themselves<br/>-- defy all fairness, fate, and the will of the gods, escalating the situation<br/><br/>Some NPCs and environmental features (traps) have their own trumps.  For example, "poisoned tentacles" or "long drop onto sharpened sticks."<br/><br/>If a PC, NPC, or environmental feature has multiple trumps invoked against them at once, they have to choose different options. Thus, if you have three trumps invoked against you, you have to choose all three options.<br/><br/>4. When you resist at great cost or fall victim to someone or something that means you harm, you suffer the fictionally-established consequences: shame, pain, desire, death, etc.  Someone should probably write these consequences down, so they are not forgotten.  In appropriate situations, other players or the GM can invoke these "conditions" against you as if they were trumps.  So, if you have a broken leg but are trying to leap out of the way of a falling pillar, I can invoke your injury as a trump and make you pick (succomb, resist, defy).<br/><br/>5. You can recover from a given "condition" (i.e. set of fictional consequences) once A) it has been invoked against you and <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> you've met any fictional requirements for overcoming it, such as recieving medical treatment, having a curse lifted, finding new reasons not to trust someone, etc.<br/><br/>Boom, there's a freeform-y (depending on your definition) dungeon-y game, based just on advantages and choices.  It's still a bit game-like, and may not be quite as mechanic-free as Tomas is thinking, but it's something more in that direction.  You could probably make one that was more like <i>Montsegur 1244</i>, more about character relationships and even less about resolving what happens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w176" title="w176"><img alt="w176" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/649/nZVYYAKMQQQR6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w176">w176</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345413/#Comment_345413" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-10T09:05:27+00:00" title="October 10, 2011  9:05AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm of the opinion is freeform is easy and natural.

Very interesting.  I guess, for me, it's not about dice or other solid cues, it's about logic.  "If a fictional event meets X fictional criteria, you, Dave, must do A or B or C," doesn't feel freeform to me at all!  <br/><br/>I mean, maybe if A, B, and C were as simple as raising pinkie, index or ring finger, then I wouldn't feel that way.  But thinking, "Do I fall victim, resist at cost, or escalate?  Okay, escalate.  What shall I do to escalate?" feels like the opposite of the spontaneity that I associate with freeform.<br/><br/>Maybe fiction-mediating procedures <i>of any kind</i> is where the dividing line lies, not just fiction-mediating procedures <i>with physical cues</i>.<br/><br/>So an activity where you roll dice to see who's the GM could be procedural freeform <i>play</i>, but an activity where you pick attack consequences from a list is diceless <i>gaming</i>.<br/><br/>Pardon the undefined terminology.

I believe you are right; whatever the method; if there <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is</span> a method initially, it's not "free-form" (oh, that oxymoron). <br/><br/>Point of "free-form" is to let players make an unfettered exploration of what it is all about, while at the same time using their inventiveness to make the game work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345528">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345528/#Comment_345528" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-11T04:18:09+00:00" title="October 11, 2011  4:18AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David, we're approaching the point of no return here, where existing terminology breaks down because it was never intended to describe this stuff, but I certainly see your point.  The thing is, any set of freeform methods, if used over time, develop into those kinds of fictional triggers for specific actions.  Like, when I was running an online freeform group back in the early 2000s, the rule was that you couldn't narrate stuff about other people's characters without their permission.  In other words, "When you want to narrate something about another PC, ask their player first," which is a fictional trigger if I ever heard one.  There were others too.  Like, "When two players narrate incompatible things happening, the group moderator should step in and help resolve them."<br/><br/>In my mind, what the ruleset above -- and other similar kinds of "structured freeform" systems -- is doing is mostly just formalizing the informal or shared-but-not-regularly-spoken-aloud principles of freeform play and then extending them to structure play a bit more strongly than traditional freeform.  Yes, it looks and feels different than just winging it, but it also lets the group jump ahead a bit, as if you'd already been playing together for a while and reached an understanding as to how the game will be played. If you want the exploratory nature of starting a new freeform game and gradually developing a shared understanding with your fellow players, being surprised along the way, this may not give you exactly the same experience, but the methods being used here aren't alien or incompatible with freeform play as it's traditionally understood, I don't think.  In my mind, it's a natural extension. I mean, how else do you further develop freeform play techniques and systems, right? You kinda have to formalize them in order to be able to talk about them and be intentional about using certain ones and not others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_345586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345586/#Comment_345586" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-11T14:25:34+00:00" title="October 11, 2011  2:25PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 11, 2011 2:37PM by David_Berg.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agreed that formalizing has some virtues, but I think it can have some drawbacks*, depending on how the formalized version is used in play.<br/><br/>My prior point was about character of experience only.  <b>A -&gt; unconscious habit -&gt; B</b> feels different than <b>A -&gt; conscious rule invocation -&gt;B </b>, even if both are employed with the same regularity and produce the same fiction.<br/><br/>Somewhere in between a habit that you never even recognize and a rule that you have to look up or call out by name, I think there's a place where games can naturally incline you to do a specific sort of thing that nevertheless requires no rules consultation.<br/><br/>I'm continuing to speak very generally here; I don't have a specific solution in mind.  I just want there to be one, and it seems plausible to me that there is.<br/><br/>Speculation:<br/>Social procedures that lead to fiction are less jarring than pure fiction-generating procedures.  If we're freeforming and you sneak into my castle, and there's a moment where it seems like perhaps you might be spotted, and you say, "Let it Ride!", that's a direct comment from you to me about how we play.  If I'm on board, then I <i>initiate</i> the proper fiction (your earlier stealthiness persists, and you are not spotted) out of my own desire to accord with how we play, rather than having something <i>outside</i> myself tell me <i>directly</i> "Jonathan is not spotted".<br/><br/>"We're letting achievements ride, now how do you want to apply that here?" requires a different mental operation from me than "Defending against an attack comes at a cost, now how do you want to apply that here?"  They orient me toward the fiction in slightly different ways.  That difference might be important!<br/><br/>*Beyond the "we don't get to explore figuring out how to play" that you mentioned.  I'm not particularly interested in that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Is freeform 'natural' or hard won with experience? - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15170/is-freeform-natural-or-hard-won-with-experience/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Is freeform 'natural' or hard won with experience? - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15170/is-freeform-natural-or-hard-won-with-experience/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Uhm...

I like JWalton's fictional moves formalization as a set of guidelines rather than rules.<br/>I see it as a method to find out what can logically derive from the fiction.<br/><br/>Most outcomes can probably readily be agreed upon by anyone, based on the level of skill of the characters and the other parties involved. <br/><br/>When there is an impasse (is my mage stronger than yours? can my warrior hit your mage before he casts the spell?) then the conflict becomes about "how far are you willing to go to win?" Are you draining all your strength? Are you making a pact with a demon? Do you risk serious consequences? <br/><br/>When outcomes cannot be overcome, then you try to set up the environment to give you a chance.. and when you are on a level playing field you might still have to make sacrifices.<br/><br/>I partially use this for In a Wicked Age as well: suppose that you beat me using violence, even though you have no weapon and I do. You will be able to do this, but you will have to justify a fictional outcome that makes it possible, maybe even involving someone that helped you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_345598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345598/#Comment_345598" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-11T15:42:36+00:00" title="October 11, 2011  3:42PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 11, 2011 3:44PM by TomasHVM.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>Agreed that formalizing has some virtues, but I think it can have some drawbacks*</blockquote>Well ... role-playing games are actually all about formalizing how we play, so I believe there's more advantages than drawbacks to such a practice.<br/><br/><i>Free-form</i> though, is meant to be free from such formalistic elements, so the players are free to make up their own.

I find that the method is quite important, or to say it more accurately; how the players relate to the method  is of great importance; it is the basis for their ability to contribute to the interaction in meaningful ways, and their ability to immerse themselves in the whole <i>interactive system</i> (character, method and all).<br/><br/>So having a method that makes the players feel "natural" in their game-play, could be considered <i>a higher design-goal</i>. That is; a goal for any and all role-playng games, whatever theme, setting, genre or whatnot they are focused on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_345609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w176" title="w176"><img alt="w176" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/649/nZVYYAKMQQQR6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w176">w176</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345609/#Comment_345609" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-11T17:08:37+00:00" title="October 11, 2011  5:08PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 11, 2011 5:09PM by w176.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Like, maybe if we take Jonathan's rules, above, and play with them for three years... by the end it will feel completely natural and "freeform", once we've internalized that rule and unconsciously shape all the fiction to function within those parameters?<br/></blockquote>\nI heard some player of old school systems say that the internalized hit points to to the degree they stop being numbers and they really see them as awesome wounds in their heads. So I think it might be possible.<br/><br/>Yet I think there also is possible that there are some rules that never internalize. And this varies between individuals what you can accept as natural part of the fiction. Most of us have played with hit points for more then three years of our gaming history, and never gotten the sort a relationship to hit points that they feel like a natural and freeform part of the fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_345627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345627/#Comment_345627" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-11T22:42:38+00:00" title="October 11, 2011 10:42PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>So having a method that makes the players feel "natural" in their game-play, could be considered<i>a higher design-goal</i>.</blockquote>What I am saying, CorvusE is saying in different words (on newbie players in his game <i>Bhaloidam</i>) over here:<blockquote><cite>Posted By: CorvusE</cite> And since they are given complete control over the outcomes of their performances, they are able to <i>feel agency</i> even when sharing in a more guided story experience.</blockquote>This sounds like a great way to be a newbie player; being able to play for full, or to exhibit mastery in a narrative form of art, from session one.
