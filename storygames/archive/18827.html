I've read and re-read the dang thing too many times to be able to tell if I'm getting anywhere or if I'm making it worse.<br/><br/>If you would, please read my little blurb and tell me what you think.  If you read this on the back of an RPG book, would you open it up to read more or would you put it back on the shelf?\n<blockquote><i>In a the last megacity of Mahajiite you are part of an elite cybernetic paramilitary police force.

That's a fifteen-syllable descriptor. I almost stopped reading at that line.<br/><br/>This ad copy makes me think "well, this sounds like fascist cop worship." If that's being presented unironically and uncritically, I am going to put the book down as quickly as possible. If that's being presented ironically or critically, I will start flipping through and reading it. At this point, I don't know which it is. ... So I'm going to look for my next clue and make an assumption based on that. I'll check the graphic design of the back cover. If that doesn't give me my answer, I'll check the front cover illustration + tagline. If that doesn't give me my answer, I'll check a single random interior spread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg" title="semajmaharg"><img alt="semajmaharg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/482/n0TRVVHW3SOVY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg">semajmaharg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421739/#Comment_421739" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-21T16:57:39+00:00" title="September 21, 2013  4:57PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with <a href="/forums/profile/mcdaldno">@mcdaldno</a>.

The juxtaposition between something like that and the text is what would draw me to look at the book further.  But then, that's probably an entirely different game than what Eric is proposing.  If I were looking to play something like his or Adam's pitch as written, I'd probably want the cops to be presented as underdogs still in the midst of their revolt.  Something to make it seem like it isn't just a clean-up operation, but a fight to make sure the revolt doesn't turn.  Something that implies slavery to abberations is still an ongoing thing in the megacity where the abberations still exist, or else that the abberations outside the city are boiling up over the walls unbeknownst to the citizens within.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422233/#Comment_422233" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-01T04:03:13+00:00" title="October  1, 2013  4:03AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread is for critiquing my pitch, discussing the art of the game pitch, or (most tangentially) about samples of good pitches and bad pitches.  <br/><br/>This thread is not about the game I'm writing, cover art, or what the game may or may not be about.<br/><br/>Please keep the thread focused.
