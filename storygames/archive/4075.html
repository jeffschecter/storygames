I guess it's related to Tony's recent thread? But different.<br/><br/>There are games that rock out. Games that rock out are awesome! This is like those games where you totally head-butt a fucking ninja and he explodez! ROCK OUT! After you play a game that rocks out you're all like "that game totally fucking rocked out! ROCK!"<br/><br/>There are also games that rock in. Games that rock in are really good. These are the sorts of games where you play the game and after you play it you go "huh." And then the next day you're like "really, huh." And maybe a week later you're going "wow, that was about that? And then there was the thing where, and wow. Holy crap. That was a good game."<br/><br/>By "games" I mean "individual sessions of play" not "game rules texts."<br/><br/>There's a couple of things I want to point out with this distinction:<br/><br/>1) Story Games, the site, has a cultural bias towards rocking out over rocking in. I'm hoping that getting some terminology going can change this, so we can go "I played 'emo ninjas' last night and it totally rocked in."<br/><br/>2) Rocking out and rocking in are clearly not mutually exclusive. But are they totally orthogonal? My thought is that it's a matter of the focus of play.<br/><br/>3) Are there systematic techniques that tend one to rocking out? How about techniques that tend one to rocking in?<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Why I'm using both PTA is to show that this isn't necessarily an characteristic of game system (I want to avoid, for right now, statements like "PTA rocks in") but of game play ("Our PTA game last night totally rocked in").<br/><br/>I played most of a PTA season (disrupted by a traumatic injury to one of the players) about the Sparrkles, a magical girl rock-n-roll band from the 80s that used their mystical keytars to fight evil corporations. It had unicorns and rainbows and SPARRKLE POWER! and stuff like that. It rocked out.<br/><br/>Of course, it also contained thematic content, because it was PTA. So they were totally dealing with their issues and what have you. But it wasn't really rocking-in in a significant way.<br/><br/>Different PTA game: Blue Line City, which I played at the end of GenCon 2005 with Malcolm, Emily, Eric, and Joshua. It was a game about cartoon characters and their off-camera lives. At the end of it, there was this sense of buoyancy: the game was really good but I couldn't have totally put my finger on why. The next day, talking to Joshua, I was all like "that was about our own creative processes, wasn't it?" and he was like "yeah, I think it was" and then I realized that I needed to take the people in my fiction and games more seriously as people, and not oppress them as much as I had been.  That was rocking in.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90975/#Comment_90975" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-28T08:42:08+00:00" title="August 28, 2007  8:42AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>Not my experience.

Here's the framing/development/experience system from my Avatar game, which we used for the rocking in game Emily was talking about.<br/><br/>1. Start with a trait that the character is not satisfied with.  "I am upset with my brother."<br/>2. Declare, in-character, what you want that trait to become.  "My brother is my best friend."<br/>3. Play.<br/>4. Whenever you have a scene in which you address "I am upset with my brother," write down a summery of what happened. So...<br/><br/>&amp;#149; TRAIT: "I am upset with my brother."<br/>&amp;#149; GOAL: "My brother is my best friend."<br/>&amp;#149; SCENE 1: "Yelled at him about going out with his friends."<br/>&amp;#149; SCENE 2: "Played video games together in silence."<br/>&amp;#149; SCENE 3: "Did his laundry for him.  He mumbled thanks."<br/>&amp;#149; etc.<br/><br/>5. When you've reached a narrative plateau in struggling with the trait, turn it into a new trait.<br/>6. The new trait can't be the same as your goal, because you never get exactly what you want.<br/>7. When your character has become sufficiently dissatisfied with the new trait, pick a goal and start the process over again.<br/><br/>So, in the example, the new trait might be, "Armistice with my brother."  And the new goal could be anything.<br/><br/>I think this supports rocking in because there's a process of discovery that goes on here, with characters becoming people they don't necessarily expect, which leads into the self-reflection process that I think is a major part of rocking in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91029/#Comment_91029" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-28T10:39:03+00:00" title="August 28, 2007 10:39AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 28, 2007 10:39AM by Matt Snyder.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>Matt -- Right now, I don't know what techniques cause it.

Instead of going "After the funeral, we go and do some investigation", and playing out a long investigation scene - just stop right there, rewind, and go "First, we play out the funeral. We need to be there, in that scene, and see what it's about." <br/><br/>Rocking in means listening to yourself, I guess. And sometimes, your self isn't shouting all that loudly.

I don't see there having to be a disconnect between "rocking out" and "rocking in".  Indeed, I've found that games I've played that rocked out were also games that rocked in.  (Must...track...prepositions...)   That might be because all my games are about me or things that I think are important.<br/><br/>However, what I <i>don't</i> mean is that I know the important thing going into the game.  My experience of "rocking in" is an emergent thing.  I don't front-load with important issues.  Instead, I trust that I will naturally integrate things that I think are important into the game. <br/><br/>Rather, it is my discipline of reflecting on the various media that I take in, including the roleplaying games in which I play.  This is something that Emily Care Boss and I discussed briefly at GenCon.  She suggested including "questions for discussion" for the group to answer at the end of a game.  These should be answered purely as the audience of the story, not as a creator.<br/><br/>So, I offer some of these questions as another technique to encourage "rocking in":<br/><br/>--Did you enjoy the story?  Why?<br/>--Was there anything that happened that you wished had happened a different way?  Why?<br/>--Were you happy with the ending of the story?  Why?<br/>--Who was your favorite character?  Why?<br/><br/>I'm sure that there are better ways of phrasing these, but they provide a good start.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91094/#Comment_91094" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-28T14:03:06+00:00" title="August 28, 2007  2:03PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 28, 2007 2:04PM by Emily_Care.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The <a href="http://jeepen.org/dict/" rel="nofollow">jeeps</a> call this "playing close to home".<br/><br/>Crossing that player-character boundary is what's important. When the game touches you, and gives your room to bring in your own self, issues and desires it rocks in. 1000 Kings does this explicitly: you play "yourself", and give eachother stats based on your experience of eachother. The switch in BtI does the same thing in a very abbreviated fashion.  The conflict, in that game is where people make the choice about rocking out or in.  <br/><br/>Playing characters more like yourself gives more opportunity for putting less distancing in. Fantastic settings have that power--they take us out of our daily selves and put us into a safe place where we need not interact with our issues, or the issues that hit us daily if we choose to look at them. Games like Shock:, Dirty Secrets and Steal Away Jordan bring it back home.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91122/#Comment_91122" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-28T16:02:19+00:00" title="August 28, 2007  4:02PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 28, 2007 4:02PM by Mcdaldno.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Emily,<br/><br/>Note also that fantasy and distant worlds can also be really good for targeting our personal issues and beliefs.

But this gives me the chance to put my two cents in.  Indeed, it gives me the chance to point at my design work.<br/><br/>As noted by Emily, <i>Dirty Secrets</i> is designed to have very little distancing.  You play in your home town, last week.  The point of this is to bring the stories "close to home" very literally.  We have a thousand associations with the places where we live; gaming there provokes connections and emotions that we don't even know exist.  I want those stories to be close to home.  I want them to hurt a little when you play.  I want you to feel the heat from them.  That's how <i>Dirty Secrets</i> is supposed to provoke reflection (aka "rock in").  Another good example of this playing out is my recent game of <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=24600.0" rel="nofollow">Breaking the Ice</a>.<br/><br/><i>Legends of Alyria</i> takes the opposite route that Joe discusses.  The mechanics frame everything in terms of moral conflict, but the setting is gonzo weird fantasy, shaken together with steampunk and <i>Dragonriders of Pern</i>.  With zombies.  That's pretty distant.  However, by distancing the issues from the players, it can free them up to interact with issues in the abstract, thus enabling them to discard feelings or prejudices that might be invoked, were the story set closer to home.  Then, upon post-game reflection, the issues that were invoked can be applied to the players' real-world situation.  My first game of <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=18268.0" rel="nofollow">Polaris</a>, especially the ending, is another example of this.<br/><br/>At the same time, I will say that gamers have traditionally embraced distancing without taking up the discipline of reflection.  As a result, we use distancing to enable our power fantasies, rather than using it to enable us to better evaluate our world.  Thus the bias against distancing in certain streams of design right now.  At least, that's why <i>I</i> did it.  However, I also have high hopes that games  can be designed that will teach and encourage quality reflection through distancing.  <i>Sign in Stranger</i> has the potential to do this, I think, and I look forward to being able to give it a spin.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91159">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91159/#Comment_91159" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-28T19:05:50+00:00" title="August 28, 2007  7:05PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>Or, if Seth's still around in this thread, I like to think that <em>Sons of Liberty</em> does this, too: after you're done punching Tories in the face, you're walking around an hour later and you're thinking about what it means to be American.</blockquote>\nDoh!  I still owe you commentary from our GenCon game.  Argh!  Well, I'll give some of it now.<br/><br/><em>Sons of Liberty</em> is not a deep game.  That's not a critique.  If anything, I mean that as high praise.  It's easy to enter the game and have a massive amount of fun.  There's something special in frantically searching the table, trying to deal with the pestilent pungent putrescence that is your hand of cards.  On that level, it's like <i>Jungle Speed</i>:  fast, fierce, and frenzied.  (I'll see what other alliterations I can work in as I go.)  And, like <i>Jungle Speed</i>, that frenzy has a bonding effect on the players.  At least, that's what it seemed like from our playtest.<br/><br/>At the same time, the game pushes certain concepts and buzzwords that are uniquely American.  Rather, I should say that those concepts and buzzwords have a special place in the American myth.  I'm talking about words like "Tory" and "tyranny" and "freedom".  For crying out loud, the Tory's narrated actions are all about violating the Bill of Rights.  <br/><br/><i>Sons of Liberty</i> is all about celebrating the American myth.  Quite honestly, on the <i>Jungle Speed</i> level, the game would work just fine if you were all Space Marines trying to stop the Tyranid/Zerg menace.  (Pick whichever mythos appeals to you more.)  However, I don't think that there would be quite the same sense of desperation and drive to win.  It's like playing Reiner Knizia's <i>Lord of the Rings</i> if you're a fan of the books.  Suddenly, it's not just about moving pieces on the board and efficiently allocating damage.  It's about protecting Frodo as he is wounded again and again in body and soul.  And in <i>Sons of Liberty</i>, you are fighting to overcome an enemy that epitomizes everything UnAmerican.  I actually wonder if a foreign audience would "get it".  Maybe I'm completely wrong, and I'd be curious to hear about a playtest by folks who aren't Americans.<br/><br/>After the game, I bumped into Gregor Hutton, and I said, "I just finished playing a game of <i>Sons of Liberty</i>!  I think I'm supposed to hate you now!"  We both laughed.<br/><br/>And he's just Scottish!  Imagine if I had stumbled across an actual Englishman!<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3964#Item_8" rel="nofollow">When I posted earlier</a> about playing <i>Sons of Liberty</i>, I said, "I felt very American after playing. You can take that in the broadest way possible, including all the insulting emotive ones."  I stand by that.  On the one hand, playing the game was a great time, in which awesomeness was accomplished, like the human chain of Quakers across the mouth of Boston Harbor.  (Rock out!)  At the same time, I think that I understand being an American a bit better as a result of playing the game, including how Americans can be highly obnoxious to everyone around them.

In my very first <i>Primetime Adventures</i> game, I had a pretty traumatic experience playing a single mom in war-torn Serbia.  In hindsight, that character was all about loving something (a son, a community, a way of life) and losing it in the most horrible way possible, despite all your best efforts.  We only played 2 sessions before we ran into some mismatched agendas, but play was absolutely shattering for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, "Rock In" can be pretty powerful, but it's often an emergent effect and you need to be cautious with it.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Also - I think some characters are more "Rock In" than others; it might be a function of character concept &amp; theme, rather than whatever's going on in-session.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat's the difference between "Rock In" and "Life Now"?

I've experienced freezing up with issues because the setting I'd chosen had been too close to home for me. I based a character in a Sorcerer game my group played on someone I knew, but felt blocked and frozen about playing her to the hilt, likely because I felt guilty (and because I wasn't adequately using the darn rules of the game). And have seen people address issues like rape and murder in deep ways precisely because they were playing in a setting that gave enough distance to do so. (And because they rocked.)<br><br>I think we'll be having a good dialogue in the next couple of years about the levels we can reach by these different means.

However, I think that there's a better possibility for a group to form meaning by bringing the action close to home.  If nothing else, I learned about an organization (Humane Borders) that I never would have heard about otherwise.  And I'm guessing that the local color of the story made it easier for the players to engage with the fiction.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92847/#Comment_92847" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-03T20:05:42+00:00" title="September  3, 2007  8:05PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's no question that it bypassed a huge amount of "setting concoction", which happens in PTA and other collaborative story games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
