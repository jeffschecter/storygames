We have occasionally been in positions where someone has thrown a match because another player stood to gain a lot of cash if he won, which helps create those grudges etc you mention.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: hoog</cite>3/ could people who play without NPC boxers please elaborate a little (I see why you'd want to do that, but I'm afraid it would become too repetitive)?</blockquote>\nWhat I've seen happen in some games is that the NPCs get totally ignored.  People sometimes get totally in the zone with the rivalries and grudges between characters and lose interest in the NPCs.  Which is cool.<br/><br/>It also depends on the size of the game.  I think that 4 players is the sweet spot, but with 5+ there's more other PCs to wail on and the need for NPCs is less.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: hoog</cite>4/ any advice on how to connect the protagonists' stories (which happened in my previous games, but not enough yesterday)?</blockquote>\nDrive those Jokers.  Play with a deck which has 4 jokers if you want to make them come up more.<br/><br/>Try to get people to take related (or even the same) connections.  I see no reason that two (or more) players can't have the same person as a connection.<br/><br/>Dunno if that helps?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98428/#Comment_98428" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-23T10:12:20+00:00" title="September 23, 2007 10:12AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            2.  It's never been a problem for us, because there's an upper limit on what you can spend in training.  <br/><br/>3.  We don't use NPC boxers.  At first we did, but they became tactical punching bags and weren't that interesting.  If you want to drive relationships (see #4), make people fight each other.<br/><br/>4.  There's nothing that says you can't share connections, or that another boxer's connections can't mean something to you short of threatening or stealing them.  It's also useful to tie each other together initially in any way you can.  Always be looking for ways to tie stories together - have everyone go to the same couple of gyms for training scenes, so the trainer can build rivalries, for example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98621">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hoog" title="hoog"><img alt="hoog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hoog">hoog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98621/#Comment_98621" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T10:13:55+00:00" title="September 24, 2007 10:13AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            say, how do you guys manage the promo scenes, when you're playing without NPC boxers, and when there's a disagreement about the split or the number of rounds?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98630/#Comment_98630" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T10:22:15+00:00" title="September 24, 2007 10:22AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure we had disagreements in our Contenders.

The PC would look at his..uh...stat that said how long he lasted (forget the name) compared to the NPC boxer's stat.  And then he would request a fight that would tire the NPC out.  Or if his was lower, he would request a short 3-rounder.<br/><br/>So then you had a negotiation between a player who really cared about his PC boxer and another player who was playing an NPC promoter who wasn't necessarily interested in what the NPC boxer thought.<br/><br/>We ended up having a little disconnect there and the PC boxer could usually cajole and get close to the rounds he wanted.<br/><br/>Perhaps the more reason to stick to PC boxers only.  It sounds like that is a better way to drive character conflict, anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98692/#Comment_98692" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T12:34:12+00:00" title="September 24, 2007 12:34PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, but if I'm playing the NPC boxer in that case... if I win then I knock YOUR Conditioning down with any damage I cause and then we're both in the shit at the end of each round (and I'll probably outgun you in something else like Power).<br/><br/>I love knocking Conditioning through the floor and having slightly longer matches.
