If you make otherkind right, there is no status quo. It also automatically correlates the fictional worlds between the players - if they are not correlated, they will be afterwards. It is also very flexible in what it resolves.<br/>Here is one of vincents posts regarding otherkind.<br/><a href="http://www.lumpley.com/archive/148.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.lumpley.com/archive/148.html</a><br/><br/>There is also another cool element present in otherkind. There must be a danger included in your roll. It becomes sort of a mechanized version of "say yes or roll the dice." no danger, no otherkind. Say yes if you find no danger.<br/><br/>But, it has a, for me, glaring flaw. Atleast for what i want to use it to. <br/>Otherkind resolution requires <i>a lot</i> of "footwork" after calling, but before rolling. Combine this with the question of intent, and Play grinds to a halt as fiction is correlated, because the whole collage must be correlated as the mechanics are called upon. After the roll, there is again interpretation and correlation. It is stakes set-at-the-moment taken to an extreme.<br/>I would imagine this goes away after a lot of play through system mastery, but some systems have tried to split this task over a time frame or over different mechanical interpretations.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>I know it has already been split into apocalypse, blades and more. But those remove the collage of fiction for ease of use. <br/><br/>If the way of resolving otherkind can be split into multiple fragments, but preserving the collage generated, focusing attention on the interaction one wants for the premise of the game, we got ourselves very strong resolution system. <br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Let me come with two examples of what i mean<br/><br/>"Thus began the adventures of Eowyn" starts with a single resolution of stakes in Yes/no form. But you can push it, and add additional dangers, for a more beneficial way to interpret the dice. This is otherkind resolution broken down into different mechanical units within the same resolution.<br/>In addition, there are risks for you to take. Each risk taken gives you a die, but you must put a number on the risk. If that number comes up on any die, the risk comes true.  <br/><br/>maybe it is personal, but i think that this way is a lot more easy to resolve than "normal" otherkind. And just as strong, if not stronger.<br/><br/>Here is the link if anyone is interested.<br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/20513/thus-began-the-adventures-of-eowyn#latest" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/20513/thus-began-the-adventures-of-eowyn#latest</a><br/><br/>---<br/><br/>I really do think that otherkind, for its age, is super powerful tech. <br/>Can we usher some of the resolution away into procedures?<br/>Can we build GM/player principles into the resolution, to foster a better, more fruitful environment?<br/>Can we use other forms of mechanics to lessen footwork?<br/>Can we spread said footwork over time and mechanics, so people have it nearly-resolved when they begin rolling?<br/>Can we turn some elements of the resolution into ritual phrases? <br/>How can otherkind be used to spotlight the interaction you want the players to have?<br/>And how?<br/><br/>---<br/>A discussion regarding the depths of otherkind resolution could shed light on some cool mechanics.<br/>That and i think that the potential in otherkind is immense, and skimmed over, maybe because of its "weightfulness."?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451156/#Comment_451156" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-06T13:57:07+00:00" title="February  6, 2016  1:57PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A lot of these issues could be tackled by folding more of the mechanics into the character sheet: imagine an Otherkind game where the character's choices are separated into boxes on a playsheet, either at the game design or character creation step.<br/><br/><i>Example No.1: Ninjaworld</i><br/>Everyone in this game plays a Ninja, so all the PCs have identical boxes on their character sheets for things like "Do this quickly", "Do this stealthily", "Do this without collateral", "Do this without breaking my vow" and so on.<br/><br/><i>Example No.2: Actionworld</i><br/>Everyone in this game plays an action movie star, so though they have similarities, they all have their own specialisations chosen at character creation, so the Driver has "Lose my pursuers" and "Don't wreck my ride", where the Hacker has "Eavesdrop on their conversation" and "Shift the blame elsewhere."<br/><br/>In either case, a lot of the decision making is made before you begin playing, by identifying the most common outcomes the players want from their characters: when a PC acts, the player puts tokens on their character sheet in the boxes they are using. After the roll, they assign the dice to the boxes with tokens in.<br/><br/>If I've understood the OP's points correctly, this tackles the last three points on the list:<br/><i>Can we put said footwork "back in time", so people have it nearly-resolved when they begin rolling?</i><br/>Yes, by simplyfying the range of choices and identifying the mostly commonly desired ones before we start to play.<br/><br/><i>Can we turn some elements into ritual phrases? </i><br/>Yes, by creating character sheets around a framework of ritual phrases.<br/><br/><i>How can otherkind be used to spotlight the interaction you want the players to have?</i><br/>By putting some choices on the character sheet in advance, before the players even start to choose &amp; create characters: this weights the outcomes, and therefore the story, in the direction you want your game to have.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451159">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451159/#Comment_451159" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-06T16:42:33+00:00" title="February  6, 2016  4:42PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            3xJ,<br/><br/>It's quite interesting that you brought this up, because I designed the conflict system in <i>Thus Began the Adventures of Eowyn</i> precisely as an attempt to give the Otherkind procedure a more flexible/step-by-step method.<br/><br/>I think it worked, and it's a lot of fun in play, but since then I've been trying to take it further.

I could play Eowyn for a long time! (i am going to write about a single theoretical gripe i have with it in your thread.) <br/><br/>I salute your effort ! Do you want to skype/talk about your findings. i am much better at talking and writing deliberated texts than writing forum posts. Deliberated forum posts take up so much time!<br/><br/>James_Mullen, that design is really cool! I have to check Psi*run out then Paul.<br/>But by having these pre-determined options, i worry: <br/>If they are the only possible or the greatest options, then you may "box in" what the characters can do. This reminds me of "dream askew" where your strong/weak/normal moves are written directly unto your sheet, some broader than others, and they are what you can do with rules supporting them. If there is something that breaks my interest in a game, it is the "no, you cant shoot now" kind of thing. (the game is damn cool, so try it if you can, but i get a certain sense of boxed-in-ness.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451165">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451165/#Comment_451165" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-06T18:31:04+00:00" title="February  6, 2016  6:31PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure, I'd be up for a chat, and we could compare notes.

I've got a few functioning prototypes, but each has unexpected downsides. I have not yet managed a "best of both worlds" version; indeed, that may turn out to be impossible.<br/><br/>I'd love to hear about theoretical gripes about Eowyn in the other thread,  as well! Please do so.<br/><br/>As for "boxed-in" factor, Ps*Run has that in spades: what allows the very specific "boxes" to be drawn on the sheet is that the game is about a VERY specific scenario with pre-set dangers. The entire game is basically a drawn-out chase scene. Eowyn's Adventures was my attempt to do something a little more generic and flexible with a similar approach. (If you ignore the "ghost" stuff in the fourth column, the first three are intended to cover most likely factors, with the Narrator's second question covering anything left out by those dangers.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451166/#Comment_451166" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-06T18:56:45+00:00" title="February  6, 2016  6:56PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some more thoughts...<br/><br/>To "split" the atom, as you put it, there are two potentially separate axes to consider:<br/><br/>* The developing fiction, and our narration of it.

When you push it, and add "dangers", we did narrate their entrance, or what was dangerous about them. if not, we made clear what could happen. It sort of fictional prompt + unresolved ending. So fiction was generated mid/roll. The following was not what happened in our play, but how it generally happens.<br/><br/>PLAYER: "I will not let him die, i <i>push on</i> and barge through the door. <br/><b>will i get to Eiras before they run him through?</b> *picks up dice, waits for me*<br/>ME: "As you barge through the door, some of Haradrim are advancing on the boy. Two of them stand at the ready, just in front of you. Gleaming silver arcs streak through the air as they try to strike you." <br/><b>Will you recieve a wound to your shoulder by poisoned haradrim blades as you to get to Eiras?</b><br/>now he rolls. (he could also risk something, and now, we are filling undiscussed creative space on the game.)<br/><br/>so it does stretch. Maybe you should proceduralize it? It is hard (atleast for me) to stop thinking in math and "hard mechanics" once i am working on such.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>One could see dogs in the vineyard as stretched out otherkind dice in that way. first, set the goal, then shift to see what happens within that nucleus of actions and reactions. But i guess nearly every conflict resolution system does that. BUt dogs in the vineyard specifically says what you can talk about or cannot talk about regarding the stake and the fiction beforehand, building fiction which again, must be acknowledged. And it is the fiction on the way to said stake that is the center of dogs in the vineyard.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>What i am basically trying to do in my current version is setting up conflicts so they can fractalize down into single, unopposed, but dangerous tasks "will i cross the bridge in this ungodly storm." to more poignant conflicts where the opposition has an undefined intent regarding the stake. + in eowyns dangers, and the game is now asking some completely different questions.<br/>But sadly, there are speed bumps. <br/><br/>---                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451169/#Comment_451169" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-06T21:09:27+00:00" title="February  6, 2016  9:09PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lately, I've been interested in OD&amp;D, which uses a single d6 for resolving a lot of delving tasks: opening doors, hearing noise, do you set off the trap, is there a wandering monster, and so on. It struck me that this is pretty ripe for an Otherkind interpretation. Demihumans get two or three dice, take the best, when hearing noise; maybe battering a door lets you roll open doors and wandering monster at the same time, and so on. To the extent it purports to use Chainmail for combat, and as far as Chainmail uses opposed d6 pools for 20:1 battles, that system might also be Otherkindable.

Which means that, as long as the range of possible moves stays within a sane number, there's little or no discussion about either when to engage the resolution system or such details of engagement as "stakes", intent or whatever.<br/>Additionally, with a set of choices well-tailored to the triggering event, defining fictional outcomes in detail still takes some thought but, usually, just a little.<br/>Thus: having all these similar but distinct subsystems for all possible kinds of conflict in your game makes for a more agile Otherkind implementation than having just one generic, all-purpose conflict system.<br/><br/>2. In <i>Bliss Stage</i>, which was published long before <i>Psi*Run</i> AFAIK, there is only one kind of (Otherkind based) conflict resolution. It's only employed in Mission actions (BS action = scene, basically), but Mission actions make up at least half of the game.<br/>Its trigger is very generic, not unlike Psi*Run: you roll when you face any danger and/or have a chance to achieve a mission objective. But, since every Mission actions culminates with a roll, it's more of a matter of pacing than framing conflicts: not much to learn here, except maybe that the broader structure of a game, its fictional and mechanical arcs, can greatly simplify this step by front-loading it.<br/>After rolling, it usually takes a while for the player to strategically allocate dice between a large number of priorities - because these choices are extremely consequential and their consequences almost always tragic. But then the mission just moves on: the fictional consequences of those choices are <i>not</i> immediately highlighted and described. Rather, the player's choices are recorded as a set of abstract, mostly numerical parameters. Later, the (dramatic and decisive) consequences of those choices are explored and played out during different scenes, especially scenes involving no dice-rolling per se, and those consequences further acted upon, etc.<br/>So, the big trick here is that (most) outcomes are long-term ones and their narration is delayed accordingly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451174/#Comment_451174" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-07T02:10:14+00:00" title="February  7, 2016  2:10AM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting thoughts.<br/><br/>On OD&amp;D: When we played B/X D&amp;D on IRC two years ago, we often used "roll an extra die" in lieu of a +1 (the odds are fairly close), so it's certainly doable. In a D&amp;D context, however, it's not clear how to parse and weight "dangers" (and, in most D&amp;D d6 actions, adding a danger would often remove the whole point of the roll, since typically the most obvious danger would be being spotted by monsters, and the intent of the character rolling is to complete their task before this happens).<br/><br/>Apocalypse World does a nice job of short-cutting the negotiation part of Otherkind dice with preset moves, but at the cost of flexibility. (You can have a lot of really interesting outcomes in an Otherkind-based system which aren't easily possible in Apocalypse World.) I'm still thinking about the tradeoff here, and whether it's desirable or not for certain purposes.\n<blockquote><br/>2. In <i>Bliss Stage</i>, which was published long before <i>Psi*Run</i> AFAIK</blockquote>\nMy understand is that Ps*Run was published more recently, but was designed and played far earlier (and possibly an influence on <i>Bliss Stage</i>). In fact, it was the first game to use Otherkind dice (other than Otherkind itself, of course, and the freeform experiment for which they were invented in the first place). My memory here could be faulty, however!<br/><br/>3xJ,<br/><br/>I agree with you about Eowyn, but it doesn't always work this way. It's up to the players to narrate the dangers and questions as they like. Sometimes that could mean adding to the fiction (as in your example), sometimes not.<br/><br/>So I'm not sure what you mean by "proceduralize it". If you mean insisting that there always be some kind of narration, I think I'm somewhat against it, although, in practice, that's what I do as much as possible.<br/><br/>Did you actually play the game? (If you did, I'd like to hear about it!)<br/><br/>As for Dogs in the Vineyard and similar extended conflicts, that was one of my realizations concerning a step-by-step Otherkind system: although it sounds really interesting in theory, actually playtesting it with a friend felt *very* similar to any kind of task resolution-based scene (like a D&amp;D combat scene!). As a result, I'm now wondering whether that's a desirable thing or no.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I have a bunch of drafts which are potentially interesting and which we could discuss, if you'd like. As you're seeing yourself, there are a number of surprising "bumps" and challenges involved in designing such a procedure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451175/#Comment_451175" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-07T02:52:07+00:00" title="February  7, 2016  2:52AM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 7, 2016 5:11AM by Rickard.">edited February 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In <a href="https://semielgames.wordpress.com/2012/07/25/the-coyotes-of-chicago-playtest-document/" rel="nofollow">The Coyotes of Chicago</a>, there is one player and several game masters.

Each point spent is described by the game master and the player can come up with something extra to gain from this conflict.

It prompted me to finish reading the Adventures of Eowyn, too, which is very interesting.<br/><br/>One thing which always seemed cumbersome about basic Otherkind is the gradient of success on each die. You're not only assigning the dice, but also going through an additional step of interpretation for each category.<br/>The binary "You answer/GM answers" outcomes in Eowyn are a big step forward in ease of use. I used a similar binary implementation using coin flips in <a href="http://tenthousandmogs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Cats-Materials1.5.pdf" rel="nofollow">this game about cats</a>. The cats game never really worked well, but might have some pieces worth dissecting. <br/><br/>In Cats, each character sheet has a unique list of elements to assign coins to when they make a move. My experience was that having all of these elements in play for every roll was too derailing. Every move generated some kind of left-field complication.<br/><br/>I haven't played Eowyn, but the fiction-led, step-by-step introduction of these complicating elements seems like a big advance. Love the character sheet interface with "place a die on the dangers you're risking."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451186/#Comment_451186" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-07T22:18:56+00:00" title="February  7, 2016 10:18PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 7, 2016 10:28PM by Paul_T.">edited February 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Dirk!<br/><br/>I'm very happy with "Eowyn"; it's been a blast to play, and the resolution feels satisfying without being too heavy.<br/><br/>I'll take a look at "Cats", it looks interesting!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dirk" title="Dirk"><img alt="Dirk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dirk">Dirk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452169/#Comment_452169" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-12T16:19:29+00:00" title="April 12, 2016  4:19PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Been thinking more about this, working on a little remix of Eowyn dice. One problem I've had with otherkind dice is the amount of synthesis required, and the fraying of the narrative thread that can happen when you get all this new information at once. The following is an attempt to introduce and resolve complications more sequentially, and allow players to gradually raise stakes in a conflict.<br/><br/>Paul had earlier prompted me to look at Vincent Baker's swashbuckling romance game, which really got me excited about question asking as a primary means of resolution, so there's a lot of that DNA in this, too.\n<blockquote>To resolve a tense, risky or uncertain situation, say what you want and assemble a pool of dice. One die to start, plus any others indicated by your character sheet. Add dice from your pool if you like. Ask the GM how many hits you need, probably between one and five. Roll your dice and count hits.<br/><br/>Accept the result or ask a question below to keep rolling (after each question, roll one more die.)<br/><br/>Keep going until you get the hits you need or choose to stop. You can\u2019t ask the same question twice. Basically, you can keep raising the stakes in order to press on toward your goal, but each thing happens sequentially, and the answers to your questions are firm. Like hard moves, they\u2019re things that just happen. No \u201cmoves snowball\u201d here. Or rather, the snowballing is fully encompassed by this one act of resolution.<br/><br/>The lists of questions could be tailored to different situations, like so:<br/><br/>For crossing blade with blade:<br/>-I open a momentary gap in my defenses, how will they exploit it?<br/>-I lose my footing for a moment, will they corner me or drive me back?<br/>-As I press in close, what do they grab from my person?<br/>-I hear something clatter to the ground, what have I lost?<br/>-I pursue them through strange grounds; what ambush gathers around me?<br/>-I press on heedless of my companions, what danger now advances upon them?<br/>-I expose myself to grave harm, where will they drive home their blow?<br/>-I break with them, circling; will they run or rejoin the fight?<br/>-I turn to run, will they pursue me?<br/>-I place myself at their mercy, what will they do with me?<br/><br/><br/>For pressing on in the face of grave harm:<br/>-What lasting mark will this leave upon me?<br/>-If I go on now, I\u2019ll be laid out later; how long must I lie in recovery? <br/>-What part of me must be sacrificed to preserve the whole?<br/>-Soon, I\u2019ll surely die without the aid of\u2026<br/>-To go on now will surely be my last act<br/><br/>For acting covertly:<br/>-What trace of myself do I leave behind?<br/>-I must proceed in haste, what detail do I overlook?<br/>-I go mostly unnoticed, save by whose eyes?<br/>-I find myself cut off from my companions, what lies between us?<br/></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452171/#Comment_452171" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-12T17:58:04+00:00" title="April 12, 2016  5:58PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Does Prime Time Adventures fit in this continuum, too?

Sometimes it felt like hashing out the potential outcomes OOC was the actual game system, and the roll was almost anticlimactic.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452187/#Comment_452187" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-13T19:40:42+00:00" title="April 13, 2016  7:40PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting stuff!<br/><br/>I like the Eowyn/swashbuckling game hybrid (although it's not really Otherkind dice, in my opinion - but it's a nice "accept a complication to roll again" mechanic, with added flavour from the questions).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452188/#Comment_452188" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-13T19:41:38+00:00" title="April 13, 2016  7:41PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            PTA does have this as an issue as well (heh), although it's not like Otherkind, since noone chooses which outcomes happen instead of others.
