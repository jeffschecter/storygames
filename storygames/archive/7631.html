Examples from popular fiction include destroying the Deathstar (or even overthrowing the galactic empire if you want to go all the way) or reclaiming the dwarves' treasure from the dragon Smaug. <br/><br/>After campaign setup you create the characters who will be taking part in the story. Creation of characters uses a life-path system. Your characters will typically be around 20 years old at the start of play, and aside from the first four years of your life (your "Born As" period), you may choose your life's path in 1-year increments. Given a generic fantasy setting with humans, elves, dwarves and orcs as playable races, here is my challenge/request to you all:<br/><br/>1. If it were your choice, what would be your End Game Goal?<br/>2. How would you build your character's life-path from birth to ~20 years old?<br/><br/>An example life-path for a nobly-born academic:<br/><br/>0 to 4: Born Noble<br/>5 to 7 Student<br/>8 to 11 Scholar<br/>12 to 19 Tenured Scholar<br/>20 to 21 (present) Master Scholar<br/><br/>Another example, for a farm-boy cum mercenary:<br/><br/>0 to 4 Born Farmer<br/>5 to 7 Farmer<br/>8 to 9 Novice Blacksmith<br/>10 to 12 Conscript<br/>12 to 15 Trooper<br/>16 to 19 (present) Mercenary<br/><br/>So now it's your turn... Help a guy out!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage" title="Number6intheVillage"><img alt="Number6intheVillage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.johnkantor.com/miscl/prisoner_ringtiny.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage">Number6intheVillage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169706/#Comment_169706" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-17T14:47:09+00:00" title="September 17, 2008  2:47PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 17, 2008 2:47PM by Number6intheVillage.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A female child stolen and raised by gypsies<br/><br/>Personal Goal: learn her true identity and birthright (which should fit in with just about any group goal)<br/><br/>0: born as ?<br/>1-5: beggar<br/>6-8: beggar and pickpocket<br/>9-11: acrobat and thief<br/>12-15: dancer and burglar<br/>16-18: actress, prostitute, and robber<br/>19-20: courtesan and assassin.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169722/#Comment_169722" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-17T16:45:44+00:00" title="September 17, 2008  4:45PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice. <br/><br/>Let's see if I can pick out the story here.. <br/><br/>Born to family unknown, and stolen as an infant by gypsies, she was raised to beg and steal whenever the company met with others. Possibly around age 12, she may have left the gypsies to make her own way in the world, or maybe she stayed, but moved on to more daring larceny. By 16, it's fairly clear that she'd parted ways with the company and made her living by various unvirtuous means. At 19, she may have caught the eye of someone of influence and moved into high society, either on her own terms, or after being prepared by someone who wished her to take contracts to kill. <br/><br/>It's funny that you picked a personal goal, as choosing and accomplishing personal goals is integral to the play of the game, though I did not address it here.<br/><br/>One thing I'm seeing here is that you're not picking specific single focus life path steps. Everything from age 6 onward is "this and that". Is 'multiclassing' like this something that you think is required for this character, or would picking one of each choice, with some flexibility in additional skills learned, still work out?<br/><br/>For ex:<br/><br/>0 to 4: "born" a gypsy<br/>5 to 8: beggar<br/>9 to 11: thief<br/>12 to 15: burglar<br/>16 to 18: actress<br/>19 to 20: assassin<br/><br/>Each segment would have certain skills learned and would describe in broad terms what your character did during that time, but in each, you'd be able to learn, and do, other things. Your beggar period would allow you to learn/practice pickpocketing skills, your thief years would allow you to be acrobatic (and perform as an acrobat, if you chose). Your time as a burglar could be shared by a "day job" as a dancer, and actresses are (stereotypically) considered much the same as prostitutes and robbers. Finally, what better cover than courtesan would allow you to practice your craft as an assassin among the elite of society?<br/><br/>I ask both the original request/question and these follow-up questions to get an idea of what sort of paths an interesting character might follow, and to consider different methods of applying the life path segments to the mechanical aspects of character building.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage" title="Number6intheVillage"><img alt="Number6intheVillage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.johnkantor.com/miscl/prisoner_ringtiny.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage">Number6intheVillage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169770/#Comment_169770" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-17T22:20:28+00:00" title="September 17, 2008 10:20PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 17, 2008 10:52PM by Number6intheVillage.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think lots of life paths consist of complementary - or even contradictory experiences. The gypsy girl would have to have a reasonably acceptable public vocation and persona, yet to improve her lot in life, she chooses crime. (I was assuming she was a gypsy for all but the last step - working her way up in the group as her skills improved and she matured into different roles.)<br/><br/>Look at someone like Cardinal Richelieu - both the character and the historical person. He had one religious identity, one public political identity, and one for covert intrigue.<br/><br/>Your mercenary might also have been a local thug in his spare time, hiring out at first for odd jobs and then extorting protection money on his own - maybe even starting a gang. And not necessarily without some rationale - he could be doing all that in the name of a local religious cult that he fervently believes in.<br/><br/>Meanwhile the scholar could be spending his spare time researching anything from alchemy to the dark arts to engineering (like Da Vinci).<br/><br/>I'd suggest that characters have both public personal goals and private ones.<br/><br/>And actually that brings up another point: most people don't have goals. (That tends to be more of a dramatic literary device.) Instead they have motivations - often ones they are not fully aware of.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169777/#Comment_169777" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-17T23:40:32+00:00" title="September 17, 2008 11:40PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I think lots of life paths consist of complementary - or even contradictory experiences</blockquote>\nRight, entirely understood. My question was coming from the standpoint of building the mechanics. To create this character, would you have to "multiclass", or could just choosing the single lifepath, then selecting skills that reflect the other aspect of the character's life work just as well? The idea is that the lifepath chosen reflects a broad-strokes idea of how the character spent their life during that period. In the selection of the skills and other traits gained during that period, you'll further flesh out the details. One of my goals with using a lifepath system is to generate at least a loose backstory for the character as a byproduct of character generation. \n<blockquote>(I was assuming she was a gypsy for all but the last step - working her way up in the group as her skills improved and she matured into different roles.)</blockquote>\nOkay, cool. My reading was based on my own perception of gypsies, which includes a very tightly knit family structure, which wouldn't allow for one of their own to be a prostitute. I also saw burglar as being more of a townie, though I suppose it's just as feasible for a wandering gypsy to burgle. That's why it'd be your character, not mine!<br/><br/>As for personal goals, I should elaborate just a bit: Goals are not necessarily goals that the character has chosen. They are goals you have chosen for the character. They may reflect goals that the character themselves have set, or they may be entirely in conflict with the character's own goals. What's important is that the mechanical Goals you choose are something that you, as a player, would like to see accomplished during play. <br/><br/>Frex, if Han Solo were a PC, his player may have chosen the goal of "Get Leia to marry me" (which eventually happens, I'm lead to believe) but the character of Han thinks she's a stuck up busy-body, and wants nothing to do with her after he gets his reward money. (Yes, I'm aware that Han's motivations involving Leia were less one-sided.. It's an example, go with it). <br/><br/>Productive, thought provoking conversation here, thank you. Anyone else want to toss their hat into the ring?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
