And as you've told your friends about it you've gotten requests to join the game, which you've had to refuse. Woe the fifth wheels of the gaming community! Alas, <a href="http://wilper.wordpress.com/while-the-world-ends/" rel="nofollow">While the World Ends</a> is only for four players.  Fret not, I have now built a game that you not only can - but must -  play with five participants.  <br/><br/>Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce you to <a href="http://wilper.wordpress.com/the-daughters-of-verona/" rel="nofollow">The Daughters of Verona</a>!<br/><br/><a href="http://wilper.wordpress.com/the-daughters-of-verona/" rel="nofollow">The Daughters of Verona</a> is my game from Game Chef 2011, now polished and pretty.  Go ahead! Download this free and awesome game of Shakespearean comedy.<br/><br/>In four hours the five participants play a comedy (ends with a marriage) containing staples of the genre like Shipwrecks, Crossdressing heroines, Bedtricks and many other hilarious events. No prep*! Just fun!<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>On a more serious note, we have now played the game and it was very fun**. I wonder if I should go ahead and try to source actual real printing of the cards, to sell on the Internet. I would appreciate your comments and feedback on the game.  The rules are just four pages long, and there's a strong emergent quality to the game.  <br/><br/><br/>* It's quite a bit of work to print and cut all the cards that are needed.  Let the fifth player do that while you play another awesome session of <a href="http://wilper.wordpress.com/while-the-world-ends/" rel="nofollow">While the World Ends</a>.<br/><br/>** By act 3 I laughed so hard my jaw ached.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_348172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348172/#Comment_348172" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-07T01:47:39+00:00" title="November  7, 2011  1:47AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 7, 2011 2:08AM by Wilhelm.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran a game of TDoV at S\xe4vCon XI.
