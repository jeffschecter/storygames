There is concern that the adoption of e-reader devices will eliminate the protection of selling large books that are too much of a hassle to steal and then read from a computer or print out.<br/>\n<br/>\nRelevant links:<br/>\n- Will Books Be Napsterized? <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://tinyurl.com/y96f9cs" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/y96f9cs</a><br/>\n- The Book Industry is in Trouble. But Piracy is Just a Symptom. <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://tinyurl.com/ybup3fr" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/ybup3fr</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIn physical distribution, there is explicit control over who can sell, at what price, and when. With digital, control goes right out the window. With a lack of control, price pressure follows as customers have more choices. Especially between buying and stealing (if we don't want to call downloading stealing, no problem, just insert your word of choice).<br/>\n<br/>\nCustomers know that digital goods should be less expensive than physical ones and demand unrestricted access to digital versions minus rights management and other security measures. It took the music industry 7 years till iTunes emerged and in that time people downloaded whatever they wanted for free.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe book industry is only making some of their products available digitally and are trying to hold prices at similar levels as physical books.<br/>\n<br/>\nI worked in the music industry for 11+ years and had access to millions of dollars of thorough market research. Often what people say isn't what they do. Many people have found that buying directly from an artist or even paying less isn't the number one factor in peoples consumption decisions. People will pay $4 for a $1 song on their phones. Or will buy from a retailer even when an artist is offering the products directly. Even when it is cheaper or loaded with premium bonuses. Generally people are driven by convenience. Price some close. But convenience rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, it's easier to get sucked into a price undercutting war, especially with online commerce (even with physical products). People lower prices. Large retailers like Amazon demand a larger percentage, so the content owner gets paid less, and Amazon can charge less and still make the same amount of profit as a competitor plus charge a markup on shipping for extra profit. Or a retailer will price certain products to specifically lose money but beat their competition in the hopes of attracting customers and make up their profits on other products. A lot of indie video game developers are getting hosed this way (more of a reason to be very careful of the terms of the contracts you sign with distributors and publishers). And as the perceived value of products keeps going down, the companies that survive are the ones that are more flexible and have lower cost structure (which sometimes mean lower quality materials or paying employees less).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd customers are demanding more and more. More services, more support, more guarantees.<br/>\n<br/>\nRelevant links:<br/>\n- The Impact of Social Media on the Enterprise. <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://tinyurl.com/ydl472x" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/ydl472x</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWhich necessitates higher costs as profit margins shrink. A lot of new companies start up that operate on a loss for the first few years. Since they are losing money anyway, they cut prices to be more competitive because it isn't about making money at first for them. A lot of businesses are being set up so that selling their main products aren't actually what drives their profit structures. Big name musicians giving away music in exchange for a larger audience and then recouping with sponsorships, licensing music to TV, Film, video games, live performances, launching acting or writing careers, and more.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich isn't a new thing by any means. Take McDonalds. McDonalds isn't about selling burgers and fries. It was a real estate play. Franchise fees were setup so that if you wanted to operate a McDonalds, McDonalds would buy the land the store occupied and the store operators covered all the real estate costs.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's unclear how things will pan out. I don't think the perception of the value of books is taking a nose dive like with music. Books for the most part are already reasonably priced. And I don't know many people who own e-readers yet.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_235516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235516/#Comment_235516" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-04T11:23:15+00:00" title="October  4, 2009 11:23AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that there's a false correlation in the minds of, well, everyone between price and piracy. Media, in the modern world, is cheap. By and large*. By "cheap" I mean "most people can afford it if they want it."<br><br>People don't pirate shit because they can't afford it. They pirate shit because it's popular, they want it, and piracy is easy to do. If you're popular, you get pirated. If you're not popular, you don't get pirated. It's basically that simple. It does not matter what you charge.<br><br>F'rinstance, Houses of the Blooded is considerably more popular than Bliss Stage. I charge $10 for Bliss Stage eBooks (until recently, $13, which is fucking unheard of for a role-playing game). John charges $5 for Houses of the Blooded. Who would bet that there's more Bliss Stage than Houses on the piracy networks? Not me.<br><br>My approach to the issue is to simply make a direct appeal. I make it clear that I'm an individual producer, and this money matters to me. If you look at the disclaimer at the back of Maid RPG, that's a pretty good indication of my views on the subject (and a similar disclaimer is going in all my new eBooks.) For those rare few who don't have Maid, here's what it says, roughly: "So, you pirated this game. Well, play it! It only takes a couple of hours and it's fun. And when you're done, consider kicking us some money for a legit eBook copy, so we can feed poor Ewen and get him to translate more books from Japanese."<br><br>Does that stop piracy? No. But I don't care about pirates. I can't. They're not my customers. The point isn't to stop piracy as much as it is to convert pirate consumers into actual customers, which are the people who I do care about.<br><br>If any publishers have ideas for a better approach I'd like to hear it.<br><br>yrs--<br>--Ben<br><br>* Textbooks and academic journals excepted. These use an interesting system: they sell to captive audiences (libraries and students) at high prices and just assume a fair amount of piracy (in the form of textbook packets, etc.) is going to take place. This would be like me charging $200 for a game and just assuming that only 50 or so people would actually bother paying. It's also the business model of most office and design software. I find it compelling, but probably I couldn't get away with charging $200 for a game, so ...<br><br>P.S. To steal a book is an elegant offense.

Sometimes old material will come back into print. Or be added to a compilation. Or the author wanted it out of print for a reason. There are pros and cons to all of this. And then there is the question of information being available for the benefit of society and the original intentions of copyright or what rights you retain once you release information to the world at large. In our research we found that although many people would often download material no longer for sale, if it was next to material that was for sale and of similar interest, they would grab that as well. And sometimes material is available for sale but people weren't aware.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor this specific discussion, I think we should focus on material for sale and less about piracy in general (although that could make a great new thread).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, a correction to the above, several of my friends who work at libraries noted that library use is actually up in many places (although funding is being cut).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_235530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235530/#Comment_235530" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-04T12:59:03+00:00" title="October  4, 2009 12:59PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The no-on-saw-it-coming popularity of TV Show DVDs shows that the comnparison isn't one to one.

At this point people still seem to get media attention for moralistic opinions on how piracy is stealing and whatnot, but that's just because the majority has still to work out the implications of what digital duplication technology does to many forms of traditional IP. Once the reality hits (which it is currently doing), it'll soon become obvious that it's laughable to require people to keep paying for things purely out of willingness to support outmoded production practices. Some still might - there are people who are willing to pay premium for handmade clothing or whatnot - but the majority will accept a shift in technology. The successful cultury industry will learn to work with technology instead of trying to futilely smash the new machinery so their craftsmen can still continue to gain their living the way they've been going about it for the last hundred years.<br><br>From this viewpoint I'd say that the question is not whether people will steal books unless they're cheap enough. The question has to be how we will structure the publishing industry once book as a commercial entity becomes marginalized in favour of instant, free digital duplication of contents that were traditionally published as books. Locking down the Internet and making piracy illegal is not going to work any more than limiting new technology has worked in the past, so the smart publisher will focus his attention on developing alternative business models for the time when copyright won't protect his commercial rights anymore.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_235533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235533/#Comment_235533" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-04T13:35:49+00:00" title="October  4, 2009  1:35PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Judd: I'm a huge fan of that article, actually, and I'm purposefully drawing on it.

My experiences in writing <i>World of Near</i> made me conclude that not only is the book a somewhat suspect form of distribution for a roleplaying game, but also something like half of all rpgs are not actually discrete units to begin with, but rather living traditions - traditions for which any given book is an imperfect vehicle of expression to begin with. I won't be missing the book at all when it comes to rpgs, it'll only benefit the culture if and when the book gets booted out of its dominant position as a vehicle for rpg material.<br/><br/>As for replacements - had I seen Solar System as clearly two years ago as I see it now, I'd probably have opted for a subscription website instead of a series of books as my publication model. A tool-box type game like that (which category already covers the majority of traditional games) will only benefit when publishers move into providing continuous services like what they're doing for D&amp;D, with books becoming a secondary spin-off product. For the rest of the games, those that won't benefit from continuous development and community elements, those will probably have to be accessorized into boardgames (so you're selling the components and not the rules), or published under ultra-competitive ransom conditions.<br/><br/>(I should note that nobody needs to tell me how difficult it is to get a ransom going. I expect that conventions will be established to smooth things over, and much of the stuff created nowadays will simply be left out in the cold by the new, competitive marketplace. I can't predict how severe this will be, but the absolute monetary value of the culture industry will probably be sharply cut at least temporarily while everybody figures out how to deal with unlimited mainstream piracy.)<br/><br/>An interesting thought in this context is whether you could publish a rpg-like product with the same logic that most of high-end television production uses: sell advertising space in the initial free publications and publish definitive editions without adverts later. In that sort of thing you'd probably try to make the initial advertisement/patronage money pay for the initial expenses of design and writing, with some long-term profit originating in the sales of premium paper versions or whatnot. This seems to be working for television series, as Judd mentions - I'm not expecting it to work for more than a generation, but at this point people still seem to be willing to pay for the convenience of not having to learn to use P2P and connecting their TV to their computer, and whatever other stuff we computer-literate people take for granted.

Maybe you don't even have a whole lot of it, just a few pages you've tied together.<br/><br/>Now, rather than make a whole big ass game, you make a microgame. A really little one, like a one-shot scenario, or a boardgame, or a commitee game or parlor LARP. And by micro, I mean really specific. This thing does just what it does for this particular situation. <br/><br/>Like, if you have a space setting and you want to do something about a smuggler ship running a blockade, just make this game about this specific ship ( <i>The Land o' MilknHoney</i>) running this specific blockade in this specific system with these specific problems and those specific enemy forces. Don't bother making it at all generic.<br/><br/>Later on, do a different game about some other aspect of the setting you find interesting, and make that microgame very specific as well. And keep doing that.

A person creates a strong web presence---maybe through a blog, or maybe just through forums---where they make an honest attempt to share their (general) knowledge and give advice. Also, if they want, they can share details about their works-in-progress and even develop it in the open. That all creates a sense of community, and I guess can be liken to pseudo-serialization.

Hit me in the noggin if I should take this to another thread or another site entirely.<br/><br/>Firstly, you and I seem to have a very different opinion about the overwhelmingly vast majority of fan-produced content.  Is there some utterly awesome material to be had?  Absolutely.  Is it worth sifting through the mountain of crap to find it?  Not in my world.<br/><br/>Another question: who will do the editing?  <br/><br/>Editing a novel is essential to producing a good product.  I can spot where an author has been poorly served by an editor, and I am in fact reading such a book now.  Editing is also thankless work: authors hate you, audiences don't know you exist.  Except for financial remuneration or assisting a friend, there is little reason to undertake the task (and assisting a friend runs a serious risk of ending said friendship.)  In a world where there is no pay for the product, one can assume there would be at best a token payment for the producer, and by extension the editor.  If there is no reason for people to learn the skills of the editor, and little demand for them, it seems that these skills would wither.  Except for odd masochists, the ancillary but essential individuals involved in creating good fiction will largely go missing.  Even among competent amateur writing, the end product will suffer, and the quality of this art in general will decline.<br/><br/>As for Sturgeon's Very Fine Revelation, I contend that if 90% of everything is crap, and my perusal of various DLC has led me to the conclusion that it is 99.99% crap (1 in 10,000 submissions being worth my time and attention) then there is a significantly higher incidence of crappiness in fan-sub material.  I may only have a 1-in-10 chance of picking up a good novel on a lark, but that's far better than grabbing a fan-sub at random, which will virtually never generate a positive result.<br/><br/>Or at least that's what my crystal ball is telling me.  I don't know how reliable that is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_235786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235786/#Comment_235786" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-05T14:52:12+00:00" title="October  5, 2009  2:52PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The key realization is that while we might be heading towards lean years in terms of artistic quality, that's something we have to tackle directly and with tools that fit the problem, not by trying to turn back the clock.<br/><br/>Personally, I expect that in a world without commercial copyrights quality will be upheld by various gatekeeping services that help people find the gems amidst the trash. We already have these services in their essential forms, they're just not so crucial yet. Effective art critique will become much more valuable when the role of the publisher is removed from the equation, for instance. So will the role of art history - instead of having the publisher tell you what you should be reading, you instead look at what smart people are recommending. In theory this should lead you to check out the exact same works, assuming that it's smart people who are making the publishing decisions right now.<br/><br/>Also, I see no reason why the professional artist wouldn't be respected and set aside the same way in the future as they are right now. If you don't want to risk reading a bad novel, then read just the stuff that's proven so successful that the artist has managed to leverage that quality into fame and fortune. There will still be ways of doing that, they'll just look different. Notably I don't see why and how editors would go anywhere; if they in fact are crucial to quality work, then anybody wanting to create quality work will still need an editor. I don't even believe that we're heading towards some sort of homogenous grassroots publishing chaos: critical functions will still be there and they'll still be important, so nobody has to wade in shit unless they want to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_235836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235836/#Comment_235836" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-06T03:01:36+00:00" title="October  6, 2009  3:01AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: King Turnip</cite>Firstly, you and I seem to have a very different opinion about the overwhelmingly vast majority of fan-produced content.

If it means "Making all of the income that you put towards necessities," then the second your car blows a tire or your hot water heater busts and you throw a little RPG cash towards fixing the crisis, that means the day job you work your butt off at is no longer how you "make your living." <br/><br/>I roll my eyes every time someone claims no one is "makes a living" off of doing RPGs. I'm a freelance photographer. I make most of my money that way. I don't carefully ensure that my game money goes towards fancy hats and chocolates and my photography money goes to my phone bill. I don't make $40K a year from roleplaying games, but there have been multiple occasions when a single PDF purchase at the end of a bad month made me sigh with relief and go "Holy fuck, I am so going to leave RIGHT NOW and buy $13 worth of groceries." Does that count?<br/><br/>I think the point, Jonathan, is that for some people it's not about finding the time to do a non-monetized hobby. It's about not having the liquidity to give stuff you work your butt off on away for free. I have to find every venue for monetizing my talents that I can, because I've got a crappy employment history and two kids. It'd be irresponsible to the people I take care of to turn down profit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236016/#Comment_236016" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-06T19:25:32+00:00" title="October  6, 2009  7:25PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Elizabeth, that does make sense, the pressure to monetize every aspect of your life that you can potentially get money from.

Like, I don't feel pressure to monetize, uh, my grocery shopping by picking up some groceries for senior citizens while I'm out.  That just doesn't occur to me as a viable way to make money because it's not a part of my everyday life. I do find it interesting that there are a lot of design cultures around the world where there's much less of an expectation of making significant income from indie game publishing. I guess I feel like that would work better for me, but I realize that I don't represent everyone and can't change the culture of the American indie scene on my own (nor would I necessarily want to).<br/><br/>My sense, I suppose, is that indie roleplaying publishing -- like a lot of publishing -- is in a transition phase from a model that's been pretty solid to something else that we haven't really figured out yet... most likely a number of different something else's.

Therefore it is more important to look for practical business models of the future, rather than try to convince pirates, who are just following where technology leads them, to stop doing what they're doing.

To me, the difference between doing other people's groceries and writing a game is creative. Writing is something I'm good at, as is photography. No one is "good at" grocery shopping. I went to college to learn to monetize my writing. I wasn't part of a culture that urged me to monetize my photography when I made the decision to start charging money for it, it was just the logical thing to do. <br/><br/>Do you also think it's fair to say "Man, the knitting scene was so much better before Etsy, when people were just doing it for the love?"<br/><br/>Also,  when I can count the number of people who have decided to stop publishing for money on one hand, even in this small of a hobby, that means "INDIE ROLEPLAYING PUBLISHING is transitioning away from anything" is a totally spurious statement. For good or bad, for every you or John or guy named Matt who decides to stop charging for the new games they write, there are two people (at least) who are happily charging what their game is worth. And some of those people are still heavy-hitters. Also, I notice that even for those who are "transitioning," PDFs of Agon and PTA and etc. are still available for purchase and not being given away.<br/><br/>It totally makes sense that you're excited about exploring other models, but it doesn't make sense that you're saying the indie community is all jumping on your bandwagon. I feel like there is a difference between a trend of less than ten designers in a group of a couple hundred indie game designers, which are part of a group of thousands of people who design and release games, and some kind of tectonic shift that will change the face of game publication as we know it. MAYBE eventually, 5-10 years down the line? But right now, you're a little early to the revolution.<br/><br/>Let me put it another way. If I had never met a single one of you crazy people and had somehow still managed to write It's Complicated, I would have published it for money via Lulu. It's not about being pressured. It's because I made a unique product that people would pay money for. If we had a rich tradition of free indie games, AND I knew that, I'd probably just try to get a job with one of the big game companies instead of writing stuff for free. I have a lot of passions and a lot of things I can do well. One of the reasons I spend my time on game design instead of on making jewelry, or cooking, or composing, or getting better with my Esperanto is <i>because</i> it is a thing I love that makes me money. I stopped selling jewelry designs because I made more money with game design. If game design stopped making me money, I'd probably let my projects languish with the promise of "getting to them someday" and go back to designing jewelry. For me it's not about indie posturing or pressure from the community (I've only been part of the community for what, a year and a half?) or being steeped in this poisonous culture. It's about doing something I love and getting paid for it. Monetizing artistic expression (aka "hobbies," at least for me) is how I pay my bills. That's how it was before I knew that writing indie RPGs was even a "thing," and that's (hopefully) how it'll be the day I die.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236062/#Comment_236062" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-07T06:44:53+00:00" title="October  7, 2009  6:44AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree.  There are a million ways to not make money.  If you're good at something, you love it, and someone <i>could</i> buy it, it's your duty to charge.<br/><br/>Lots of people possess art like an asset.  If I like a painting, or a book, or an indie game, I buy it, partly in debt to the artist, partly in the transferral ownership.  In other words, I want to support the artist, or his culture, so that more art will prosper.  And, I want ownership of the art, as a signifier of myself, as something I can recommend to others, etc., to stroke my own ego.<br/><br/>I have several paintings, books and indie games, all of which have been paid for.  I have no free indie games.  I have no interest in owning free indie games.  If I can't invest, whether as a playtester, a critical contributor, an editor or a consumer, I have no stakes in the product.  There's no personal infrastructure, no easy way to feel a part of the art.<br/><br/>That is not to say that everyone is like me.  But I have only one perspective.  As a consumer and a designer, I've got to support it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236066/#Comment_236066" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-07T07:29:17+00:00" title="October  7, 2009  7:29AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>I do find it interesting that there are a lot of design cultures around the world where there's much less of an expectation of making significant income from indie game publishing. </blockquote>\nThis makes perfect sense to me. Like you said, I can certainly understand the idea that, for a game designer, charging money for your games (your creative work) makes sense, and I'm happy to buy games I like. But partly this stems from the idea that games are something one makes and sells, rather than something one makes and shares.<br/><br/>I do understand some of the comments from game designers in this thread and in the "$1000" thread ... people who derive part of their income from selling games are naturally going to have a different perspective. <br/><br/>I have a lot of friends who make music, and most of them don't manage to make full-time jobs out of it. But the music that comes from small, independent scenes, where the assumption is that you will NOT "make a living" creating, sharing and performing music is where the best and most interesting music is found.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

I was trying to refer to a bunch of somewhat related trends in indie publishing, none of which necessarily have to do with releasing games for free.  I gave a better description of what I mean over in Graham's thread from a month ago:\n<blockquote>Also, though nobody I know is really talking about it in these terms yet, the existing indie methods of creating and publishing games have been under constant assault in the last several years, mainly from ourselves (old timers changing methods, swarms of new designers, new ideas about publishing like "ashcans" and free games, the volatile internet community, the rapidly transforming indie convention circuit, changes in distribution and retailing, Luke &amp; Jared working freelance, Evil Hat publishing games for indie designers, etc. etc.).</blockquote>\nI think previous models for publishing games commercially are still working, certainly. You can definitely still make a bunch of money with POD + GenCon + IPR, just like you could in 2005. But there are some shifts happening and it's not just crazy outliers but Ron and Vincent and Fred and etc.  And, in many ways, the "crazy free games" people or whatever are a part of those shifts and exploration of new business /publication models.  And that's in addition to format questions and issues regarding electronic distribution and prophecies about the end of print.<br/><br/>I do think we're coming from pretty different places regarding choosing game design as a place to put our energy and I respect that and apologize if I sounded like I was callously dismissing other perspectives.  For me, game design is very much like being in a band or doing graphic design or going out dancing or cooking, a form of creative expression that I engage in, but one that I've never really tried very hard to monetize.  Which makes me bad at being a "game designer" in the traditional sense, even though I churn out a ridiculous amount of short free games, partially finished stuff, and material that I use in play.  So I guess certain emerging publishing strategies fit better with what I'm already doing than some of the models that have been popular before.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236285/#Comment_236285" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-08T04:50:52+00:00" title="October  8, 2009  4:50AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that makes total sense. Sorry if I came off like a grumpus, I just felt like you were speaking for both of us and I was uncomfortable with that. But I understand what you're talking about now.<br/><br/>I do think that some of the newer ideas for how to monetize and distribute games (the unstore!) are pretty exciting. And even though I keep forgetting to actually do anything with free games, I'm more than a little interested in what old hats who used to sell games and do well are now doing with the free stuff they've been dabbling in. I also think there's a big difference between being a good game designer and a good marketer-- there are games on IPR's top ten of all time you couldn't pay me to play. All that being a good game designer means is that you design games well. Being a <i>successful</i> game designer is a lot more subjective, I suppose.<br/><br/>Also, don't you occasionally charge for your graphic design services? Or is my brain just making that up because I haven't caffeinated yet?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236320/#Comment_236320" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-08T08:44:19+00:00" title="October  8, 2009  8:44AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sometimes people insist on paying me, but, no, I generally don't charge very much / anything.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
