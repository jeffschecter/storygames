Now, I really liked Primitive the first time I read it (and still do!), but I recently reread the game in hopes of playing it sometime soon and I came to a realization - the text doesn't give me any idea how to act as GM. <br/><br/>Unless I'm missing pages or something (which would be a problem of its own), there is no information on how the GM takes actions for her NPCs (be they dinosaurs, other cavemen, or whatever). I understand how they get placed on the initiative queue, but the text never goes on to say how that vicious crocodile in the picture and example takes actions against the characters. Does the crocodile (and other NPCs) have its own aspects to roll against, or do the players roll their own savagery to dodge its nasty bite, with a failure indicating they get wounded? I'd lean toward the latter for simplicity's sake (avoiding giving aspects to everything), but the text doesn't tell me. <br/><br/>Also, how many wounds should a giant crocodile have? Characters start with 4, so should the croc have 6? 8? What about a T-Rex? Characters always deliver 1 wound on a successful combat action - can a croc or T-Rex deliver more than that in one bite?<br/><br/>There's no guidance on how a GM should prepare an adventure, which is perhaps excusable given that the game seems to have a traditional GM role and adventure prep would likewise be traditional. Having a sample adventure up on your Web site would be another option, to give us an idea how you see one looking. <br/><br/>Again, I really like the game's simple system and communication element, but the current text doesn't help me turn that enthusiasm into an entertaining game without some guesswork. Filling in those gaps would likely result in more actual play and better sales.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr" title="Kevin Allen Jr"><img alt="Kevin Allen Jr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr">Kevin Allen Jr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66106/#Comment_66106" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-30T07:36:54+00:00" title="April 30, 2007  7:36AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great questions Eric. <br/><br/>Its an interesting critique, that there isn't a lot of GM support. I did a lot of assuming in the text (formost i didn't define any terms like NPC, GM, d6 or other cross platform terms that gamers use). One of the first things i say in the book is that this isn't a game for beginners in spite of being simple. The GM does have a very traditional role (write up some NPCs, pen a few encounters, adjudicate rules, really "run" the adventures) but i'm not sure that i come right out an explicitly say that (i'll check the book today after work). There aren't any secrets, or great bits of wisdom to empart, or at least there isn't any that is specific to the game (see all of Sons of Kryos for general wisdom). There are no special rules or any of that, you play the GM like a guy with a lot of PC in his charge, and the authority to world-build.<br/><br/>Its funny, the thing i think most RPG texts lack is adequet GM support. <br/><br/>NPCs work the same way PCs do. They have the same two aspects (civility and savagry), a number of Qualities and wounds. Because combat is so abstract no matter if its a velociraptor claw/claw/biting you or some pudunk caveman trying to punch you out, a sucsessful attack only does one wound. The NPC can add Qualities to suit the situation, and uses aspects to add/subtract the rolls the same way PCs do. NPCs can have as many wounds as you want, depending on size, toughness or just how long you want the thing to be in a fight.<br/><br/>Here are some whipped up stats for that giant croc:<br/>Civility- 0 (animals for the most part would have a 0 civility)<br/>Savagry- 8 (NPCs can go over the normal caveman aspect limit, but i wouldn't go more than 10)<br/>Wounds- 7<br/>Qualities:<br/>I have hide like stone<br/>I can slap you with my immense tail<br/>I know where the muddy river can hide me<br/>I will swallow you whole<br/>I will grind you in my jaws<br/><br/>Yeah, the GM should treat the adventure just like D&amp;D modual writing<br/><br/>At this year's GenCon i'm releasing a suppliment for primitive called "Record of Threats" that talks a lot about the things your questioning here. Its a book of NPCs (dinosaurs, monsters, lava people), items, a few adventure starters, and some other tidbits. I hadn't anticipated the original text NEEDING more GM support, but i wanted to provide a supliment with more color, some setting options, just a big grab bag of ideas really. I think i'll add to it a bit more discussion on how to RUN the game. Record of Threats will be the exact same size as Primitive (as it's printed the same way) and will cost only $4.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66126/#Comment_66126" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-30T08:27:54+00:00" title="April 30, 2007  8:27AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Kevin, I'm comfortable just making that shit up,  but in the spirit of the New Honesty, and in retrospect, do you think it was a mistake not to include whatever you are putting Record of Threats in the original game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr" title="Kevin Allen Jr"><img alt="Kevin Allen Jr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr">Kevin Allen Jr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66132/#Comment_66132" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-30T08:54:27+00:00" title="April 30, 2007  8:54AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It was probably a mistake not to include a paragraph or two saying "Being a GM is just like in other games, the rules don't change, adventures work just like you think they should."  But i didn't think of it and that need didn't come out in playtest, i guess because my playtesters filled in the blanks. But i'm pretty big on the notion there shouldn't be blanks. It would have been really easy to include one more little section telling you some GM technique, there was even room for it in the book, it just didn't really occur to me. And thats a bummer.<br/><br/>I don't think its a big problem, though. Record of Threats isn't a patch, its a suppliment in the truest sense of the word, it's extras, it's gravy, it doesn't have any new rules in it, just new applications of the existing rules (why can't an object have qualities, or a scene?). I see this new book as a collection of ideas i've had after the fact, about how to add flavors I personally have thought of to your games. <br/><br/>Mistake, probably<br/>oversight, definitly<br/>problem, not really.<br/>am i kicking myself for not sticking the dismount? You bet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66136/#Comment_66136" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-30T08:57:21+00:00" title="April 30, 2007  8:57AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know the feeling, man!

I agree that the game as it stands doesn't need a large number of statted-out creatures and lengthy GM guidelines - that simplicity is a reason I like it. <br/><br/>But an example or two (like the croc above) would have gone a long way to helping a GM get started in making creatures of her own. Again, I don't see anything in the current text that clearly states that NPCs all have Civility and Savagery aspects that they roll against. I can make that inference, sure, but having confirmation now makes me feel more confident in running the game.<br/><br/>Thanks for the clarifications. It's great to hear you've been thinking further about the game and will have some extra stuff for its fans.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
