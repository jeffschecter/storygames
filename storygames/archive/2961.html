And if Ben Lehman isn't around these parts, and someone wants to give him a heads-up, that'd be great. <br/><br/>First, the preface: I'm not trying to be argumentative just to stir up trouble. I'm mostly trying to clarify my own understanding of GNS, because i thought i had it down, and yet i keep running into things from people that i thought understood it themselves, which completely undermines my supposed understanding. Secondarily, i'm sorta defending Robin Laws player types, but that's really a minor point along the way.<br/><br/>Anyway, while looking for something, i stumbled onto <a href="http://benlehman.blogspot.com/2005/08/i-break-robins-laws.html" rel="nofollow">Ben's post about Robin's Laws' player types</a>. OK, sure, he kinda tests off the scale, so to speak. But i'm not sure that indicates a fundamental problem with the categories--some people are gonna want all those things. I've played with plenty of RPers who <b>don't</b> want all those things, however--frex, my own result looks like Method Actor 100%/Storyteller 83%/Specialist 75%/Tactition 67%/Power Gamer 42%/Butt-kicker 8%/Casual Gamer 8%. I'd actually quibble that the quiz doesn't actually represent me accurately--Specialist should be much lower, unless you broaden the definition of a "specialty" to "characters that have complex multi-dimensional personalities, and tend to get their way through means other than physical force"; and i'd say Power Gamer should be somewhat lower. But, I'm willing to, for sake of argument, say that the quiz gives a reasonable snapshot, and i'm just not willing to admit my Specialist and Power Gamer tendencies. So, we'll assume that *is* an accurate representation of my desires when RPing. Had my gaming group take the quiz a couple weeks ago, and most of the results looked something like 90%/75%/50%/50%/10%/10% (with which ones those were varying from person to person). So, IME, most RPers actually do lean one way or the other.<br/><br/>But, and here's the real point of my post: the various responses to Ben's blog post confused me, because they seemed to be exactly contrary to my understanding of the Big Model. I got the impression that those who understand GNS (Ben, Ron, others) were saying that (1) GNS priorities are not meant to be in conflict--that is, that you can 100% fulfill all three of the creative agendas simultaneously; and (2) that GNS creative agendas are different from Robin Laws' player types in that people tend to strongly prefer one over the others, rather than wanting all those things.<br/><br/>Now, the latter statement meshes well with my understanding of GNS from other contexts. Though the notion that either at any given moment or over the long haul (i'm honestly not sure which one the Big Model claims) the 3 creative agendas are in conflict doesn't at all match my experiences--i find that the three can often feet into each other--you can simultaneously be fulfilling, say, narrativist and gamist priorities, and neither is subordinate or secondary to the other.<br/><br/>But the first point is exactly counter to my understanding. I thought that one of the fundamental premises of the Big Model was that hte creative agendas were in opposition, at least in the sense that people either (a) must or (b) tend to [i'm not sure which] subordinate the other two to whichever one they were favoring at the moment. So, where'd i get this wrong?<br/><br/>And, as an aside, if the fact that Robin Laws' player types are "things that almost anyone wants out of any gaming session"  [quoting Ben] somehow "breaks" them as a useful categorization system, i don't see how that criticism doesn't apply to the creative agendas. My experience is that the Big Model's creative agendas are things that almost anyone wants out of any gaming session (if in varying degrees). I've met a lot more people who wouldn't mind if one or more of the aspects represented by Laws' types was completely absent from a game, than those who wouldn't mind if one or more of the creative agendas was unfulfillable in a game. [Specifically, i might be content with an RPG that pretty much made Gamist play impossible, but i'm the only person i've met like that, and i haven't met any people who are happy if Narrativist and/or Simulationist play aren't supported.]<br/><br/>Hmmm...did i make sense? Can anybody clarify for me?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67086/#Comment_67086" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-07T07:04:06+00:00" title="May  7, 2007  7:04AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, funny, I see this thread title and go "Huh, didn't I like, have that discussion years ago?"  :-)<br/><br/>Robin's Laws are presented as a theory of player types.  "Some players want X, some players want Y"  I think that they're a flawed theory of player types, because they don't really "type" well.  It's possible to want all of these things, not just some of them, provided that by doing these things you actually are doing a fun activity and not a boring one.  In other words, I think that they're a function of past system experience and not nearly as much personal preference.<br/><br/><i>(1) GNS priorities are not meant to be in conflict--that is, that you can 100% fulfill all three of the creative agendas simultaneously</i><br/><br/>This is wrong.<br/><br/>GNS, as it has turned out, <i>also</i> isn't actually very good as a theory of player types.

As in, they represent various sets of preferences that "pierce" down through all the layers of the Model, like a system kabob.<br/><br/>We could break them down to something like:<br/><br/><b>Specialist</b>\n<ul><li>Social Contract: The player won't be ostracized for playing a ninja... AGAIN.</li>\n<li>Exploration: The Situation involves a Setting with opportunities for sneaky "ninja" Character to exist. System provides options for doing stereotypically ninja stuff. Color emphasizes how ninja guy is uber-badass.</li>\n<li>Techniques: Some mechanics for playing out the various stealthy combat, ninja magic, whatever, stuff would probably be good.</li>\n<li>Ephemera: Screen Time must be given to allow the player to shine as "the ninja".</li></ul>\nNote how none of those things really maps to GNS. It seems quite likely that our Specialist would enjoy a Simulationist game where he can Explore various facets of being a ninja. However, it's also quite possible he would also enjoy a Gamist game where he throws down with the power of his elite ninja skill suite, or a Narrativist game which lets him tell a story which happens to involve a ninja dude. All of these might satisfy his appetite for ninja, but none of these games would be even remotely the same. And, it's even quite possible he'd enjoy one or two of these and find the other(s) boring, despite being ninja to the max. So crap... this means you could get three ninja Specialist players together, and they might <i>still</i> expect different things from their gaming.<br/><br/>And, as Ben points out, the GNS Creative Agendas describe play types, not player types. So, comparing GNS and Skewers is basically an apples to oranges comparison, but hopefully the above example demonstrates how GNS is more useful than Skewers in defining which shared activity everyone is participating in.<br/><br/>Also, what Ben said about past experiences. <i>This is especially true</i> for Laws' Specialist skewer.<br/><br/>Oh yeah... have you read <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=15234.msg163928" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> from April 2005?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67427">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anemone" title="Anemone"><img alt="Anemone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.tlucretius.net/temp/anemone_icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anemone">Anemone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67427/#Comment_67427" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-07T15:53:46+00:00" title="May  7, 2007  3:53PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Larry</cite><br/>And, as Ben points out, the GNS Creative Agendas describe play types, not player types.

I don't see it.  Because Ninja Norm will probably enjoy "S", "G", or "N" play, and even more, a mix of those, as long as he gets to play a ninja.  If you tell me Norm is largely a specialist who likes to play ninja, I can run \u2014 or design, if I'm designing for a single group \u2014 whatever I want as long as he gets to play a ninja and look good doing it.  But whatever G, N, S, X, Y or Z I throw in, no ninja = no happy Norm.  So I have a much easier time using simple player types when I'm planning than "creative agendas."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67454/#Comment_67454" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-07T19:19:17+00:00" title="May  7, 2007  7:19PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sophie: Briefly and inexactly - Laws types (and other skewers) relate to what one individual player does.

This isn't just some arbitrary declaration handed down from on high. It comes out of a lot of observation of how games are actually played, and a lot of failed attempts to create functional hybrids ("<a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=1072.0" rel="nofollow">El Dorado</a>"). Basically the observation is, in games where everyone is having fun, one of the three creative agendas is at work. Where there is no shared preference*, gameplay starts to get incoherent, with dissatisfied players behaving in subtle or non-subtle ways to sabotage the game.<br/><br/>* Note by "shared preference," I don't necessarily mean that everyone sits down and explicitly declares, "We're playing Gamist!" If everyone is playing according to the same creative agenda, by whatever means of agreement, (including dumb luck, or becoming dissatisfied with successive play groups until finding one that understands the "right" way to role-play) then they share a preference.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67557/#Comment_67557" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-08T09:32:15+00:00" title="May  8, 2007  9:32AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nat --<br/><br/>This is totally the wrong place to have this sort of discussion (oh, boy, is it ever.)<br/><br/>If you're actually interested in the answers to your questions, shoot me an e-mail at taogames@gmail.com<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67575/#Comment_67575" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-08T11:27:45+00:00" title="May  8, 2007 11:27AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ben is probably right. But at the risk of discussing this in the wrong place, Larry has the right of the theory for the most part. The observation is, however, that where there's no shared agenda, problems <i>tend</i> to occur. Not automatically occur. It's arguable that most problems in play occur at the social level. But, from a design perspective this isn't something that the designer can handle (as JD dilligently reminds us). It would seem that problems with differences in Creative Agenda, are, therefore the one biggest problem area that a designer can attack.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the theory argues that, if you want to help people avoid those problems, design systems that support a clear Creative Agenda such that it's more likely that all players are on the same sheet of music with regards to this, and that these problems will occur less often.<br/>\n<br/>\nAssuming that's a set of problems that you wish to address. Should you feel like Marco does that it's a non-issue in most cases, or that players can and should work it out for themselves, then you have to look elsewhere in the big theory for help than the Creative Agenda layer.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaws is not incorrect about the categorizations, nor do I think Ben is saying he is. There is potentially some value in terms of defining whether or not somebody in your group is a member of some category. Is it as much value as trying to ensure a stable Creative Agenda? Is pandering to various types if it destroys a shared Creative Agenda a good idea?<br/>\n<br/>\nHard to say, it's going to come down to the specifics of the group. My experiences would tend to confirm Ben's suspicions, but then I have much the same bias he does. For the individual GM out there... I dunno, you'll just have to try both ways, and see what works better for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can tell you which is easier, however. Laws is basically telling you to put a lot of effort into discovering the player types in question, and then figuring out how to deliver what they're looking for individually (even gives advice on pacing between these things and such, IIRC). If you're promoting a single creative agenda, then it's far simpler. You just use the same set of techniques and such for everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat's interesting is that, IMO, though all modes of play cannot happen at the same time, that's not the same as saying that a group that plays in a Gamism fashion cannot enjoy playing in a Narrativism fashion. In fact, it's my opinion that where people have distinct preferences about this, it often indicates that they've had to deal with incoherent games where these priorities conflicted. So they come to hate the one that ruined the sort of fun they had at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis explains many "Narrativists" (if you will), in that they tried for ages with games like D&amp;D; or COC to be able to create story as players, but were run down by players who were naturally playing to the systems provided (which don't support narrativism). So they become very anti-"Roll Players."<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next day you'll see the same person enjoying a game of Jungle Speed, however. It's not that they don't enjoy the competition and such of Gamism than that their afeared of it being in games where they're after something else. I think that pretty much all modes are enjoyable by anyone. It might not be what you're used to in terms of RPGs, but that doesn't mean it's not fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point being that if you "force" people to play by one agenda, they all have fun. I use "force" facetiously here, because it's really all about setting up reward systems and such that promote the sort of play in question. But you definitely can take steps to bring a game into one mode or another for the entire group.<br/>\n<br/>\nStarting with a system that promotes a coherent CA in play.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67594/#Comment_67594" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-08T12:24:55+00:00" title="May  8, 2007 12:24PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite><br>This is totally the wrong place to have this sort of discussion (oh, boy, is it ever.)</br></blockquote>\n<i>Is there</i> a right place to have this sort of discussion, and if so, could someone please point me to it?

At least, I don't understand what GNS has now become as part of the Big Model. So I won't try to discuss GNS as such in this post.<br><br>But the first big thing that hit me when I read <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/articles/1/" rel="nofollow">Ron Edward's original essay</a> was that different desires/priorities/needs can conflict - that some ways that people want to play will inevitably conflict with other ways. I can't overstate the importance of this enough - it was instrumental in getting me back into rolegames after a five-year hiatus.<br><br>For example, and avoiding GNS terms, a player who wants to face a mechanical challenge in terms of the rules will be stymied and frustrated by illusionism, or by player-GM negotiation aimed at developing "the story". When either of those phenomena appears, your mechanical competence (and guts and luck) are irrelevant. By contrast, players who just want to sit back and take a passive role in the GMs story will only be frustrated if other players try to take active control game of events, because the GM will have to struggle to bring them back to a predetermined plot. I've heard this particularly in the context of "GM as auteur" mode (related to Scandinavian LARP?).<br><br>A player who wants the vicarious experience of adventure ("like you were there") will be distracted by the insistence that they develop and act out a distinctive character. Some players really enjoy acting different characters (Laws' "method actor"), and will achieve optimal enjoyment only when everyone else is doing this. (For example, part of this is self-consciousness - it's embarassing to adopt a theatrical voice or mannerisms when everyone else is talking normally)<br><br>Similarly, if you're really into character immersion (feeling and experiencing what your character would be feeling and experiencing) you place a lot of demands on the GM and other players. For an optimal experience, metagame and irrelevant chatter needs to be eliminated ("if you say it, your character says it"), and intrusion by the rules needs to be minimised (e.g. by having the GM perform all application of them, all the die rolling etc).<br><br>The need for verisimilitude and 'realism' is another bone of contention - some players demand a lot of it to remain engaged, but this places onerous demands on the GM (and often the players as well, e.g. in terms of "plausible behaviour of an upper-class woman in 1890s England"). If your primary concerns are elsewhere (character acting, meeting a challenge, immersing in your character, creating a compelling story, annoying the other players by throwing dice...) and you don't need this high level of "realism" then this is at best a distraction and indeed may be actively destructive (e.g. when your character's grand speech is interrupted by another player pointing out that the Americas haven't been discovered yet).<br><br>So this "exclusivity" isn't something that's unique to GNS (or, indeed, rolegames at all) - when you move the focus to the whole-group level you can see how pretty much any pair of player priorities can confict.<br><br>If anything, it seems to me that the emphasis on exclusivity in the discussion of GNS are more do with the priorities of Ron and the others at the Forge than anything else. The idea is that the focus on the whole group allows you to (potentially) achieve a synchronisation of priorities and desires that's leads to really excellent play. I haven't read Robin's Laws, but from Mike's description above:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>figuring out how to deliver what they're looking for individually</blockquote>\nit sounds like he's talking about achieving *acceptable* function via a spirit of compromise. The vibe at the Forge, meanwhile, has always been one of shooting for excellent play, and for pushing the boundaries of what's possible in gaming.<br><br>(An example of this "pushing for excellence" is the frequent rejection of the mantra that "bad gaming is better than no gaming" and the apparent willingness to exclude people from gaming groups if they can't pull their weight. I'm guessing that Laws is trying to help people accomodate an fixed gaming group as best they can.)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_69076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/woodelf" title="woodelf"><img alt="woodelf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/woodelf">woodelf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69076/#Comment_69076" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-14T18:16:42+00:00" title="May 14, 2007  6:16PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry for the delay in continuing the discussion. Real life intervened, plus, i wasn't sure what to say. Then it hit me a couple days ago:<br><br>At least part of the reason i'm hung up on this is that, as others have identified, the two theories are applicable in different situations. I don't need a theory of any sort to tell me that my group has conflicting priorities. But a theory might tell me what to do about it. And that's where the Big Model falls down, for me: it says [paraphrasing] "conflicting priorities tend to lead to problems; the solution is to eliminate the conflicting priorities", whether through the players agreeing to play differently, or finding different players. This is, IME, not helpful. That is, step 1 for me has always been "i want to game with these people" and everything else comes after that. And, if the players are capable of/willing to change play styles, they'll do so--again, without any need for theoretical explanations. So, an theroy that is entirely predicated on the route to good play being synchronicity of goals just doesn't match any circumstance i've ever been in.<br/><br/>And I've experienced really awesome, excellent play. Without synchonized player preferences--at least not along the lines of the categories that the Big Model, the Threefold, or Robin's Laws propose. So i know it's possible to get there. Which is why Robins' Laws' model is such an appealing categorization system: it starts from the same premise (that there are different types of playing out there), but suggests the solution to poor play is to work with the types you have, rather than eliminate the conflicts outright through homogeneity.<br/><br/>To be clear, i'm not saying that i wouldn't have even yet more fun with a homogeneous group--though i doubt that homogeneity of Big Model creative agendas would do the trick, since what i want out of a Narrativist/theme-driven game is directly at odds with what most people seem to want (based on the published games)--i'm just saying that, at the moment, that's a non-option, so I need help with how to improve play within a heterogeneous group. <br/><br/>Oh, and what i've been having i wouldn't describe as "bad play"--i've experienced that before, and, yes, no gaming <b>was</b> better, so i didn't game for a while, until i could find others. It's merely "ok play", and i want "awesome play". And, to the degree that you can judge these things by actual play transcripts, i've had fun heterogeneous-group play that was every bit as awesome as the homogeneous-group play that others are having. So, no, i don't think Robin's Laws is about merely achieving "acceptable" function via compromise--I think it's about getting awesome play via compromise (and, thus, is implicitly in conflict with the Big Model, which seems to say that homogeneous play can achieve a degree of excellence that heterogeneous play can't.)                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69084/#Comment_69084" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-14T18:55:02+00:00" title="May 14, 2007  6:55PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: woodelf</cite>And that's where the Big Model falls down, for me: it says [paraphrasing] "conflicting priorities tend to lead to problems; the solution is to eliminate the conflicting priorities", whether through the players agreeing to play differently, or finding different players.

We're not doing a great job of serving that need yet.<br/><br/>But even people who are "capable of/willing to change play styles" can't or won't do it until they know there's a better alternative. Theory can help with that a little, but I think you've intuited that you can't just start talking theory with people and expect them to be anything but insulted.<br/><br/>On the other hand, though... you can't always get what you want. Some groups really are better served by enjoying each other's company through different leisure activities.<br/><br/>I am gonna go ahead and recommend that you go ahead and maybe make an Actual Play post at the Forge and specify that you consider your play pretty satisfactory but would like to make it even better.

'Cause all of them that i've looked at seem to be pretty heavily hybridized with Gamist agenda--leastways, i know when i try and play them, i keep finding my desire to pursue themes and meaning and structure running up against rules that demand i give them tactical considerations. Universalis comes the closest to being purely-Narrativist, IMHO, but at the cost of really stepping outside of roleplaying in favor of storytelling--that is, it seems to demand too much metagame thinking to allow me, at least ,to really be in character, which is a large part of the appeal of RPGs for me.<br/><br/>Dust Devils looked promising, but it's too fatalist for my group--again, running up against the desire to be a character, and in this case, to be a character that can succeed. So, while real life has caused the game to be cut short, preliminary experiences (3 sessions) lead me to conclude that it's not gonna work for them, but the fatalism is a strong enough element that i can't really conclude whether Narrativism can work for this group or not.<br/><br/>[and i realize this could come across as snarky--it's really not meant to be. Based on the abstract descriptions of the CAs, I should be a pure-blooded Narrativist. Yet all the games that are trumpeted as "Narrativist" look to me like heavily-Gamist games, that just happen to have theme as one of the currencies. At least I think that explains  why the CA appeals to me, and yet the games don't.

I think Polaris is a pretty good one. The resolution system uses "key phrases" to negotiate about the events of the story, like I could follow-up something you narrated with "But only if..." and add some kind of exception to it, or I could ask you to give me an alternative to the last thing you said and then I pick one or the other; a single die roll is a last-resort decision-maker. There are a few resources that you use for certain things in conflicts, but they're less involved than, say, the tokens in Universalis. It's a very light, "pure," freeform-ish engine.<br/><br/>Polaris is a game about tragic failure, though. So I'm not sure whether your group will dig that. It has a lot of nifty an untraditional features, and is one of the most story-like "story games," in the sense that what you're creating is pretty unambiguously a legend rather than a world. I encourage you to read more about it and see if it appeals to you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69132/#Comment_69132" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-15T06:05:01+00:00" title="May 15, 2007  6:05AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: woodelf</cite>You got a suggestion for a game with a clearly-Narrativist agenda?</blockquote>\n<i>Dogs, Polaris, The Mountain Witch, PTA, Hero's Banner</i>...<br/><br/><a href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.indiepressrevolution.com</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_69141">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/markv" title="markv"><img alt="markv" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/markv">markv</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69141/#Comment_69141" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-15T06:46:04+00:00" title="May 15, 2007  6:46AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rob Alexander</cite>So this "exclusivity" isn't something that's unique to GNS (or, indeed, rolegames at all) - when you move the focus to the whole-group level you can see how pretty much any pair of player priorities can confict.</blockquote>\nagreed: I've only played with one or two people whose preferences I would immediately label with GNorS but I've run across a bunch who had strong priorities in the areas you list.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69143">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/woodelf" title="woodelf"><img alt="woodelf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/woodelf">woodelf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69143/#Comment_69143" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-15T06:47:59+00:00" title="May 15, 2007  6:47AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buzz</cite><cite>Posted By: woodelf</cite>You got a suggestion for a game with a clearly-Narrativist agenda?</blockquote>\n<i>Dogs, Polaris, The Mountain Witch, PTA, Hero's Banner</i>...<br/><br/><a href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.indiepressrevolution.com</a><br/><br/>DitV is very Gamist, IMHO--it's got this complicated dice mechanism with tons of resource management and strategizing built into even the simplest conflict. That's exactly what i'm trying to avoid. Primetime Adventures is the same way, though less intensely. I'm not saying that either of those games isn't Narrativist, to be clear--i just think that, by the definitions of the Big Model, they're about equally both. I want a game where the person who's good at it--or good at numbers and resource management and gaming the system--will have little to no advantage over the person who can't figure out the probabilities when flipping a coin. IOW, probably a lousy game, when judged as a game. Where the dominant impact on play will be either character capabilities or player creativity/storytelling ability. Not game-playing ability.<br/><br/>Polaris is on the shelf, half-read. I'll have to finish reading it. Though, as Alex pointed out, probably won't sell with this group--they love success, and at best tolerate heroic sacrifice--nevermind tragic failure. Doesn't Hero's Banner have the same general arc (i.e., how will you fail tragically, not will you fail tragically)? I gotta confess, a completely skipped getting to know that one, because the author's sell completely turned me off--i started to check it out, and then he described a game that seemed like the antithesis of what i might enjoy: lots of mechanics for the parts i like to leave open, no mechanics for the parts i want the game to handle. But I might've misjudged it. The Mountain Witch sounds like absolutely awesome mechanics, but i'm highly resistant to games built around what is in essence "one story". Seems like replay value would be pretty limited. But unless someone lifts the mechanics and builds a "normal" open-ended RPG out of them, i may have to break down and buy it, just to find out what this "trust mechanic" thing is that everyone keeps talking about, and why it's so cool.<br/><br/>I'm not completely unversed in Forge-derived games, nor indie games. I've got a significant fraction of the IPR catalog on my shelves (if you exclude D20 System stuff, probably about half), though some of it is yet unread, and a good number of other indie games (both Forge-y and otherwise). So I'm not coming at this from ignorance, but rather from a different POV--what a lot of people call "pure Narrativst" i call "hybrid Narrativist/Gamist"--my tolerance for Gamist elements in RPGs is just way lower than most people's, i think. If you prefer to think of it that way, you could simply take it that PTA or Hero Quest is "too crunchy" for me (though that's an imprecise description).<br/><br/>Actually, come to think of it, 1001 Nights looked promising in this regard, on a skim. I'll have to give it a proper read.<br/>I should also reread Trollbabe, Mortal Coil, Cat, Story Engine, and some of the Matrix games--I have recollections of all of them being along those lines, especially Trollbabe. Hmmm...don't remember much of any way to game the system in Trollbabe--that might be just the ticket, at least for a one-off.<br/><br/>Others that I haven't had a chance to read, but bought based on recommendation or review or whatever, and so might possibly fit the bill: Faery's Tale, Legends of Alyria, Swansong (um, tragic endings again, though, right?), Perfect. Anybody think one of those might be a bit more what i'm looking for (just to direct my reading, 'cause i'm a very slow reader)?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_69156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69156/#Comment_69156" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-15T07:20:32+00:00" title="May 15, 2007  7:20AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: woodelf</cite>DitV is very Gamist, IMHO--it's got this complicated dice mechanism with tons of resource management and strategizing built into even the simplest conflict.

The players simply have their characters stick together and jump into every conflict together and 9 times out of 10 they can simply pile on more dice than the GM and win through attrition.  That is pretty unsatisfying to someone looking for tactical challenge.<br/><br/>However, the mechanics work for a Narrativist style game because while the players can win, doing so will generally cost them something.  Sometimes more than they are willing to pay, if they are worried about such things as addressing theme.  There are lots of threads on this in the Lumpley forums on The Forge.<br/><br/>Did I just derail this thread?  If so, the original poster can slap me.  If someone wants to discuss DitV or similar games in the context of supporting different CA's, I'd be happy to have that conversation in another thread if it doesn't belon here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69193/#Comment_69193" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-15T09:11:42+00:00" title="May 15, 2007  9:11AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my analysis, Robin Laws player types are advice to help the GM make everyone at the table happy. It assumes that 1) the GM is responsible for satisfying player needs at the table, and 2) this can be done by figuring out what the player wants to do and giving it to them. I've read it. I've used it. It's good advice.<br/><br/>It totally ignores the fact that it's often hard to give Bob what he wants and give Mary what she wants at the same time. You might have Bob's character doing all kinds of cool skill things while Mary sits and watches, bored out of her mind. Then you switch to Mary and let her do her backstory thing and Bob's eyes start to glaze over. The advice people normally give is to switch faster. It works some of the time.<br/><br/>The other way to tackle the problem is to make sure everyone wants the same thing coming into the game. It's pretty much one of those 'yeah, duh' statements. If you all are invested in reinforcing the integrity of some part (system, setting, characters, etc.) of the game, you are less likely to need fast-switching and player-focused content. It's more likely that all of the content is interesting to every player. If you are all invested in getting to some kind of point during play, then you're all more likely to be focused on the same things and have a good time. If you all are there for some friendly competition and to show what you can do within the game, as long as you're doing that, you'll all get a good vibe off the other players even when your character isn't involved. When players come to the table with different preferences, though -- one guy showing off his game skillz, another trying to make a point, and two more jazzing on the essence of the setting or their characters -- the game has a larger chance of boring folks as they sit through stuff they just don't care about.<br/><br/>So the GNS stuff -- really, Creative Agenda -- says that we'll all get along better if we all have a shared priority. The theory in application says: Don't sneak up on it. Talk about it. Make sure everyone is on the same page. Maybe even play a game that helps you be on the same page and gives you tools dedicated to your priorities. <br/><br/>Robin Laws' advice embraces the differences as an unavoidable consequence of people just being different. So the practical application of the Laws theory is to switch rapidly and give players different things. I think this creates more of a burden on the GM, since one must prepare more material. It also fails to address the fact that Mary might not be interested in 75% of the game content, even if the focus on her 25% of the time comes for a minute every four minutes. <br/><br/>Alright, now I get a bit jargony, because woodelf asked some questions about the theory. Stop and ask me if you need me to explain what I mean by a term and I'll do my best to clarify. I've seen you as woodelf for a long time, I think, so calling you Nat seems odd -- have a preference?<br/><br/>Determining a player's Creative Agenda (G-N-S preference) usually requires seeing a whole lot of play. It's very difficult to look at a minute or two of play and go, 'oh, they liked rolling dice and playing the little poker dice game in Dogs, so they must be Gamist.' You pretty much need to see a complete chunk of play -- "complete" requiring a large cycle of play that usually includes the rewards of play, too, so you know what the player is getting out of it. If you play Dogs for a while, you see that the tactical dice game is fun and all, but it's hardly the point of the game. It's just a tool that lets you keep raising the stakes for your character (and you). The stakes aren't a gambling thing as much as a moral thing. Looking at a complete cycle of play, you can see that Dogs players make some pretty serious decisions and often make a point, intentionally or not, about what they feel is right. That's pretty Narrativist.<br/><br/>Plus what Andrew said, cuz he's spot on.<br/><br/>Basically, don't mistake the tools for the process. Dice-rolling and bits of system are not a Creative Agenda.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_69200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69200/#Comment_69200" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-15T09:27:12+00:00" title="May 15, 2007  9:27AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>Robin Laws' advice embraces the differences as an unavoidable consequence of people just being different.

With one group, it is often blatantly obvious that only one half of the table can be satisfied at any given moment. Given these moments will often last for four hours, you get a lot of bored, distracted players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69230/#Comment_69230" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-15T10:17:23+00:00" title="May 15, 2007 10:17AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: woodelf</cite>DitV is very Gamist, IMHO--it's got this complicated dice mechanism with tons of resource management and strategizing built into even the simplest conflict.

Which Dogs in the Vineyard only sort of does. Thus Endeth The Jargony Moment, thank god that's over.<br/><br/>Back to player types: are there any sources or forums where people have developed further elaborations on Laws' schema? I'd be particularly interested to hear if anyone's approached in any kind of rigorous way the question of whether certain sets of types have a strong tendency to go together. I suspect, though, that nobody's really done much questioning of these types, and either reject the whole concept or just take it at face value.

Huh? That aside, it may be more an artifact of my group than of the game--i know that when we played it, ther ewas a lot of "what should i do that'll give me the biggestt mechanical advantage" going on with the players, but i concur that, on paper, it looks pretty, um, i don't even know how to say it...um, non-gamist-supporting? See, i don't just want a game that's Narrativist-supporting, i want one that's <i>not</i> Gamist-supporting, 'cause i've got at least one player that'll just fall into that playstyle, reflexively, if he can. But, yeah, we may have to give it another try, if i can persuade them that the initial bad experience was an artifact of unfamiliarity, and not the game [being incompatible with our preferences].<br/><br/>As to DitV, i've yet to get a chance to play it, so i'm going on the combination of having read it (twice+) and reading others reports about playing it, including actual play transcripts. The actual plays i've read mostly reflect exactly what drove a different group nuts about <i>With Great Power\xe2\u20ac\xa6</i>--it seems like the mechanics drive the narrative, rather than the other way 'round. [Which, in said actual play reports, appeared to be seen as a good thing, so perhaps exaggerated a bit.]<br/><br/>In WGP, specifically, it felt like we were fighting the system more than working with it--very frequently, what made the most sense narratively was impossible due to the cards you had. And <i>moreso</i> than when using a non-Narrativist-supporting game like, say, BESM. And i'm not talking success or failure, i'm talking what the character did. The cards often made it impossible to, say, act in the characters idiom (the big brute smashing, frex), when nothing in the scene or situation would've prevented that. For us, the mechanics didn't create story, they derailed it, and thus when the theme/premise did get addressed, it felt really artificial, because it felt like the whole story had been twisted out of recognition in order to get there. This was a group that i put together specifically to play WGP, all really interested in [my conception of] Narrativist play, and trying to do that. And, a few times, it really shined--it gave us a couple moments that were as good as anything i've ever encountered in an RPG. Surrounded by lots of blah or almost-frustration.<br/><br/>----<br/>Other responses: <ul><li>'woodelf' is fine, in fact, preferable--i've always considered it good form [online and off-] to use whatever handle a person has chosen in that context. Aids in communication, too, 'cause then everyone knows who you're talking to/about.</li><li>Thread drift isn't an issue, IMHO, so long as it's part of the natural direction of the discussion. Heck, i'm pretty sure i've drifted this thread as much or more than anyone else. Personally, i find the practice of splitting off into a separate thread the minute the topic drifts kinda stifling to the exchange of ideas. Though i really miss the UseNet way, where you could simultaneously continue a thread and change the topic. Maybe someday web forums will catch up to the useability of UseNet.

Because there are exactly three things that give you mechanical advantage in PTA:  your Screen Presence, which (if any) of your Edges are applicable to the conflict, and other players giving you Fan Mail.<br/><br/>Screen Presence can sorta-kinda be strategised, in the long-term sense, but there's nothing you can do about it during a session to finagle an extra card.  Edges also seem like a pretty clear-cut "they either apply or they don't" case to me.  And even if you do think there's wiggle room on getting your Edges to count in a particular conflict, any given character only has a couple of them total.  Finally, you can't really control whether other players give you Fan Mail in any concrete sense.  The closest you can come is to try hard to make your play entertaining and make sure you fit the show's mood, theme, etc.  And I have trouble seeing how that sort of behavior could be seen as bad.<br/><br/>It sounds like when you say "not Gamist" what you mean is that it's impossible (or at least very hard) to make more- or less-optimal mechanics-based choices, am I right?

I also might seeing things that aren't really there and thus jumping to conclusions. <br/><br/>I'm not the best guy at the whole GNS thing, but, as a gut reaction, the quote above, especially the parts I bolded, don't really sound like you're looking for something Narrativist.

And moreso than when using a non-Narrativist-supporting game like, say, BESM. And i'm not talking success or failure, i'm talking what the character did. The cards often made it impossible to, say, act in the characters idiom (the big brute smashing, frex), when nothing in the scene or situation would've prevented that. For us, the mechanics didn't create story, they derailed it, and thus when the theme/premise did get addressed, it felt really artificial, because it felt like the whole story had been twisted out of recognition in order to get there.</blockquote>\nDisclaimer: I've never read or played "With Great Power". I also might seeing things that aren't really there and thus jumping to conclusions.<br/><br/>I'm not the best guy at the whole GNS thing, but, as a gut reaction, the quote above, especially the parts I bolded, don't really sound like you're looking for something Narrativist. (It actually, for my limited understanding, sounds more Sim then anything else, but I'm probably full of shit on this.) It sounds less like you're trying to address a specific premisse and more like you're trying to tell a specific story, which IMO are not the same thing.<br/><br/>From what I understand, Narrativism seems to be more about tackling a single issue and have the story happen basically as a byproduct of the choices made, while your struggles with WGP make it sound like you're looking for something more "pre-planned" or at least more-fitting-to-my-expecations-of-this-specific-story.

Just something that made sense.<br/><br/>Let me use an analogy: Wolverine is fighting Magneto. How do you expect the fight to go? Probably Wolverine getting all psycho-badass and cutting things up, and getting the crap beat out of him but healing. Maybe a bit of strategy, maybe some using of the environment (like chucking something large and non-metallic). Magneto, OTOH, will be using tons of strategy, mostly using the environment (we'll ignore his ability to use his power directly on Wolverine's skeleton and pretty much end the battle instantly, just for sake of argument). And he'll be smart about the whole thing, using very clever strategy. Now, if Magneto just grabs a fire hydrant in one hand and a dumpster in the other (using his power) and does a berserker charge and starts bashing on Wolverine, you don't think "huh, that's a bit unusual", you think "who the fuck is writing this issue?" And if Wolverine steps back, and comes up with some super-clever strategy involving advanced chemistry, and stays calmly in control when Magneto threaten's Jean Grey's life, you'll probably think "wait, is this Beast or Wolverine?"<br/><br/>Now, an occasional deviation can be really cool. Take that last example--you're gonna immediately be not only puzzled, but intrigued. And it could turn out to be a not-so-subtle clue for a plot twist (Prof. X is mindcontrolling Wolverine, say), or a point of genuine character change. But if that sort of thing happens in every single scene, sometimes multiple times to one character, it isn't a cool twist, it's Dadaism. [Well, i exaggerate, obviously.] That's how the game felt to us. We couldn't even establish character sufficiently to make deviations obvious--everything was a deviation [from the initial character conception]. Well, not everything, but way too much.<br/><br/>Also, i should be clear: WGP does a good-to-excellent job of bringing theme into the game. It would be fair to say that it did as good of a job as our choice of characters and character traits allowed--i can't fault the game for that. And i *want* theme in my games, and in my stories. It's a large part of why i love B5 more than most other TV shows--it has underlying themes that the plots and characters are exploring/illustrating.<br/><br/>It's just that, at lest in our experience, in the process of addressing theme, it turned any potential storyline into a disjointed jumble. So, the only "specific story" we were trying to tell was "the story of what happens when these characters run into these villains", and any outcome that didn't force "these characters" to behave like "those characters" (whoever they are) would've been just fine. No stronger preconceptions of the plotline than that--i know *i* had no idea what was gonna happen beyond the current scene, and certainly had no preconceptions of how that scene would turn out. Yes, some cool ideas of how it *might* turn out, such as what the villain might say as he gloated, if he won. But that was about it. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fifth_child</cite>I've played a one-shot of With Great Power.

And if you only have cards of a different suit, you have to change actions. So if i smash you, your only choices might be to smash back or to yield the conflict--not dodge, even if you're playing Spider-Man fighting the Hulk. Conversely, if i attack you with my telepathy power, and you have an appropriate response power (like, say, psychic static), if you don't have any cards left in that suit, your only options are to use a different tactic, or yield. You can't try something and fail, basically. Now, only just as i was posting this message did it occur to me that some verisimmilitude could be salvaged narratively by, say, Prof. X responding by trying to resist the mind probe, discovering he couldn't, and then dodging out of the way to break line-of-sight. As opposed  to Prof. X being mind probed and immediately dodging around the corner. But both could mechanically be represented as meeting a power with a dodge--the failed psychic resistance has no game-mechanical represntation.<br/><br/>Anyway, i agree with you, from experience, that the mechanics do an awesome job of enforcing the story arc. And very importantly, that part felt totally naturalistic to us, and the only time we ever thought that the mechanics stuck their nose into the story in a noticable way was when a conflict that we'd all gone into thinking was "just another conflict" turned out to be the one where the hero defeated both one of the villains and his nemesis (the same person), and suddenly we had to shift mental perspective to "this was the story climax" from "this is part of the mounting tension"--and we didn't see it coming, so we'd both set the scene and been playing the conflict pretty tension-buildy, rather than shaking-it-all-out. But that probably had a lot to do with our unfamiliarity with the mechanics, coupled with unfamiliarity with the playstyle.<br/><br/>It's within a given conflict that they felt very artificial, as i've said above.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70078">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arminius" title="Arminius"><img alt="Arminius" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/588/nMC0KH12ZK6VM.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arminius">Arminius</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70078/#Comment_70078" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-17T14:27:38+00:00" title="May 17, 2007  2:27PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Woodelf,<br/><br/>I really hate to contribute to the trend of saying "I've never played this game but based on your preferences, I think it'll be great for you." But in this case it's tempered by the fact that both of my recommendations are available for free, at least as a very functional initial download.<br/><br/>So, the games:<br/><br/><a href="http://www222.pair.com/sjohn/risus.htm" rel="nofollow"><i>Risus</i></a>: freeform traits as with Dogs, but a more straightforward resolution system that doesn't call for the type of resource management or narrative strategizing that can take you outside your character. I believe the game has some similarities to Over the Edge and Heroquest, but the rules are shorter.<br/><br/><i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i> (one edition <a href="http://www.smokingmirror.net/SoY/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, others at Clinton's site): more GURPS-y, with structured character construction and skill lists, but still very simple in most ways. More explicit mechanical conflict resolution, and the extended resolution is harder to work out on paper than it should be--but either some snap rulings or reference to discussions on the net should hopefully clear that up. The key thematic mechanic is the use of Keys which reward players for having their characters act in character, so ideally a lot of the play should be driven by that: do what you're character wants to do, and see what happens.<br/><br/>Both games seem well-suited to being paired with GMing advice along the lines of what's in DitV, Sorcerer (really the supplements), or (for a freebie) Chris Chinn's advice on "Flag Framing" and "The Conflict Web" which was on his blog...though the blog is now defunct, you might be able to locate the info somewhere. Levi K's scenario generation mechanics for Microcosm (<a href="http://members.shaw.ca/LeviK/" rel="nofollow">look here</a>, not sure which PDF is most current) are similar IIRC.<br/><br/>Again, this may just be bunch of speculative nonsense but your desire for thematic gaming combined with discomfort with "gamey" mechanics makes it sound like these might be worth investigating.

Several of those categories are pretty fine divisions, IMHO--if you're pummelling someone and want to grab a baseball bat, technically you have to switch suits.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/woodelf" title="woodelf"><img alt="woodelf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/woodelf">woodelf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70144/#Comment_70144" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-18T07:41:58+00:00" title="May 18, 2007  7:41AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elliot Wilen</cite><a href="http://www222.pair.com/sjohn/risus.htm" rel="nofollow"><i>Risus</i></a>: freeform traits as with Dogs, but a more straightforward resolution system that doesn't call for the type of resource management or narrative strategizing that can take you outside your character.

I've had a PDF of it sitting on my harddrive forever, but i tend to read and then forget about PDF games, and they're a harder sell to the group (one of whom refuses to be online). My one concern is that, the minute a whiff of humor slips into an RPG, one player tends to go gonzo--i swear if we tried to play Buffy he'd turn it into a Mel Brooks production. Had that problem when we played QAGS, which is somewhere between Risus and Shadows of Yesterday in both style and complexity, but expressly aimed at "beer&amp;pretzels" RPing. But that's not an artifact of the rules, at all, it's purely social. If only that player wasn't married to the best player in the group...\n<blockquote><i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i>(one edition<a href="http://www.smokingmirror.net/SoY/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, others at Clinton's site): more GURPS-y, with structured character construction and skill lists, but still very simple in most ways.

I'd still rather find an appropriate extreme-Narrativist-end-of-the-spectrum RPG that otherwise fits the group, to try and sell them on the playstyle, but assuming that doesn't work (or never happens in teh  first place), i've been trying to persuade the tacticians in the group that tSoY would give them enough to do, while the rest of us wouldn't be overwhelmed, and would be pandered to by other parts of the system (notably the Keys).\n<blockquote>Both games seem well-suited to being paired with GMing advice along the lines of what's in DitV, Sorcerer (really the supplements), or (for a freebie) Chris Chinn's advice on "Flag Framing" and "The Conflict Web" which was on his blog...though the blog is now defunct, you might be able to locate the info somewhere.

And, i gotta say i was really surprised when the flag framing article made a big splash a couple years ago, because i thought it was a common tool in the RPG toolbox, known to everyone (right up there with pacing and level of detail in descriptions). I first saw it formalized on TAOGM-L in the early/mid-90s, and hadn't realized that it hadn't propogated to those interested in theory and design technique. But, then, a lot of the "inventions" and "discoveries" i've seen come out of the Forge and Forge diaspora are things that i saw invented/discovered (and maybe not for the first time then, either) on r.g.f.advocacy or taogm-l a decade earlier. So, yeah, i'm familiar with flag framing. I'll have to check out the conflict web and microcosm stuff, in case it's new (rather than old idea, new-to-me name).<br/><br/>Sorcerer's on the list, too. Not sure i could get the group to play it, though. Not sure they'd enjoy it, either (though i'm pretty sure i would).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html
