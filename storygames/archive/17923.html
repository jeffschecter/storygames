My guess is that they probably want to destroy Freemarket, because they got thoughts like greed and envy, which also was confirmed when I heard my gaming group first attempt to play the game: they tried to destroy Freemarket.<br/><br/>So when I finally got to play the game, I discovered that it was a trading game where you build a company up from scratch.

I was so disappointed when I discovered that all the sentences in the beginning of each chapter was explained later on in the chapters, that I sold the book. I later on did some reconsidering and came to a conclusion that it's still a great game, so I bought a new copy. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I was disappointed with how <b>In A Wicked Age</b> handled it's oracles too, although we probably played the game wrong.<br/><br/><b>My Life With Master</b> - I thought that we were going to play imps in Dungeon Keeper that tried to suck up to the keeper.

Roger Caillois defined what you wrote as <a href="http://onlyagame.typepad.com/only_a_game/2006/01/the_imagination.html" rel="nofollow">mimicry</a>. Games are not just game mechanics. It's the rewards and engagement that you get from striving towards a goal. Greg Costikyan defines games as "an interactive structure of endogenous meaning [meaning: only affecting things within the games' frame] that requires players to struggle toward a goal" in his essay I Have No Words &amp; I Must Design.<br/><br/>Games are about finding patterns and when you've done that, the game becomes boring. Theory of Fun practically says that games are about learning.

But, yes, it works best if whoever is framing scenes is aware of the Keys. When I GM Solar System/TSoY, I actually use Key combinations from the character sheets to create scenes, and it makes the game incredibly easy and fun to play.)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405636">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405636/#Comment_405636" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-07T02:09:54+00:00" title="February  7, 2013  2:09AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 7, 2013 2:11AM by Upstart.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>For me, this stuff has always been an excuse to play pretend,</blockquote>\nBut that's a game as well.

The missing piece is that you don't take Fallout dice when you Give. So if someone says they shoot you dead, you always have the chance to say, "No, wait, stop! I give." In this case you don't take any Fallout dice from the gun, just from any Blows you Took earlier in the conflict. Each time you take the Blow, you take Fallout dice relevant to the type of Raise that was made: if someone punches you, it's d8s, if they say something at you, it's d4s, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405759">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405759/#Comment_405759" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-08T12:33:59+00:00" title="February  8, 2013 12:33PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In AD&amp;D, somewhere listed xp awarded form monsters as, say, "1200 + 4/hp".

Although I managed to figure out that monster rolled a d20, which made it a huge problem. We played probably three or four games with the poor Magic-User trying to outroll monsters with a measly d4. WE STILL THOUGHT IT WAS AWESOME.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
