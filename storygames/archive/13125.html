Luckily, the text is tight (and short) enough that it doesn't hit too hard. But I've needed to draw up a few sample characters and factions and have them "beat each other up" in order to understand the rules a little better.<br/><br/><b>* Idly considering Warhammer 3e:</b> Two people (me and Travis) in our regular group have it, and we're working out a "you run it, I'll also be familiar with the rules and help facilitate": But we're working out which of us will take on which role. I'll probably end up GMing, Travis will be "handling the setting", as I'm not as deep into (or interested in) the Warhammer setting. Our goal is to get a game off the ground before the end of the year, if even for a session or three.<br/><br/><b>* Rewriting the setting of Legend of the Five Rings</b>. Yeah, /rewriting/. I'm really torn between taking what I like from L5R and hacking a new setting and 1-2 rules for The Shadow of Yesterday, but more likely I'm going to write a small but complete setting reskin for this game. It will have many of the same elements, and all the game rules will be the same, but the setting will be different. Basically, it's an attempt to add in Buddhism, Shinto, and deeper Japanese cultural pieces/elements into L5R. Basically, what will emerge is a kind of L5R that looks as if it may have been written by a Japanese person. <br/>This started as a project to rewrite a few NPC/family/location names in order to make it not so fingernails-on-chalkboard for me and my friends. But after one small change, then another, then a third, then a few more, I found myself with the blueprint of an almost entirely reskinned setting. Probably the best comparison is Vampire the Masquerade vs Vampire the Requiem: Same rules, different core setting elements, different overall feel. <br/>All in all, it's about 4-6 pages long, and the core L5R "stuff" is totally compatible with this reskin... We'll see if it emerges. It's only been very recently that I've been putting fingers to keys on this.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_295884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295884/#Comment_295884" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-04T23:29:50+00:00" title="October  4, 2010 11:29PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Getting set to run FreeMarket with the regular group, if we can figure a way around the five-players problem.<br/><br/>Constantly thinking about Apocalypse World hacks.

I don't know when the GM spotlight is going to turn to me but I know it's going to happen since they rotate GMs fairly frequently and I want to be ready to when everyone is feeling up for a bit of experimentation.  They are a bunch of fairly mainstream guys (in terms of what they tend to play) so beyond my excitement in playing AW, it seems like a pretty good way to get the indie bug in their ears.<br/><br/>* Creating material/sheets/data for an existing game?<br/>I've been cooking up a character for said group's Eclipse Phase game and finding myself wishing that the designers had gone all the way with it.

I've got hundreds of Netrunner cards spread across my dining room table most evenings.  I've enjoyed creating controlled-environments for CCGs for years, mostly Magic and Shadowfist.  This is the first time I'm trying it with Netrunner, a frackin' amazing game that got lost in the shuffle of the CCG-glut.<br/><br/>I began playing Magic when it first came out and there's something about the crazy un-optimized decks of that era that I'm always trying to recapture.  Designing these environments is also a lot like game design.  Sometimes I'm just making a Tolkien-esque Elf/Treefolk deck and a Goblin/Orc deck that are really fun to play against one another and tell a kind of story when they're played; there will be often be sub-systems and rules unique to the environment, anything from new victory conditions to weird if-then clauses (e.g. when the third Elf falls in battle, Autumn Willow enters play from the "Legend reserve deck").<br/><br/>More often it's a league where all the players draft or are given cards from a pool where each of the cards is unique except for perhaps a few utility cards.  There's something very magical about being the only wizard in the whole "universe" who can summon <i>the</i> Force of Nature.  Or maybe even you're the only mage with access to potent commons like Lightning Bolts or Disenchant.<br/><br/>So for the Netrunner league each of the players will begin with identical sets of Hacker and Corp cards, mostly Common but a few Uncommon, all single cards except for a few multiples of filtering, money-making, or card-drawing cards.  From these cards they'll build their decks and after each match they'll draft a few cards from a pool of cards made up mostly of Uncommons and Rares, and mostly one-of-a kinds.  So maybe you're the only hacker in the world that has a Succubus daemon.  There will also be some rules that allow the loser of a game to steal cards from the winner to keep the environment in flux.  Maybe some kind of mid-match sideboarding rule and/or trade windows, etc.  Every league is different.<br/><br/>As a part of that lonely fun I'm simultaneously working on a Netrunner-GHOST/ECHO one-Player-and-GM game where you play GHOST/ECHO for a bit, then jack into the Net to steal stuff from the Corp.  The RPG fiction would influence the Hacker deck contents and then the outcomes from the Netrunner game would inform the role-playing fiction that followed.  The Corp-GM will play for keeps as hard as they can but their deck will be constructed to be relatively vulnerable to the hacker's deck.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_295947">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295947/#Comment_295947" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-05T11:27:42+00:00" title="October  5, 2010 11:27AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I keep going back to the same few things.  \n<ul><li>I'm running Dictionary of Mu and trying to come up with more Bangs.<br/></li><li>I keep thinking about In A Wicked Age and about doing a ridiculously huge play aid for it (like, a play aid bigger than the original text).</li><li>I'm hoping that I'll get to play more when I move to Toronto proper this winter.</li></ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_295949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295949/#Comment_295949" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-05T11:46:57+00:00" title="October  5, 2010 11:46AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Trying to remember everything that happened from a session of AW from five weeks ago - the last time this group played.

I think I finally cracked my violence move, which makes me so, so happy. Also, creating demons for the Warhammer game is a blast. I have 6 demon lords loose in the city now and they are up to <i>no good</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296138/#Comment_296138" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-06T21:37:08+00:00" title="October  6, 2010  9:37PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John: You better share  that Warhammer World hack sometime.

We prep'd for a game of Seth Ben-Ezra's Showdown. It'll be very interesting to see what comes from having an old wise woman and a trusted servant of the cheif facing each other. It'll be a farily gritty viking fantasy kind of thing. I'm stoked!<br/><br/>I might be running a game or two at a drop-in convention here in town on saturday, so I might prep for Panty Explosion tomorrow. I'll probably be using my <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9190" rel="nofollow">school girl name signs</a> as usual, but maybe I should have a demon or three thought out in advance this time? Yeah.

The premise is the party operates a tramp freighter working off their debt so they can own the ship. Setting is before episode 4 of the movie. The playgroup has very little knowledge of the expanded universe of Star Wars, so we're keeping it tight to the original trilogy as a starting point, but we may veer off.<br/><br/>We kick off the campaign using the WEG d6 system. After we establish the party, their drives and connections and the set pieces, then we will flip to other game systems while keeping mostly to the same PCs. For some systems (like Dogs in the Vineyard), they may play pregens, but those characters will be a smaller part of the party's big story... whatever that ends up being.<br/><br/>To get the group to buy in, I agreed to do all the heavy lifting, but this will be fun to watch how the systems affect their play and their options.<br/><br/>Been buying some cheap space opera supplements off rpgnow to give me fodder for ideas this week.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_296317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296317/#Comment_296317" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-08T21:53:14+00:00" title="October  8, 2010  9:53PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I created two characters for Chris Perrin's MECHA RPG, and did a a small combat (characters come with an enormous fighting machine by default) to get a feel for the system.  I might run a 1-shot of this next week.  I like the look of the turn structure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
