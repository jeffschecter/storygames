The game is supposed to model episodic medical drama and I think it's going to.  The thing that is most interesting to me, and is a feature of both this game and <i>Business Solutions</i> (which we also kicked around hard) is the blurring of the line between character and player.  In both you do stuff as a player, you compete and perform, and your ability to do stuff has a direct impact on the fiction.  I know some people will hate this, and that's OK.  Everybody else won't, and those are the people I want to play with anyway.<br/><br/>My doctor went to the carnival and there was a teenaged drug addict, overdosing!  It was a very television moment.  Luckily there was an AED nearby and I restarted his heart after five tense tries - I got to shout "clear!" which is, of course, a primary design goal.<br/><br/>Joel's guy terribly botched a low tracheotomy, and as a result accrued a ton of stress (the game's currency).  Apparently Joel doesn't know what "two centimeters" means.<br/><br/>Clinton's guy was enmeshed in a struggle over the directorship of the trauma unit, which went to the sexy new surgeon he lusted after  (played by Mike), who had a great moment with a trauma patient who had been shot four times in the thorax.  There was also some nonsense about a drug yet to be approved by the FDA that had caused some deaths.  For a largely mechanical playtest, some good story was emerging, which is promising.<br/><br/>Big thanks to Mike, Joel and Clinton - you guys broke the creative logjam on these designs.  Having three sets of fresh eyes questioning my assumptions and proposing zany solutions was so valuable.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjq9dxCJtg" rel="nofollow">Here's the promised spleen operation</a>.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153798/#Comment_153798" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-30T07:49:35+00:00" title="June 30, 2008  7:49AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps you could keep a taser on hand for anyone who doesn't get their hands clear in time during a defibrillator scene.

He wanted to use party balloons, X-Acto knives, I don't remember all the stuff he had planned.  Mike suggested obscuring trauma wounds with red sharpie to simulate blood.  I think that is a promising sign, because I'd like players to be authoring their own procedures.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Erik_Battle" title="Erik_Battle"><img alt="Erik_Battle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Erik_Battle">Erik_Battle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153895/#Comment_153895" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-30T13:35:45+00:00" title="June 30, 2008  1:35PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What a hoot!<br/>\n<br/>\nReminds me very much of that Wii game where you get to do medical procedures.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis would be super fun at a party with a lot of drink!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_154031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154031/#Comment_154031" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-30T22:13:03+00:00" title="June 30, 2008 10:13PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Codexier</cite>This would be super fun at a party with a lot of drink!</blockquote>\nThat would be against every professional code of practice in the book!<br/><br/>This looks great.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154055/#Comment_154055" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-01T05:08:00+00:00" title="July  1, 2008  5:08AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Steve Segedy</cite>Perhaps you could keep a taser on hand for anyone who doesn't get their hands clear in time during a defibrillator scene.
