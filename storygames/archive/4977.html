Just a survey really.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you eat while gaming?<br/>\nIs it a meal?<br/>\nOr is it snacks?<br/>\nDoes the host provide?<br/>\nDo the players provide?<br/>\nIs it byo?<br/>\nIs there a favored style of meal?<br/>\nIs there alcohol?<br/>\n<br/>\nI usually eat and drink something whenever gaming, unless that's specifically not ok with the group, and even then I usually step out and eat some snacks from my pocket to keep my blood sugar even.<br/>\nAt our regular sunday game there's almost always dinner, and I usually cook. Lately I've been favoring casseroles and baked pastas that I can prepare before people get here. At various other games we go to it's usually "snack luck" with people each providing a little. That works well.<br/>\nSometimes people chip in for the sunday meal, but i'm ok with feeding people, and beverage is usally brought and left, so that makes it even in my book.<br/>\nSometimes we have a few beers or wine with dinner. once in a great while we have some whiskey. We used to smoke green stuff, but that was back in college, and the games were more casual in tone then.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111800/#Comment_111800" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-04T22:17:51+00:00" title="December  4, 2007 10:17PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We usually wind up with people getting fast food or some such shortly before we start (on account of usually starting around dinner time).
