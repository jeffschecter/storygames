Players can pay points to start scenes, to start conflicts, to affect the narrative, and so on. We got into a discussion about the best way to handle PC participation in scenes.<br/><br/>As the system stands, when a scene is started, every character can potentially join it. I e, if I start a scene wherein my character is confronted by muggers in an alley, Larry might say something like "my character, who's just passing by, jumps into the fray". <br/><br/>Now I figured, sometimes maybe you want a scene for yourself. Or just between two characters. Or three. Far as I can tell, there are four ways to handle it.<br/><br/>1) By social contract. Every character is potentially in every scene, and if you don't want Larry to jump in, you'll simply have to tell him.<br/>2) Pay to shut out: you can pay extra points to explicitly shut a character out from a scene.<br/>3) Pay to join: The player who starts the scene decides which characters will be part of it, but if Larry isn't one of them, he can pay extra to get in<br/>4) Scene-starter decides: The player who starts the scene decides which characters will be part of it, and if Larry isn't one of them, he'll just have to wait until the next scene.<br/><br/>Looking at these four possibilities, what do you think are the pros and cons of each? Which one would you find preferable, and why?<br/><br/>/Karl                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113854">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113854/#Comment_113854" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-12T14:47:15+00:00" title="December 12, 2007  2:47PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Option <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> is what Universalis uses, as I recall.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_113863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113863/#Comment_113863" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-12T15:02:51+00:00" title="December 12, 2007  3:02PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> because it can include <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>.

Behaviors are not indicative of one element of a design, but how all the pieces interact.  So telling someone just one piece and saying "What behaviors does this encourage/discourage?" doesn't really work.  You can go the other way, and given a behavior ask how mechanics might work with it -- but like everything else in game design, it's based on gut feelings, personal experiences &amp; conversations with other people.<br/><br/>Or, to restate:  the only way to truly answer your latest question is to <em>try</em> those methods in this game and find out what behaviors you see.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_113906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113906/#Comment_113906" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-12T17:00:33+00:00" title="December 12, 2007  5:00PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To follow-up, by itself <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> seems like a "Dude, go away!" vibe, only because we don't know the rest of the system.

You can still look at something in isolation, it's just that the answers you get will be less accurate or assured, and they fail to take into account the entire game.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, all answers you get at this point are shots in the dark.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, here's my shot in the dark:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I see potentially happening in #2 or Alvin's variation (which I much prefer!), is this:<br/>\na.) Since it costs valuable resources (how valuable are they, actually?), people don't do it often. When they do, it's a clear signal that "hey guys, I seriously have a plan for this one. Spotlight on me!"<br/>\nb.) Similarly, I can envision a lot of people having mastermind scenes - ones they pre-craft in great detail and save resources for. "I really want the showdown between Zorgon the Mage and Bathos the Warrior to be just the two of them, duelling on a stormy cliffside. Hm... That'll take 1 point to frame, 3 to buy the other players out, and 1 to control backdrop narration.

Something like Alvin's "compel" mechanic, except the exclusivity would be uniform.  If I put up 3 points of exclusivity in my mountain retreat, it costs anyone who wants in 3 points to be "passing by."  For maximum fairness, you might give the scene starter a by, but require that any other PC by paid in - although the starter could subsidize them.  So having almost everyone over to your underwater lab might get quite spendy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_114234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114234/#Comment_114234" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-13T17:59:39+00:00" title="December 13, 2007  5:59PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Judson - call it an 'ante' and make the game about high stakes gamblers shooting each other and chasing each other in cars.
