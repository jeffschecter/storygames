But one of the interesting things about roleplaying is deciding under what circumstances your character will act on or break with their motivations.  So rewarding only 'acting on' defeats that somewhat.<br/><br/>What Ive done is to reward either option - simply narrating considering the motivation during a decision is enough to get a reward. Which is explicitly what Id like the players to do, but the rule itself is kinda wishy-washy.  It doesnt have a solid edge to it if you know what I mean.  And its hard to get that edge because I dont want the player to make the decisions tactically based on a mechanical trade-off, I want them to make the decision according to the fiction that seem right to them.<br/><br/>Can you give something like this solid mechanical backing without destroying the waht you are trying to back up in the first place?<br/><br/>If so , how?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324201/#Comment_324201" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-12T17:09:57+00:00" title="May 12, 2011  5:09PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>"Oh!

At least, not in roleplaying games. If players aren't interested in playing to their motivations, just giving them a cookie every time they do won't make them like it.<br/><br/>What reward mechanics do is make us <i>notice</i> those moments in play - they require us to look at those parts of the fiction and make judgements about them.<br/><br/><a href="http://onmightythews.com/" rel="nofollow">On Mighty Thews</a> handles this by giving the player two different beneficial but not interchangable rewards based on whether they acted towards or against a particular trait. It works because it:<br/>a) is based on concrete behaviours, not just the way something is described<br/>b) requires judgement of the fiction, moment-to-moment<br/>c) responds to the kind of fiction the players are already invested in creating, i.e. sword and sorcery heroes in perilous situations<br/><br/>I basically stole the idea for this from Clinton Nixon's "Keys" mechanic. That dude has farted better games than I'll ever write.<br/><br/>People often make the mistake with Keys of thinking they're a way to "encourage good roleplaying" or to "force people to play their character right". They're not. They're a way of recognising significant moments of play - of focusing attention.<br/><br/>EDIT: Added link to OMT site because I am an imperfect human, and I want your cash.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324207/#Comment_324207" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-12T17:19:15+00:00" title="May 12, 2011  5:19PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 12, 2011 5:26PM by stefoid.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, thats the 'why' of it, but the 'how' is the part I am having trouble with.

In Simon's case, it sounds like a tradeoff between effectiveness right now or a resource which can be used for effectiveness later. Since neither one of those is universally preferable (as opposed to the "reward" vs. "no reward" in your jump left example), there's less incentive to spam one particular choice. In <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forge/index.php?topic=30792.0" rel="nofollow">this Forge thread</a>, I talk about how I've tried to design around the related problem of trait spamming and trait grubbing in <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/blog/final-hour-of-a-storied-age/" rel="nofollow">my game</a>. <br/><br/>It sounds like you're trying to make "act according to motivation", "act in a way that's irrelevant to motivation", and "act against motivation" all seem like valid choices to the player at each instant.

What your player wants is to be able to make a gut-level fictional choice that can be easily rationalized so they can feel confident they've made a good choice (in my opinion, of course).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324214/#Comment_324214" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-12T17:36:01+00:00" title="May 12, 2011  5:36PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dan is right.

You have statements on your sheet for each of the six Values (Duty, Glory, Justice, Love, Power, Truth) and your Relationships (numbers of these vary). Your statement informs how you normally exert these traits in the fiction, i.e. "Nobody should conceal the truth" as a Truth statement means that if you're doing something for which this is an appropriate statement, you can roll that trait in. However, you can also challenge the statement and roll 3x the dice, but the trait steps back by one die size until the end of the episode. My Truth d10 thus gives me 3d10 if I act in opposition to my statement (for instance, if I'm covering up the truth) but my d10 steps back to a d8.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the end of the episode you can step the trait back up again if you also rewrite your statement, or you can leave it stepped back and step another trait up by one (if it's a Value) without rewriting the statement. This choice, again, asks you to decide if your character has changed what they believe, or if in response to challenging their beliefs they're no longer as invested in them (the reduced die).<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nCam                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324254/#Comment_324254" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-12T22:13:38+00:00" title="May 12, 2011 10:13PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 12, 2011 10:22PM by stefoid.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Its a fine line isnt it?

It has the reward tradeoff between going with your Value and changing it that I think you're looking for.  I think changing the value statement is key here.  When you act against one of your values as written, it's a big moment, not just "Bob's brash guy decided to be careful.  Again."  Now you get to see the contour of why, in this case, it was ok.  Or maybe the character has realized how much brashness costs him and is now trying to reign it in.  I'm curious to see how often Values get challenged in Smallville play.  I could easily imagine one getting challenged in most conflicts.<br/><br/>Personally, I think the mechanics should generally reward, or at least encourage, acting on motivations.  The fictional choice usually already has an asymmetrical reward already (risk your life vs look on safely, keep your oath vs huge profits.)  I usually see motivations (I'm thinking specifically of Fate aspects) as tilting the table back towards "do the thing that will clearly end badly for you, but is in-character."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324310/#Comment_324310" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-13T08:36:53+00:00" title="May 13, 2011  8:36AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the issue is mechanical boons for acting a certain way are incentives, right?

What if we're playing with a group of like-minded people who are all in it for the same thing?  We all want to address the same premise, we all want to have character motivations and choose to break them at dramatic moments in order to create awesome, memorable play.  The incentive then is great fiction.  <br/><br/>This may be unreliable, but it seems like the only choice we have is unreliable play that will not be satisfying if the group wants different things OR incentivized play that can be abused if the players choose to go that route.  I'm not sure either is better and no matter how you alter your incentive scheme Steve it will always have a point at which it can be abused.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324357">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324357/#Comment_324357" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-13T13:37:33+00:00" title="May 13, 2011  1:37PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks everyone                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_326060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/scramble" title="scramble"><img alt="scramble" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/scramble">scramble</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326060/#Comment_326060" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-24T04:29:55+00:00" title="May 24, 2011  4:29AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 24, 2011 4:37AM by scramble.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Charles,<br/>I think you nailed it right there.<br/><br/>In my experience, those rewards (XP in TSOY/FATE Points) have several effects:<br/>1) They lure the trad gamers to play the way you want.<br/>2) They explicitly state what is expected behaviour.<br/>3) They force players to stick to a character concept.<br/>4) They give the GM flags to work with.<br/>5) They enable heroics.<br/><br/>If you already have super-creative, premise-focused, drama-loving players that don't mind losing conflicts once in a while, you don't need much of the reward stuff. (You can do with minimal System, then. But the job of System is to drive play in a certain direction. Always assume the players NEED direction.)<br/><br/>My experience is that trad gamers tend to play defensively. If the system says "This is dangerous", they won't do it. If the system says "This might be suicide for a normal guy, but I'll give you a FATE point so you might just make it" or "You will most likely fail, but this FATE point will enable you to make a heroic comeback later" then they will do it.<br/>In order to make an interesting story happen, you need somebody to do something brash/stupid/foolhardy. Just look at Greek Tragedies or just any Opera.<br/><br/>The only point that stays a valid reason for rewards is <a href="/forums/search?Search=%235&amp;Mode=like">#5</a>. It's like "With Great Power..." that you might to get hosed early in the game, but the promise is you WILL get a comeback.<br/>It's not quite genre emulation yet, but the way you do your reward system has a definitive impact on the resulting story. FATE Points increase drama, XPs give the game a "growth story" spin.<br/><br/>PS: Does anybody remember the "sausage machine"-discussion?

We've played a number of different implementations of FATE as well as Burning Wheel, all of which have a similar reward cycle. The game I liked the least amongst these was Dresden Files because there was basically a FATE point treadmill requiring characters to constantly engage with the same themes to generate the FPs necessary to power their skills, especially when approaching a big fight. This happened less in other FATE games such as Swashbucklers, Diaspora and LoA because characters had more FPs anyway, or their skills were less dependant on them for use. The reason I don't like this is because the FP treadmill is a constraint too far (for me, YMMV) on character behaviour making development of the narrative less interesting.<br/><br/>The Burning Wheel belief system is more interesting to me because the reward is relatively minor (I've got 8FPs after two sessions which I haven't had an opportunity to use because I haven't been injured or only once rolled any 6s which needed rerolling) and so players feel far less constrained to go after these goals meaning their characters' behaviour is less narrow.<br/><br/>My favourite implementation of this kind of system is in Mortal Coil. Each character has 1 to 5 passions which can be used to boost a character's total score in a conflict by 1-5 (more usually 1-3) points. It's a minor difference in the scale of things but in the many games I've played, the passions become a strong driver of character behaviour. They are implemented in a slightly different way because they are about how a character feels about something rather than a goal (as in BW), this allows for a larger range of behaviours and hence outcomes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_326078">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326078/#Comment_326078" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-24T06:35:49+00:00" title="May 24, 2011  6:35AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 24, 2011 6:38AM by jenskot.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Burning Wheel is interesting because you don't have to play by your Beliefs.

In effect, the Artha reward cycle isn't about "roleplay this way" but more "tell us what you want out of the game... and keep us updated as that changes." This cycle also doesn't feel too in your face because you earn rewards at the end of the session, not for every action you take like in The Shadow of Yesterday, which I love, but sometimes I feel some games devolve into XP begging in a way that feels cheesy. <br/><br/>Burning Wheel adds another level by rewarding you for losing tests and helping other players. Your skills advance as you use them but you need to try different levels of difficulty to advance, including levels so difficult that you will most likely fail. But in the end, failing now means advancing later. And what's difficult is relative to your current condition. The more hurt you are... the easier it is to get those challenging tests. The system encourages you to take crazy risks, especially when you are wounded. <br/><br/>Experienced BW players yearn for challenging tests! To the point where <b>they will push the GM to make the game harder! </b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326091/#Comment_326091" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-24T07:35:29+00:00" title="May 24, 2011  7:35AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite>The game I liked the least amongst these was Dresden Files because there was basically a FATE point treadmill requiring characters to constantly engage with the same themes to generate the FPs necessary to power their skills, especially when approaching a big fight.</blockquote>\nI think the most important missed rule in Dresden is that you can change one Aspect per session. That way you're not constantly playing to the same thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_326099">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326099/#Comment_326099" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-24T07:57:36+00:00" title="May 24, 2011  7:57AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 24, 2011 7:58AM by GB_Steve.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We did know about that rule but it didn't help much, possibly because our game of DF was more conflict heavy than our game of BW.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
