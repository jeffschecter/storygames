And you need to think about whether people will use the app offline a lot, whether the cost of data traffic is an issue, how many requests (or socket connections) the server can handle etc. You could also have the devices communicate directly with each other via Bluetooth; IIRC from the documentation, that's pretty easy to do in iOS, but I haven't done it myself - and it doesn't seem to be something a lot of apps do.<br/><br/>2: It's fairly easy; it's all done in one project, which has a different set of graphics files and (IIRC) GUI classes for the two screen sizes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/john" title="john"><img alt="john" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/john">john</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349350/#Comment_349350" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-21T10:57:30+00:00" title="November 21, 2011 10:57AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do frameworks/tools like PhoneGap and jQueryMobile/ jqTouch even enter the picture for shops that have developed skills developing in ObjectiveC for iOS?

I actually don't remember hearing about those tools. I don't think we use them. Sometimes we buy or use frameworks developed by others (FastPDFKit, for instance, or ShareKit) to solve specific tasks (in this case, PDF rendering &amp; social media sharing).<br/><br/>2. Apple changing their technology in unpredictable and sometimes undocumented and/or bug-ridden ways. The approval process. 1-star reviews in app store from users experiencing technical problems. <br/><br/>3. Being in the forefront of new technology. Developing better and better processes for smooth, functional development (which is not an iOS-specific thing, I guess). <br/><br/>4. Sometimes. Nothing at all like the annoyances of cross-browser compatibility, for instance, and I understand Android developers have bigger headaches than iOS developers with this. Basically, we just support the latest two OSes, since people tend to update frequently; and iPad and iPhone are the same when it comes to coding, they just differ in screen size. A few annoyances will always pop up (like when iOS5 suddenly deleted a lot of user data for existing apps because they changed a policy, or when a lot of users were unable to start apps on iOS5 if they didn't manually sync them after updating their OS). But it's pretty good in general.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/john" title="john"><img alt="john" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/john">john</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349460/#Comment_349460" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-22T09:52:58+00:00" title="November 22, 2011  9:52AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for answering my questions.

However, 1) users are used to them, so if you make an app that requires typing, they won't get annoyed at you for it; and 2) it's a creative constraint to make apps that don't use the keyboard. (Angry Birds and Cut The Rope, for instance, are pretty successful!)<br/><br/>My favorite types of apps... hm. Small ones that can be finished? Just like most of my projects, I like working on something with a finite scope. (Which is not what I do at work right now, actually <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> )<br/><br/>I used to be a Flash developer. Then I was looking for a job some 2-3 years ago, and a friend of mine (who also did Flash) was working at this company. I asked if they needed people, and he said yes, if I was willing &amp; able to learn iOS instead, because they were planning on going into that more. So I applied, and spent some time learning it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349556">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/john" title="john"><img alt="john" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/john">john</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349556/#Comment_349556" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-23T11:20:56+00:00" title="November 23, 2011 11:20AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_349639">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349639/#Comment_349639" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-24T18:14:18+00:00" title="November 24, 2011  6:14PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>Nothing at all like the annoyances of cross-browser compatibility, for instance, and I understand Android developers have bigger headaches than iOS developers with this.</blockquote>HOLY MOLY that's putting it mildly.
