I don't think anyone, myself included, was intentionally doing this, but we picked up on it when someone asked when was the last time someone needed to be healed.<br/><br/>Is there a system(s) out that can treat combat/large scale battles as more of a narrative with some dice rolls for resolution? The players decide on a course of action, <i>"we'll all gang up on the Ork boss and do our best to avoid his Goblin lackeys"</i>, and then we roll some check/test to determine how well their plan goes off.<br/><br/>As I'm describing this I can think of so many things that would make this difficult, but I wonder if someone has designed something cool to manage this kind of thing.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463373/#Comment_463373" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-16T12:38:32+00:00" title="May 16, 2017 12:38PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Archipelago</i> is all about this.

When you've got some tense exciting moment in the game, and you really want to know how it unfolds, and then we zoom out, reduce the whole conflict to some set of stakes or question or narration rights or something, and resolve that with some randomizer / resource management, and we're done.<br/><br/>I want to know how it happens, man. I want the blood and the grit!<br/><br/>And, sure, we can just refuse to zoom out so much. Instead of using our mechanics to resolve "Do I win the fight?" we instead ask question like, "do I get inside his reach?" But that's kinda not the level most of the games ya'll have mentioned so far are meant to resolve stuff at. And there's no guidance on how to break stuff up into interesting but manageable chunks, how one bit flows into the next, and so on.<br/><br/>The closest is probably *World style games, more Dungeon than Apoc. It still doesn't quite scratch my itch, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463389/#Comment_463389" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-16T20:00:05+00:00" title="May 16, 2017  8:00PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 16, 2017 8:00PM by BeePeeGee.">edited May 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeph, I find it important that everyone is comfortable with the level of zoom in/out. In story games I moderate, I usually encourage players to request  "zoom in/out'.<br/>Sometimes, you encounter  group of mooks and want to be done with. A quick stakes resolution on "zoom out" should do it.<br/><br/>Then, when you want to zoom in like in your example, for me it's either a <br/>- top-down approach where you break-down the fight or encounter into several challenges or a<br/>- sequential approach where you zoom into the first challenge and move through them as they unfold.<br/><br/>Another aspect is also that the resolution determines "what" the end result will be. Still, it can be exciting to discover and roleplay together "how" you eventually get there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy" title="Fuseboy"><img alt="Fuseboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/294/n454M25FRHU6K.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">Fuseboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463390/#Comment_463390" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-16T20:02:46+00:00" title="May 16, 2017  8:02PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A few relevant systems that aren't what you're asking for, but might have pieces of the puzzle.<br/><br/>The Regiment (which is a WWII game) has moves that scale up very nicely, so they can hit battlefield 'narrative beats' without being too grainy. When you assault a position, that might be just your PC charging up some stairs, or it might be you and a platoon trying to dislodge a bunker. There are genre-appropriate moves like providing covering fire which (again) can be just one machine-gunner, or a whole fireteam.<br/><br/>Torchbearer, on the other hand, has a little mini-game for combat (or conflict of any kind). This is similar to the Duel of Wits and Range &amp; Cover subsystems in Burning Wheel, but it's generic. The cool (and relevant) thing about it is that you always specify a goal - are you trying to kill the enemies, just drive them off, take control of a room, etc.  The actual meat and potatoes of it can be a little vague, narratively, but it's a huge shift from the default of "kill them all in slow motion".<br/><br/>When I'm rolling up battles to one roll, something that bugs me is that the details aren't relevant. I had a PC in my game that was amazing at one-roll resolution because he was hiding behind a buffed stat (Burning Wheel Sword, B6) but had so many other deficiencies that he was dead meat in the detailed combat system.<br/><br/>How do you keep these details important without using really detailed resolution? Blades in the Dark does something neat with planning. It basically says, "skip planning," and just focus on one detail that's relevant to the sort of mission you're carrying out. If it's a heist, then the deception is the big deal. If it's an infiltration, then the point of entry, and so on.<br/><br/>This leads me to the idea of a two-roll battle resolution system: 1. Determine what the decisive factor seems to be, 2. Roll that.<br/><br/>So if you're holding a corridor against a bunch of armored orcs, skip all the rolling to-hit and damage, the key thing is whether you're disciplined (and armored) enough to hold the line in the face of a hail of blows.  If you're fighting a rear-guard delaying action against zombies, it's (again) not about hitting them so much as it is making good use of terrain to avoid getting trapped. If you're part of an archery ambush, it's all about coordination and accuracy (etc.)<br/><br/>These /could/ be moves, or they could be randomly rolled (influenced by the type of situation). That way players know that their armor, discipline, accuracy, etc. might all matter, but not which for any given fight. And yet, the conflict's crucial moment is still resolved by one roll.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463395/#Comment_463395" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-16T21:01:41+00:00" title="May 16, 2017  9:01PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fuseboy, I like it a lot.

Players can accept, decline, or make a counteroffer.<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>Players want to engage the orc while avoiding the goblins? GM offers them to roll speed, tactics or maybe come up with a relevant illusion and roll illusion magic; if they succeed, then they have three rounds without the goblins, after which two goblins per round enter the fray. Or you can also have them roll their murdering skill to check if they manage to defeat the orc before being overwhelmed, if you don't want to play through that in detail.<br/><br/>A mechanically confident GM can simply offer such options and improvise them on the fly. If the GM is not mechanically adept, and at least one player is, then they might want to have that player make the suggestion and the other players and GM consent or not.<br/><br/>Use plenty of opposed rolls. Be generous to the players, when in doubt. Don't make the suggestions too fancy; the example above might or might not be too fancy, depending on your pace of play and the people involved.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PatrickRBG" title="PatrickRBG"><img alt="PatrickRBG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PatrickRBG">PatrickRBG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463413/#Comment_463413" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-17T11:47:35+00:00" title="May 17, 2017 11:47AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>If you can't think of any at all, I always encourage people to look at <i>The Pool</i>.

For examples, take a look at "Bringing Down the Pain" in TSoY and "conflict series" (I may be misremembering the term) in Trollbabe.<br/><br/>In the latter, you decide, going into a conflict, how many rolls it will take - just one, best 2 of 3, or best 3 of 5?<br/><br/>In the former, you roll, and, on a miss, you can extend it into a long, drawn-out rigmarole.<br/><br/>You might also take a look at my game <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/20513/thus-began-the-adventures-of-eowyn" rel="nofollow">Thus began the adventures of Eowyn...</a> for a very simplified version of that.

Either with a simple contest, where you make one roll (or all the PCs make one roll each if its a group conflict), or make multiple rolls to see who can be the first to get 5 resolution points against their opponent. The difference between the two is how invested the players are in a blow-by-blow version of the narrative vs. a quick conclusion and move on.<br/><br/>The Solar System has a similar idea in 'Bringing Down the Pain' (the former version of the Solar System - The Shadows of Yesterday - was something of a love letter to the first version of Heroquest, Hero Wars). A player can 'bring down the pain' if one roll resolution does not provide the conclusion they want, and drill down on the encounter.<br/><br/>Because a Heroquest extended contest is quite often multiple simple contests, then I quite often recommend riffing off Bringing Down the Pain in The Solar System and allowing the players to call for an extended contest by 'bringing down the pain' TSOY style.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463580/#Comment_463580" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-27T16:58:56+00:00" title="May 27, 2017  4:58PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just played UA3 (Unknown Armies 3) and liked the idea of percentile project goals for the team (sorry for the incorrect terminology, I played in German):<br/>- When you make progress toward your team project goal, you roll 2d10 and add it to your % achievement.<br/>- You can either keep on doing this until you reach a certain 100% or<br/>- you wrap-up the goal and make a final roll on d100.

You've got the overall stakes, but the fight itself is not necessarily "do I get inside his reach" (although it could be!) but a set of narrated moves which do the back and forth play by play of the fight, rather than a simple "one and done" like OTE gestalt combat and PTA do.<br/><br/>Functionally, the real tech here, however you accomplish it, is "key scenes" -- you don't mechanic ever bloody bit of the fight; you describe things until you get to a key moment and then mechanics that bit, repeat to the next.  As long as your abstract system handles this well, the players are choosing to descirbe what's important about the fight; what's important mechanically, though, is that it have the capacity for back and forth, be based around the narrative and narrative positioning (which can involve actual physical positioning), and that it be over in about 15 minutes to half an hour, tops.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465153">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465153/#Comment_465153" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-30T10:02:40+00:00" title="July 30, 2017 10:02AM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The problem with normal combat mechanics is that they have a) special rules for special situations and when mechanics takes too long, it disrupts the flow AND makes the player focus more on reading dice than narrate, b) they rely heavily on randomness which makes it hard to predict how long a fight will take (no one wins if they all miss), and c) the hit points - especially lots of them - makes it a grind fest (because hit points are actually a pace mechanism).<br/><br/>Also, what normal roleplaying game systems do is d) describing what happens which makes the player not describe anything. "I roll to hit ... using sword ... well, then I guess I hit with my sword ... again".<br/><br/>To solve this:<br/>a) Don't make it harder than it has to be. Focus on other aspects. If you want your players to narrate, make it into a challenge to narrate instead.<br/>b) Remove randomness. What randomness does, and why it's used, is because it creates unpredictability. There are <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/422143/#Comment_422143" rel="nofollow">tons of ways</a> of achieving that, like social contingency - you don't know what the next fellow will do.<br/>c) Hit points. Do we need a pacing mechanism and what will that do in?<br/>d) Removing descriptive mechanics. Create a gap between mechanics and fiction, and let the players' narrations bridge between them. "I roll to hit ... using love ... well, how should I describe this?"<br/><br/>In <b>This is Pulp</b>, the game master puts down X stones and describes a new situation. When the players do X descriptions they solved it. That's it. The players also need to involve up to three things depending on what move they use. It's the game master's duty to really vary the situations, otherwise you will end up with the same solutions to the same problem.<br/><br/>That's how I achieve narrative combat. Fast, action paced combat, filled with descriptions.

The characters and gm have to describe (roleplay) what happens each and every round.

You can feint and sidestep, try to measure their reach to adjust the timing of your attacks, make superficial blows to impair your opponent a bit, etc. The % could be changed by both sides on each exchange, and even allies and environmental factors could be included.<br/><br/>I like a lot the idea that in any moment you can risk going for the final blow or fight more cautiously.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465662/#Comment_465662" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-16T17:41:45+00:00" title="August 16, 2017  5:41PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Absolutely.

We played the first session Sunday, which included one real fight, and I think how that played out is very relevant to this thread.<br/><br/>So, the game doesn't have a real combat system. Here's what it does have.<br/><br/><small><b>A core mechanic.</b> Which is basically, the GM asks the player to roll a d20. On a middling result, the expected, obvious thing happens. On a higher roll something better, on a lower something worse, with natural 1s and 20s maybe bringing results outside the intended scope of the throw. And a variant of the core mechanic where the GM can name a target number for a binary (ish) result.<br/><br/><b>Saving Throws.</b> The players each have written down a target number for saves versus Hesitation, Dread, and Trauma. When they want to do something, but their character might be too slow-witted or confused, to paralyzed with fear, or too disabled by pain and injury to do it, the GM can call for one of those saves. If they hit their TN, they act unconstrained; if they don't, they might not be able to do it.<br/><br/><b>Damage and hit points.</b> The GM can assign out a few dice of damage (usually 1d6, but can be half a d6 or up to 3d6 or more) to a PC or NPC, which are rolled open-ended and summed and applied as damage against hit points. Very D&amp;D.<br/><br/><b><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fkeUpKRQ-S-WS_xHZKae-kIXCoczgBSCyMtTyPHsC3M/edit#heading=h.4ypd2jz032ri" rel="nofollow">Lots of advice and technique.</a></b> Stuff like, "When a player in the spotlight hesitates, the character hesitates."<br/> Or, "Characters who stand and shoot, letting the enemy come to them, are more likely to get an extra shot in, but likely sacrifice the initiative and the ability to pick their foe as opponents draw near." Or, "A powerful thrust from a spear or tapered blade with full weight behind it can pierce through mail, though a weaker or opportunistic jab will not; a slashing cut will almost never cut mail, though a chop from a heavy axe might, especially if the enemy has been knocked to the ground and can't roll with the blow."</small><br/><br/>And it turns out that that's all you need for <i>really good fight scenes</i>. It puts the focus entirely on the fiction. We get dramatic results: struggling to string your bow while beast-men barrel down at you, allies suddenly dropping and shifting the tide of battle, duels turning into scrabbles in the dirt for a knife, archers picking off an enemy who was about to jump onto your back just in the nick of time.<br/><br/>And all this happens <i>fast</i>. With no calculating of bonuses, no checking of AC, players who know that if they don't respond immediately the action will move on around them, it plays out faster than it takes to type up what happened.<br/><br/>So that's <i>one</i> way to do narrative combat. Few rules, broad GM authority, a couple very specific break points where the GM can definitively say "It's out of my hands and up to the dice now", and lots and lots of technique.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465682">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465682/#Comment_465682" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-17T02:51:17+00:00" title="August 17, 2017  2:51AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, "lots and lots of technique" is the key there, isn't it?<br/><br/>I wouldn't expect those rules to produce great play on their own, but with the right approach and the right skills... they can certainly enable it.
