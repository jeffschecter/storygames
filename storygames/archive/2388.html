<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2063&amp;page=1#Item_20" rel="nofollow">[Sons of Liberty] â€œPre-Alphaâ€ Playtest &amp; Discussion (long)</a></cite>Swapping Tory Player and Circumstances<br/>We only played through one objective.  In the after-game recap, I was a little surprised to find that the players were interested in swapping out the Tory player role between objectives (instead of at the end of the three-objective session).  They were also curious how they could swap out circumstances for something else â€“ either because what they had wasnâ€™t working for them or because they wanted to try something else.<br/><br/>My thinking in designing the game was that every session would have a different Tory player and each session the Patriot players would select and customize their Figures anew.  So if I played John Adams last time, I could play Ben Franklin the next.  Or, if I really wanted to keep playing John Adams, I could play him with an entirely different set of favored circumstances.  That was odd enough for me, but apparently the crew wants even faster turnover of PCs and pseudo-GM.  Iâ€™m still not sure what to think of this.</blockquote>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: me again</cite>In any case, when the scene ends (by the Patriots moving and seconding a scene end or the Tory player collecting at least three face cards), the Patriot score is compared to the Tory score and the highest score gets their stakes.  Everybody narrates a little bit of the scene wrap up, with the Patriots going in order of the highest card left in their hand and the Tory player going last if he won or first if he lost.  Whoever has the lowest card in their hand frames the next scene and sets the sceneâ€™s stakes.</blockquote>
Sudden inspiration while editing a lab activity about water pressure!<br/><br/>What if all players at the table create a Patriot, and each scene has a different Tory player, determined by the cards in everybody's hand?  Perhaps at the end of each scene, the guy with the lowest card remaining gets to frame the next scene and will choose which Objective it will addres.  Everyone is dealt their hand of three cards, the scene-framer frames the scene, and <em>then</em> whoever's new hand has the lowest card (I imagine it's one of those, "who has an ace? a two? a trey" things) becomes the Tory player?  (This would also ensure that the Tory Player has at least one low card, and can't immediately end the scene.)<br/><br/>This would make the Secret Objective difficult; perhaps everyone draws a Secret Objective at the start, and can reveal it in any scene where they are playing Tory?<br/><br/>The first scene needs to be framed by someone (picking between "chase scene," "big fight," and "explosions"), but the Tory player could easily be determined by the initial hand.<br/><br/>With the Tory player selected after the scene frame, there's also the slight problem that the Patriot that won't be played will somehow be central to the scene-as-framed.  Would that be a problem?  Would the Patriot still be in the scene, just not played by their normal player, or would they step out?  Is that something that the Tory player can declare as they take up control of the adversity?<br/><br/>Here's the big question (probably not THE big question): would finding out that you're the Tory player in charge of the scene's adversity <em>after</em> the scene is framed be a let down?  Would you get all fired up to do something and then wham, all the sudden you can't?  Alternately, would framing the scene not knowing which Patriot will be suddenly taken out of the action add an entertaining uncertainty?                </div>

                            I probably need another playtest to wrap my head around these qs, but my initial impressions are that determing the tory player on the fly would seem to work with the pick up and play nature of the game.<br/><br/>could cards be distributed &amp; tory player picked before the scene is framed?                        </div>

                            Actually, Mark, I'm thinking it goes:<br/>a) at end of scene, lowest card gets to narrate a "cut scene" that sets up the next scene (like in video games of this ilk)<br/>b) deal out cards<br/>c) cut scene narrated, explaining how PCs got from where they were to where the action is going to be, and stakes for the upcoming scene are set<br/>d) Tory player selected.<br/><br/>So this would work a great deal like Judson's final scene frame in our playtest: he narrated right through kidnapping the wife and getting her to the governor's mansion, and play started when you set foot on the grounds.                        </div>
