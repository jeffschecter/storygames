I decided to juice it up and have three questions instead of six, which works beautifully.  You get a shorter game, and some real focused tactical decisions about where to allocate dice - do you <i>really </i>want to end the entire story, or are you going to put a good die in Reveal?  Here we are, playing in the chemistry classroom:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/viking_con/photos/psi_run_02.jpg"/><br/><br/>Frederik and I decided to be GMs, and Peter, Kjeld, and Thomas made Runners.  We had a Runner who occasionally set things on fire when she was too focused, a Runner who tended not to be noticed (and could fold space and time), and (my favorite) a Runner who was a tattoo-covered old man who would black out and "explode" like an overloaded emotional battery, so people tended to die if he was angry and Thomas put a low die in Psi.  Which happened twice.<br/><br/>We set it in Copenhagen, and the game opened with the Runners waking up in a life raft in the \xc3\u02dcresund, the channel between Denmark and Sweden.  The opening was slow, and we didn't really get a chase going until later in the game - we should have, in retrospect, had the Chasers on their ass immediately.  As it was they got run over by a boat, swam to shore at Helsingor, blew up both a police station and set Kronborg castle on fire, and the shifty firestarter, who we discovered was a master assassin, headed for Amager, a somewhat seedy Copenhagen neighborhood to meet her old boss.  Eventually everybody got captured and taken to "The Institute" in Amager (does every PSI Run game have one of those?) and they discovered the awful truth - they were all secret weapons, and their task was to kill each other until one survived.  In other words, a pretty typical PSI Run session.  Our story track:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/viking_con/photos/psi_run_03.jpg"/><br/>PSI Run is a great game.  It ran smoothly despite 80% of the players using a foreign language.  We had fun and ended up with a very exciting and slightly weird story - nothing like what Frederik and I had schemed at the beginning.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103388">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Call%20Me%20Curly" title="Call Me Curly"><img alt="Call Me Curly" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Call%20Me%20Curly">Call Me Curly</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103388/#Comment_103388" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-17T04:45:38+00:00" title="October 17, 2007  4:45AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How long did you play?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chris_moore" title="chris_moore"><img alt="chris_moore" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://jesus8880.com/chapters/gematria/images/greek%20letters/psi-cap.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chris_moore">chris_moore</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103393/#Comment_103393" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-17T05:42:15+00:00" title="October 17, 2007  5:42AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, Jason!

Indeed, the beginning was a bit slow as we were trying to figure what we were supposed to do - and I guess the game would have benefitted some from a harder GM-hand for the first couple of scenes. But once the ball got rolling, I had a blast. The fiction, although being the result of very little detail and a lot of improvisation, felt very coherent and engaging and as I also told you after the game, Jason - I had emotional reactions to the events in the game. It's game I'd play instead of a board game any time!<br>\n/Peter                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103398/#Comment_103398" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-17T05:57:53+00:00" title="October 17, 2007  5:57AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: chris_moore</cite>What did your co-GMing look like?

After that I took a scene framing role and Frederik filled in color and took the lead on characters.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: chris_moore</cite>I heard from Peter that you had 1 or 2 rolls per scene?  Did that just happen naturally?</blockquote>\nI think so.  I'm not exactly sure how you'd end up with a lot of rolls in a single scene.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: chris_moore</cite>How did the story move from one scene to the next? Was it based on where the Runners were going next, or did you and Frederik frame more aggressively?</blockquote>\nWe framed aggressively, particularly at the beginning.  I said "what would be a good goal for you now?" a lot.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: chris_moore</cite>Did you use Scars, or penalty dice for injury?</blockquote>\nNo!  Damn it.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: chris_moore</cite>Did everyone narrate their own epilogues?</blockquote>\nYes.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: chris_moore</cite>I definitely prefer the lizard and army guy to the colored blocks <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></blockquote>\nMe too, but space was at a premium when I packed...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
