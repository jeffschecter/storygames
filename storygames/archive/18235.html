MACE, Dragon*Con, and StellarCon, and AncientCityCon.<br/><br/>It can be done, and it's a pretty easy way for people who want to judge a game based on a few seconds of visual inspection to do so.  It worked for MACE particularly well, because I only provided those bound "menus" to people who already signed up for a GoD slot, and were already at the table, and wanting to make a decision as to what to play.<br/><br/>It did not work for most of the other cons, because the "menu" was available to people as a tool for deciding if they wanted to sign up for a GoD slot.<br/><br/>Alternatively, Kelley set up a folding menu (11 x 8.5 folded twice) that had a picture of the cover (or a picture of an appropriate action-y sequence if the cover was unavailable) with a quick pitch.<br/>-The pitch was limited to 140 characters, so that it could be "tweeted" to friends if someone found a game and wanted to test the waters with their friends<br/>-The pitch was framed by the people who would run the game there at the convention, not by the game designer or some star reviewer, so that when someone went "tell me more" we could tell them more.<br/><br/>It looked something like this:<br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxkY2lnb2R8Z3g6NTBjZTkzMjkzN2Q0ZmQ0" rel="nofollow">Click Here for PDF</a><br/><br/>That was <i>supplemented</i> by a more in-depth menu at D*C GoD this past year, but when presented with both options, people consistently looked through the menu, talked with their friends, and then wanted favored more face-to-face information over the printed menu.<br/><br/>The menu was the same presentation quality as the smaller pamphlet, with the same full-color, and often the same images (higher quality and larger.)<br/><br/>So our lessons learned would discourage us from using a menu, unless it was just internal use to remind our GMs of the talking points.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411369/#Comment_411369" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-05T07:53:11+00:00" title="April  5, 2013  7:53AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would do <a href="http://erebaltor.se/rickard/GamesOnDemand.pdf" rel="nofollow">something like this</a> - double-printed paper that you fold once.
