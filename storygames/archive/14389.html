Well, maybe it is a little.<br/><br/>I'm working on my Cyborg game recently. I keep bouncing around from setting creation, to character creation, to game system, to theme and how I see play forming. I'm writing lots of things down, talking about them at length with people, and trying to visualize. I guess I'm still in that brainstorming phase.<br/><br/>I'm one of those gamers that really likes character central games (vs combat central or... world building central games). There's lots of buzz on here recently about character building, but I don't think its been addressed in quite this way.<br/><br/><b>My questions</b>: Is character creation the most important part of the role playing game? I mean, the whole game is pretty much about the PC characters, so it should be pretty central, right? Does it extend beyond that into, maybe, having the character sheet be the most important part of the game, because its the artifact you interface the most with when you play? Is there another point I'm missing here that I should delve further into when thinking about character creation and character sheet interaction? <br/><br/>I'm trying to focus on this issue critically while I'm designing. I know certain games have a sort of psychology behind situation and character building... I'm trying to get at that I guess.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326912/#Comment_326912" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-30T11:13:35+00:00" title="May 30, 2011 11:13AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To a large extent, I think it is.

That's the part that a lot of games don't convey very well.  Often character creation is super fun, like in Rifts!  And being GM and daydreaming about what play might be like is super awesome! But then once you try actually do things with the stuff on your character sheet, the game hits some bumps.<br/><br/>Your character creation can be super fun, but if it doesn't feed easily into what actually happens in play, people will make a lot of characters but maybe not play your game so much.

You know; the stuff we jot down on a paper to make it easy for us to create a character in play ...<br/><br/>- yes, for that is where the <i>real</i> character is created; in play! So the game-play is the most important part of the game, obviously. <br/><br/>The character preparation will only be important if it feeds the interpretations of the character; the <i>real</i> character creation, done by the player while engaged in the game. In many ways the creation of a character takes a whole life-time; the life-time of the character; from the moment you start playing it, to the moment you leave the game, never to play that character again.<br/><br/>Hope this helps your thinking on "character creation" in some way, Kira.

Shannon A. wrote an interesting article in 2003, and one of the distinctions was between character development and storytelling. If the emphasis is on character development, and the focus is on what computer gamers consider to be an RPG, then character creation is pretty crucial. You want a strong base to develop from. If your focus is on storytelling though, then it's important in a different way. I'm quite fond of systems that have collaborative character building of some sort, which automatically integrates the characters together in the plot. In that sense it's still important, but it's how the characters relate to each other that's important, rather than the capabilities of the character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326955/#Comment_326955" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-30T16:42:27+00:00" title="May 30, 2011  4:42PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>To a large extent, I think it is.

I like characters that actively evolve through play with their character sheet, instead of point buy systems. I think maybe, I'm talking about the character sheet and how you interact with it as a whole, instead of just the initial phase of character creation. <br/><br/>I also like the <b>Situation</b> as focus, and having character, drama, setting be parts of <b>Situation</b>. That logic makes lots of sense to me. Whenever I think of game systems, I think of moving parts in a machine. You need all of the parts to interact in order for the game to work, so of course you can't have characters without having something tying them to the drama, mechanically (the way I like my games, anyway). I'm trying to extend the cyborg metaphor to character creation and the system as well, so its like, this circuitous interactive thing. So like, taking the idea of a circuit, literally, action and feedback, and applying it to how the system works on the meta level as well as thematically, so that the act of playing the game is akin to being a cyborg. Character creation is totes gonna be an ongoing process, because cyborgs are all about change and transformation. I think it's that bit that's confusing me, because I'm working off the basic assumption that character creation ends at the beginning of the game, but how can I keep it going without making it like IAWA. I think for systems like this, I'm looking most at Burning Wheel and Apocalypse World, for sure. They keep the character evolution smooth and constant. I'm picturing it working like that.<br/><br/>I'm picturing a flow chart here, with Situation at the top, and the rest flowing out beneath it. Being a visual learner, I think that might work it out for me. Is this a literary thing? Has someone in game design made this chart already that I could refer to?<br/><br/>Thanks for gamestorming with me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327081/#Comment_327081" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-31T12:19:45+00:00" title="May 31, 2011 12:19PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Make the chart!

This happens by the players doing all the things you list: interacting with characters, developing the characters, narrating the fiction etc. (Used to be that the GM had more tools for these things than the players, but we've got a lot more selections of options now a days.) </li>\n<li>Character creation/evolution and interaction are subsets of Character. Drama, Relationships and Action are ways character interacts with setting or is used to establish the setting. (Relationships may fit as a subcategory of character creation or interaction?)<br/></li>\n<li>Theme and mood underly and inform everything, and also are continuously determined by all that is done in the fiction, as well as at the table (eg music, laughter, side talk, focus etc.). </li>\n<li>Objects and Places here are elements of setting, which makes them look pretty external to character. They may be elements of character or important keys to interaction with the setting. Objects especially.</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>These are great questions to be pondering as you work on the design. One thing I noticed when I was working on Shooting the Moon was that at a certain point once we had finished character creation (which includes world creation as well), we could see all these possibilities for great scenes happening involving the elements laid out before us (eg beloved children just waiting to be poisoned in a Machiavelli era Italian setting, a huge manor house ready to be burned down in an Elizabethan comedy setting). However, in play, none of those things happened. So I aimed the mechanics at giving the players ways to accomplish those things. In certain scenes you can "sacrifice" traits including things like the kids and manor house, bingo!<br/><br/>Character, as a tool, is incredibly important. It's true though, that character creation per se may not be the most important thing for the player about why that is and how it is relevant in play. Jason and John's example of using pre-determined characters points to that. Though, how successfully those characters are or can be used in play means that at some point it's important, even if it's not done by the player themself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328169/#Comment_328169" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-07T07:52:56+00:00" title="June  7, 2011  7:52AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for all the helpful feedback.
