Example: I choose the Dismiss action, and when it's my turn, I roleplay my character scoffing and turning his back on yours.  Then I roll, perform some calculations, and wind up with 4 successes.  Your guy subtracts 4 points from his total; if this brings him down to 0, the watching crowd decides he's lost the Duel.<br/><br/>Sounds great, right?  And it is great, in many ways.  The strategic decisions are meaningful, there's satisfying feedback, and there's all sorts of roleplay prompts (rebuttal! obfuscate!) for players who might want them.  Players who are practiced at the system can handle it fairly quickly, focusing more on the mechanics or more on the fiction as they prefer.<br/><br/>However!  I found that it interfered with some of what I like about roleplaying.  <br/><br/>The way I learned to roleplay was based on taking in fictional stimuli, providing fictional responses, and then going to the dice (or whatever) if the rules told me that was how my response was arbitrated.  I'm in character, I see something, I attempt to do something, and then we pause the fiction in that state of suspense (hopefully not for too long!), futzing around with dice, until it is revealed how my attempt turns out.  I believe this general style of play (and rules design) is sometimes called "fiction first", for obvious reasons.<br/><br/>In the Duel of Wits, on the other hand, each time I roleplayed my character, it was an act of filling in the fictional blank for an already-made mechanical decision.  "I scripted a Dismiss action for mechanical reasons; now I must invent a way to enact that with my character."  No matter how colorful my enacting was, to me it felt like working as an actor from a (admittedly loose) script, rather than being caught up in the fiction and responding from within it (as my character).<br/><br/>No surprises there, right?  Different players have different tastes, and for me personally, Burning Wheel has some things I really like as well as some things I vaguely dislike.<br/><br/><b>My question is: can I have my cake and eat it too?</b><br/><br/>Can I get that fiction-focused experience, where I receive fictional events in-character and instantly respond in-character, while <i>also</i> having social conflicts with meaningful decisions and satisfying feedback?<br/><br/>I'm imagining something like Duel of Wits, in that you can take different actions which have different odds of different outcomes, but where those decisions are made as the character makes them: as instant responses to fictional stimuli.<br/><br/>Example:<br/><br/><i>NPC: This meeting is a waste of time.  We cannot discuss an alliance here.  I must get back to my palace before the woeful security endangers my royal person.<br/><br/>PC: If only you had the elite bodyguards we ambassadors travel with.  They're the best in the realm!  And loyal to whomever we command.  Sometimes, we give them to our most valued allies...<br/><br/>GM: That sounds like a Bribe action!  Roll your Bribery skill, which we'll resolve with its own unique procedures.</i><br/><br/>The key here is that there's no separation between the player's thought "Bribery might work!" and the character's thought "bribery might work!"  This is enabled by the fact that the player can't call for a roll by saying "I try to Bribe him"; only the relevant fiction triggers the GM to say "roll to see how that goes!"<br/><br/>Just a thought.  Perhaps this would only result in a total loss of strategic decisions ("Oh, gee, bribing him seemed natural, but my character sucks at Bribery") or in short-circuited responses ("Security concerns, eh?  Let me check my character sheet to see if I'm good at Bribery").<br/><br/>What do you think?  Any other ideas?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410001/#Comment_410001" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-21T18:03:29+00:00" title="March 21, 2013  6:03PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some of this is probably very old, well-covered ground.

Anyone experience this?.<br/><br/>The problem of discussing out of fictional stuff e.g "That door might be trapped",when your character is not in the same room to tell the cavalier door opener.

I tend to play from a very emotional place.  So when I script in Duel of Wits I script to those emotions.  Like, I've totally lost Duels of Wits because I scripted Incite even though I didn't have Intimidate at all, just because I thought my character was pretty pissed off an angry.

There's a similar effect in Sorcerer where there's an incoming attack and you have the option to either abort your action or roll just one die to defend.  Rolling the 1 die is usually a really, really BAD IDEA, but sometimes you're so committed to the action you declared you don't want to give it up so, you take the blow.  Duel of Wits to me is just a more complicated version of that effect.\n<blockquote><br/>2) Did the other players tell you that you were playing wrong?<br/></blockquote>\nNope.  My local Burning Wheel crew is very fiction savvy and Burning Wheel literate so they mostly do the same thing.  I DO have one friend who is kind of amazed by my ability to play my characters so recklessly but that's a little different.  It isn't so much about "poor system use" so much as just making passionate but clearly flawed character decisions. \n<blockquote><br/>3) Was your sense of engagement with the fiction and immersion in character maintained fairly well from the moment where a DoW was called for, through your first action?

But I notice that I tend to do something I don't think a lot of people do.  I use system dissonance as a cue for my character to self-reflect.  So, my opponent makes a Point, I fail the defense half of my Rebuttle or whatever.  I stop for a moment, thinking that something about this Point has given my character pause... why?<br/><br/>So system cues beget emotional cues beget moments of in-character self discovery.

A lot of the DoWs I engage in are quite civil affairs - allies coming to a serious agreement, or public banter exchanged through gritted teeth. It helped me to realize that not all moves make sense in a given DoW. Incite and Dismiss are pretty rude - I leave them out unless my character is angry or becomes angry.  <br/><br/>And like Jesse, I use system cues to color what and how I say things, but loosely so. I try to respond to what the other player said as with good communication (and especially if the DoW is civil) and will sometimes add something appropriate after the dice are rolled. Actually, I think paying attention to the other player and what they say is the biggest factor to a more organic DoW. Even a simple, "hmm," or "ah, interesting," and all the way up through "what the hell?! You're fucking crazy! Don't you see..." and then leading into your scripted volley makes a huge difference. I also strongly recommend adding narration where appropriate. "She pales when you say that."

So you're not even getting rid of "parts" plural, and you'd be getting rid of this if you follow the suggestion to have the audience script your move anyway, so I don't think you lose anything except the gameyness and tactics of scripting three actions and then trying to follow through. Everything else is still the same.<br/><br/>Personally I think Fight! is where scripting set actions is really appropriate, since it helps you get the feeling of a really chaotic environment where you can get a major advantage for being prepared, knowing what you're doing, and deploying a "kata" (a trained series of maneuvers). It's an excellent way to feel like your tactical choices affect a combat and you're not just relying on high skill numbers or just describing whatever cool thing you want (neither of which are bad, per se, but lots of games do those). In a Duel of Wits it can feel weird to play a character who is supposed to be socially adept get caught out with pre-scripted actions that fit neither the argument as it has developed nor the character you are trying to portray. Some people can roll with that, of course, but it sounds like you're not down with it, and I figure it's easy to make one small change, especially if it might have a big impact.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410180/#Comment_410180" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-22T22:51:56+00:00" title="March 22, 2013 10:51PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm.  I think perhaps I've derailed my own thread.<br/><br/>These tips on nudging Duels of Wits toward a more fiction-focused experience are great, and I will totally try them next time I play, but that's not really what I initially intended to talk about here.<br/><br/>My intent was that "receive fictional events in-character and instantly respond in-character" would serve as one hard criteria.  Either you do or you don't, and "don't" is not an acceptable option, no matter how gracefully you can receive system events and incorporate them into character play.<br/><br/>The other criteria was less specific: meaningful decisions, coherent feedback, good fodder for action.  Duel of Wits was just an example of one subsystem that does this well.<br/><br/>I think, historically, games that have prioritized (or just habitually adopted) "apprehend and respond in-character" have tended to rely on group-specific systems (usually "good GMs") to provide (a) reliable info for meaningful decisions, (b) the right narration for coherent feedback, and (c) various embellishments and improv for continuing action fodder.  We're all probably familiar with GMs who do this well, and others who do it less well.<br/><br/>What I think would be really cool would be a way to take that burden off the GM (and/or the group) and design a system that contributes in a way similar to the Duel of Wits, without <i>at all</i> impinging on the old-school "fictionally react to this fictional event!" m.o.<br/><br/>Perhaps that sounds insane.  The best I can say is that "through my character's eyes" is my favorite socket through which to experience RPG fiction, and having to switch to another POV (even for a millisecond!) every time important stuff goes down is simply a let-down.  Good after-the-fact fictional transcript; poor in-the-moment experience.<br/><br/>Is my desired combo possible?

I'd say most modern conflict resolution does the opposite: it <i>will</i> resolve the matter of interest at hand, but it may utterly <i>fail</i> to resolve what specific events occurred.  Which isn't a problem... unless you're intent on <i>observing and reacting to those events as they happen!</i><br/><br/>So any sort of reconciliation, I think, would have to sort this out.  <br/><br/>Brainstorm:<br/><br/>- GM has an Interference budget.  GM can only interpose so many hindering events between a completed Task and a player's Intent per session.  The size of the budget is not perfectly known, and the GM needn't spend all of it.  The point here is to assure the player that the GM can't repeatedly say "Okay, you complete that action, but before you can get what you wanted, something else happens..."  If the GM does that at all, the player at least knows that a budget is being exhausted, making the road ahead easier.  It might also be necessary to qualify Interference as "interfering with the Intent and requiring other Tasks, but never rendering the Intent unreachable by any Task".<br/><br/>- Player announces Intent.  Narration continues up until character attempts a minute Task which will bring them closer to achieving their Intent.  Task failed?  See below.  Task succeeded?  That directly means the character is closer to their Intent.  Narration continues.  If the GM chooses not to spend from the Interference budget, narration will lead to completed Intent with no further rolls.<br/><br/>- Dramatic option: whenever completion of an action would result in immediate achievement of an Intent (character's Intent is to escape from prison, and they are in the process of descending the outer wall undetected), GM can cause Interference at reduced cost (or for free?).<br/><br/>- Task failed: well, that didn't work; now you'll have to try your second-best option, which might have lower odds of success, plus deal with any obvious consequences of the failure.

Changes the strategy and the mechanics in some fundamental ways.<br/><br/>The audience decides thing I'm cool with though.<br/><br/>Oh, also: one thing you're kind of missing if you don't play BW for a long time: getting pissed and deciding to script a hopeless Incite *is* playing well mechanically. You may lose the DoW but get a huge Will test out of it, for example. The advancement system is the part of BW that most requires many consecutive sessions of play to really "get," but once you do it can really help mitigate much of this "oh no! the game doesn't want me to do what my guy would do!" feeling. To an extent anyway.<br/><br/>The other part of this is that I think people playing BW need to be more willing to play their characters as self-aware about what their social skills are. Sure, the character wouldn't think in terms of, "Hey, I have an Oratory of 6 but a Persuasion of only 2," but they might think, "Well, I'm great at getting crowds to do what I want, but not so much with one-on-one negotiations."<br/><br/>After all, we think in terms of our own real-life skills all the time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410318/#Comment_410318" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-24T11:41:53+00:00" title="March 24, 2013 11:41AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 24, 2013 8:44PM by David_Berg.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt, good points about the upsides of failure and "I wanna do this thing, but I'm better at another thing" being an in-character consideration too.  If I took the time to insert some "my guy's tempted to incite, but realizes he'd be better served by orating a good point" narration in between "look at stats" and "script move", the experience would probably be more satisfying to me, in no small part because it would remind me that even if I as a player can brilliantly roleplay inciting dialogue, this is an area where my character and I differ.<br/><br/>Tim, having a strategically interesting mechanical back-end that's consulted only after satisfying intervals of roleplay is a really neat idea.  The problem I've typically had with this sort of thing is that the mechanical results of Roleplayed Action 1 aren't available as considerations for Roleplayed Action 2.  But I guess there are are various interesting roleplay sequences where the characters don't immediately know the exact impact of what's happened -- the crowd's reaction to a rebuttal, whether that last sword stroke hit an artery, etc.<br/><br/>I have no idea how this would feel.  Would all semblance of strategic thought go out the window because of the feedback delay?  Would the roleplaying become oddly warped as players struggled to think and act strategically without any concrete cues to employ?  Would ritual phrases develop?  Would the "perform to convince the audience" aspect interfere with everything else?

Because the dialectic is valuable in itself, for me, keeping the rules and the fiction in synch is not always desirable.
