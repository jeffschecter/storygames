I added that they are pitched to sell to veteran gamers, rather than general fans, and Luke finally pointed out that the dirty little secret is that the publishers count on non-gamer fans buying the books for what little extra info they may provide and never playing the games at all. If this is actually what drives sales of these products, and makes them worth the big companies' time to publish, "Why design a game at all?" Luke asked.<br/><br/>I agree. I just can't help but wonder how well these major properties would do if they were done new-style, as story games, with the assumption that the person picking the book up <i>really has never played an RPG before</i> (as opposed to the cliched newbie gamer that allegedly picks up most traditional RPGs and sees the - nearly useless, appendix-like - "What is a roleplaying game?" paragraph), is a fan of the property, and might just like to spend an evening (rather than the weeks, months, or even years of a trad game campaign) telling their own story set in their favorite universe with a group of friends.<br/><br/>Traditional RPGs are fun for me, but I've been at them for almost 30 years, but new RPGs, especially those based on licensed properties that are designed this way aren't likely to appeal to a wider audience outside of gamers who are already fans. <br/><br/>Generally, the story games I've played have been very easy to pitch, teach, and play with complete gaming newbies. They're also usually short-form, and can be completed in an evening (or three, tops). Trad games can of course be pitched to newbies as well but generally require more of an investment to get them rolling. Man, imagine if Star Wars were a full-on story game, something people could learn and play in an evening, with the level of design, graphics, and marketing resources an outfit like WotC could provide. Instead of selling 15,000 copies of a roleplaying game designed for gamers who are fans, they might sell a million copies (so I'm pipe dreamin' - sue me) to fans who might become gamers.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/alejandro" title="alejandro"><img alt="alejandro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/alejandro">alejandro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88125/#Comment_88125" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-14T23:59:24+00:00" title="August 14, 2007 11:59PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It would be fun if we could collectively purchase a license and create a story game with it... <br/><br/>Yeah, I know that collectively creating a game on a scale that would require enough donations would be... bad.<br/><br/>But, its a fun idea.<br/><br/>How about this?

Give them "methods", "techniques", and "procedures"<br/><br/>Yeah, I know this sounds like a semantic quibble. It is. But, a person's perceptions are often driven by the language you use to describe something. No matter how many times you point out that "game" as a term <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">can</span></b> describe very casual, non-competitive or not-overly-competitive activities, it will almost never be the first thing people think of when they hear the word.<br/><br/>"<i>Role-playing game"</i> is like that too. People ( those who are even aware of the term) have a similar reaction; they have a very clear personal idea of what an rpg is like. Including, apparently JK Rowling.<br/><br/>Now "<i>Story Entertainments</i>" ( to steal Chris Kubasik's term that been discussed recently)? I don't know anyone who has any particular strongly held mental definition of that term. That, or something similar, is open territory to define and claim.<br/><br/>Licensing: why bother? Other than to hold to the indie ideal of being your own publisher, what does that really hold for you*? I would think that something along the lines being suggested would work better as as a pitched concept to a publisher or ( heaven forfend) to Rowling's people ( or other appropriate persons for different source material).<br/><br/>As for increasing the body of players for pre-existing styles of game/activity? Who knows? I guess it's mostly a mass exposure idea. What is the ratio of people exposed to [Leisure Activity X] to people who become avid participants in [Leisure Activity X]? What's the ratio of people who would participate in [LA-X] after exposure, provided they didn't have to do much work? I suspect that almost any hobby activity will follow similar patterns in that regard. RPGs/Story Entertainments/Whatchamacallems are a smallish hobby. Any increase in numbers above a make-up-for-natural-attrition point would be noticable. Or, if really successful, you might generate a related-but-seperate hobby, which is cool in its own right. <br/><br/>(* "You" in the generic sense, not Ian specifically)<br/><br/>Added Afterthought:<br/>Big Game Companies and missed opportunities<br/>BGCs are set up to do what they do, much like koalas are set up to eat eucalyptus.

People who aren't gamers or hardcore fans (who care about R2D2's vocabulary). As an example, my brother, for instance. He's not a gamer. He likes Star Wars for what it is, has never done more than watch the films really. He's creative, and if he knew about a Star Wars story game that he could pick up and run in an evening with his friends, he just might do it.

An innovative game system that requires rigorous playtested is costly.  And here's the clincher: an innovative game system would not measurably increase sales -- even folks who got all excited by the system and got others to buy and play would be a drop in the bucket compared to the legions of buyers who got the book because they get everything that's <em>Serenity</em>-related.  Maybe, maybe, a really cool system would have people continuing to play the game afterwards, but from the financial perspective, unless you're selling them supplements, <em>you don't care</em>.<br/><strong>Game Proselyte:</strong> creating an innovating game system and rigorously playtesting it is a really rewarding way to spend a few hundred man-hours.  Acquiring a license to make a game about an identifiable property is expensive, but perhaps it's worth it to <em>eat that expense</em> if it gets more people playing the game.  Maybe it would be commercially successful, and maybe you take additional steps to make it so, but the commercial success is not a factor in deciding whether or not to shell out the cash for a license.<br/><br/>Or, in short:<br/><br/>Cheap System + Expensive License = Optimal Profitability, Moderate Cost, Low Proselytism<br/>Innovative System + Expensive License = Optimal Proselytism, High Cost, Low Profitability<br/>Innovative System + Knock-Off Looks-Just-Like-It = Moderate Proselytism, Moderate Cost, Moderate Profitability... ie, your typical Indie Game.<br/><br/>Oh, and:<br/>Cheap System + Knock-Off Looks-Just-Like-It = Low Proselytism, Low Cost, Moderate Profitability... ie, crap d20 products                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88214/#Comment_88214" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-15T14:52:58+00:00" title="August 15, 2007  2:52PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 15, 2007 2:56PM by Joe_Beason.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Montesa</cite><br/><br/>Now, if I handed him Star Wars D20, or even SAGA, he'd just shake his head and forget about it.

So if the rules are meant to provide a way of resolving in-game conflict (in whatever form, at whatever scale). In this regard, the rules in any RPG rules set do tell you what to do when a question comes up (or they should). <br/><br/>I think often, many trad <i>and</i> story games may do a great job of telling you how to use the mechanics, but often don't do such a hot job of telling you how to apply them to the greater goal of creating any possible narrative that comes from their use (bleah, that was hard to articulate...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88234/#Comment_88234" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-15T17:18:49+00:00" title="August 15, 2007  5:18PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Montesa</cite>I actually did play Memoir '44 with my brother, and he soaked up the rules in no time - when he wanted to know what the rule was, bam, the answer was right there.</blockquote>\nDo you think the very visual-heavy nature ( as opposed, I guess, to text-heavy) of the rules helped also?<br/><br/>I've picked up a few boxed games now that have very visual rulebooks, and personally find that it helps a ton.

It's said over and over and over again, usually in a rather self-congratulatory "my, aren't we the creative smarty types" sort of way, and that really doesn't make it true.  (Joe, not saying you're coming at it from that angle, it just seems the common delivery.)<br/><br/>Specific RPGs don't go off in so many direction.  Sorry, they don't.  If you sit down to play D&amp;D, you do not spend the four-hour session making cheese and talking with martians.  You go out, you kill things, and you take their stuff.  Maybe you're in one of those "we just call it D&amp;D but we hardly ever roll dice" game, in which case you've got a homebrew system that emphasizes the things that you like -- courtly politics and secret romances, say -- and you're not playing D&amp;D as presented in the book.  You're playing some other game that you call D&amp;D.<br/><br/>There seems to be this perfectly ludicrous assumption that RPGs should be written to support players ignoring the text in this way, and if a given book doesn't do this, it's not really presenting an RPG.  The limitless vistas of your imagination is not what RPGs are about -- that's fucking ad copy.  RPGs are about providing you a support structure for imagining and collaborating on a limited subset of those vistas.  An RPG doesn't need to be written so that it can be ignored because it's a book, and as such, it can always be ignored by the players closing the book and setting it aside.<br/><br/>To reign things back in, a good RPG <em>can</em> describe what's supposed to happen during a game in such a way that you and your group don't go careening off into interplanetary cheesemaking land and get confused.  I mean, seriously.  If you're playing a new game and you get to a place where you don't know how to play the game and you can't find the rule in the book, <em>the book was written poorly</em>.  It's not that RPGs are such a magnificent fucking hobby they can't be adequately described in text.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88260">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88260/#Comment_88260" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-15T21:25:05+00:00" title="August 15, 2007  9:25PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The fact that there are so many house rules variants of D&amp;D just prove how much more slippery RPGs are than other games.  And that slipperiness is not an asset to a newbie who's trying to learn on his or her own.  <br/><br/>Look at the discussions on RPG sites, including this one, that go like, "Before I knew it, last night's DitV session blew right past a conflict while I was saying 'yes'."  The rule is known.  But it's harder to implement because the situation wasn't a roll that landed a person on the "STOP SAYING YES AND PICK UP THE DICE" space.  <br/><br/>Even keeping to the rules, I think there's more variety of play in an RPG than Monopoly, blackjack or football.  Even the "limited subset of thiose vistas" is pretty big.

The problem is that some games that have one (or something in the same ballpark) do not explain what the GM <em>in that game</em> is for. Real, down-to-basics explanations of how non-GMs play are even rarer.

It is fair for Don't Rest Your Head to declare itself an "advanced" game, and skip over this layer.

Since it's a licensed property, it's considered canon (I think - correct me if I'm wrong) and some people are suckers for canon in any form. Most Story Games I'm aware of are really light on the crunchy details, preferring to focus on bigger pictures and allow players to fill in minutiae as they see fit - as such, the books may not be as interesting to non-roleplaying fans.<br/><br/>Having said that, I'm all for trying it out, though I'd personally be more keen to just cook up yet another unofficial Harry Potter RPG system, spread it around for free on the Intarweb and see how it fares rather than spend a wad of cash on a license for it. It's certainly an interesting idea but I'm not convinced to the point that I'd suggest anyone to sink cash into it, if you see what I mean. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Linnaeus" title="Linnaeus"><img alt="Linnaeus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://home.rushcomm.ca/~gcam/Guernica Bull.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88279/#Comment_88279" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-15T23:04:33+00:00" title="August 15, 2007 11:04PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>It's not that RPGs are such a magnificent fucking hobby they can't be adequately described in text.</blockquote>\nYeah, that's what I meant above <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88280/#Comment_88280" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-15T23:05:55+00:00" title="August 15, 2007 11:05PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 15, 2007 11:06PM by noclue.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Its a great idea Mike.

But I don't think the numbers work.</blockquote>\nI think it depends on how you're looking at the numbers. Please bear with me a sec.<br/><br/>People keep talking about buying licenses and putting out a standalone game. Under that scenario, no, the numbers probably don't add up ina favorable light.<br/><br/>However, lots of S-Gs are short. Like, very short. Among other things, it means that an S-G could potentially be a chapter within a book, as opposed to an entirely different project.<br/><br/>Suddenly, you're looking at a different animal.<br/><br/>The idea isn't entirely without precedent. If some S-G memmebrs are also historical wargamers or model makers, they're probably familiar with the Osprey books. For you folks who aren't, this is a company that puts out books describing various historical battles and the uniforms and gear worn by soldiers in various time periods. Several different hobbies use these reference books. In their Campaign series, they regularly devote the last half dozen pages of the book to gaming the battles described, often with several different approaches ( not just a toy soldier approach).<br/><br/>Again, this flies in the face of the indie-publisher ideal, so I can see why folks might wish to skip it if control of their design is a personally important aspect of the whole effort.<br/><br/>(Going even a bit further afield, both Shadows by Zak Arntson and The Night-time Animals Save the World by Vincent Baker would be great as the last section of a kids book.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88307/#Comment_88307" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-16T06:05:19+00:00" title="August 16, 2007  6:05AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>an S-G could potentially be a chapter within a book, as opposed to an entirely different project.</blockquote>\nSpione does this.

The cost of production is immaterial next to that.<br/>I'm talking about Piggy-backing a game in something else.<br/><br/>Here's what I mean, in case I wasn't clear:<br/><br/>Forget the concept of "game" as a stand-alone, with all the license buying nonsense.<br/><br/>Let's pretend that a new film comes out: Star Soldiers. Woo-Hoo! Someone, somewhere is inevitably going to have a tie in book or ten for that film with titles like "The World of Star Soldiers" or " Technical Guide to Star  Soldiers" or " "The early adventures of Luke Solo: Star Soldier". Even if the film bombs, those books will still be made and will still be on bookstore shelves. Those books are geared to fans of the source material, the people who are very likely to be potential gamers.<br/><br/>A short S-G would add up to about the length of a chapter in one of those books. Essentially, the cost of putting an S-G in that book is almost nil.<br/><br/>Of course, at that point, you're running into a conflict between the Indie ideal of maintaining full rights to your work versus selling it off for publication by someone else.<br/><br/>You're also accepting hat the game has just become the prize in the cereal box, so to speak. It isn't actually the primary focus of the product, although it may be a reason that some people choose to buy "The World of Star Warrior ( Includes the Story Warrior Adventure Game!!)" as opposed to "The early Adventures of Luke Solo:Star Warrior".<br/><br/>So back on topic, no I don't think Big Game compnaies are missing out, because they aren't set up to reach casual gamers or would-be gamers anyway, even if they did have money for a license. Only WotC has any significant distribution in non-hobbyshops (other than bookstores).<br/><br/>Small, independant game producers don't have the distribution outlets or the money for licensing to make standalone game products. What they do have is experience with short form games that very well could be piggy-backed into books, novels, comics, kids' books and similar items that are then distributed through those channels by the parent publisher.<br/><br/>Given what I understand that writers get paid, I think we can safely assume you will not get rich this way. You may, however, get a bunch of people playing your game that normally wouldn't. How that stacks up against other things you value? I dunno.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88606/#Comment_88606" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-17T13:28:37+00:00" title="August 17, 2007  1:28PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want a profile of the kind of people who buy sourcebooks but don't use them for gaming (of any type).<br/>My gut feeling tells me they're not the most sociable type.<br/>My heart of heart thinks they're buying them to show someone they argue with online that Darth Vader has a higher Dark Side skill than Darth Maul.<br/>Sheer logic forces me to accept that if the above is true, they'd be the last people in a galaxy far, far away to get a local gaming group together for some non-threatening, cooperative storytelling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
