My first extensively played system was a german fantasy roleplaying game, that was very crunchy and tried to simulate as much as possible. Over the years I became bored more and more, and some day I realised, that there are more important roleplaying goals than simulation for me. I always was a fan of minimalism in nearly every respect - eventually I detected, that this applies to roleplaying games, too. Maybe five years ago I had a very disclosing session with "Itras By": I suddenly realised, that I don\xb4t need many rules to take part in a good story and a group of characters. Rather, the absence of crunchy rules gives me freedom to empathize with my character(s).<br/><br/>Today I especially love minimalistic games with few rules. The reason seems to be, that I\xb4m simple minded. I can concentrate only on one thing at once. And when I\xb4m roleplaying I don\xb4t want to think about rules too much. Heavy rules make me consulting the rulebook, thinking about modifiers, trying to avoid rules mistakes... after more than 30 years I\xb4m not interested in these things any more. They turn me out of the game.<br/><br/>At best, rules don\xb4t want something from me, they inspire me. I love the way, some story games place emphasis on their themes by using simple, elementary rules with consequences. I\xb4m not able to name a "go-to system", but games I love at the moment are "Society of Dreamers", "Polaris", "Archipelago", "The clay that woke" and "Okult" (amongst others).<br/><br/>Problems solved (or at least reduced): thinking about rules instead of characters, streamlining the actions of characters in terms of the rules, levelling up the characters, calculate, consulting manuals, stay ingame.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475304/#Comment_475304" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-11T14:18:59+00:00" title="July 11, 2018  2:18PM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 11, 2018 2:22PM by Krippler.">edited July 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Apocalypse World</b> help structure low preparation games by the way threats and MC moves work.

After some reflection, I think the main problem it solved for me (initially) was how to make bad things happen to the PCs in a way that felt fair, non-arbitrary, and within some kind of rules framework, as well as in many cases avoiding un-fun PC deaths (as opposed to fun ones).<br/><br/>Example:<br/><br/>Basic D&amp;D: "The hobgoblin rushes towards you and [rolls dice] stabs you for 8 points of damage. You die."<br/><br/>Dungeon World: "The hobgoblin rushes towards you with its spear. What do you do?"<br/><br/>Soft moves before hard moves.<br/><br/>OTOH, I love the way that great D&amp;D stories emerge from the interaction of rules and fiction, in a way that is hard to replicate in other game systems. Something "clicks" in my brain when a player casts just the right spell to solve a fictional problem. It feels *legitimate* in a way that I feel can get lost in the improviness of story games.

Then I got introduced to games like Danger Patrol, Old School Hack, Apocalypse World, Dungeon World, and eventually World of Dungeons and it opened my eyes to other ways of running a game. <br/><br/>I quickly left behind the "simulate all the things!" mindset and realized that lighter was better for me. I didn't need to concern myself with all the nitty-gritty details; I had much more fun focusing on narrating cool stuff without having to reference the rules so much or parse events through heavily mechanized procedures. <br/><br/>Ultimately, what allowed me to make this transition was trust gained from being older and more mature. In short, my players trust that I'm not out to get them now, which means we don't have to rely on heavy amounts of mechanics to facilitate trusting play. In my experience, heavily mechanized "realistic" game systems are a result of mistrust between GM's and players, where everything dangerous must be filtered through a series of procedures designed to remove the decision-making process from humans at the table. <br/><br/>I now use a modified version of the PbtA "three-tiered results" system, along with the asymmetrical GM/player rules framework (moves) of PbtA, to run almost all of my games. Having to stop a smoothly narrated scene to break into "How many squares can I move?" kills the mood for me.<br/><br/>The flip side of this is: I love the traditional mode of play, with a strong GM authority and players with detailed character sheets who roll dice when they want to do stuff. Dice are important in my games; but I don't necessarily have to be the one rolling them. PbtA keeps all of the stuff I love about traditional games while removing the minutia that we don't need anymore.<br/><br/>All that being said, when a traditional RPG happens to produce a good story on accident, that's something cool and fun, simply because it happened by chance and not because we tried to make it happen that way. I definitely have stories of games that turned out that way, but they're the exception, not the rule. I just don't have time to wait for the exceptional experiences any more; I want to have a bit more of a hand in making things awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475418/#Comment_475418" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-16T22:41:13+00:00" title="July 16, 2018 10:41PM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the fact that the decision process is filtered through procedures.

This problem existed in AD&amp;D and it still exists now, judging by my son's high school D&amp;D experience of his monk spending the whole campaign following the war-forged around.  <br/><br/>2) GM challenges designing encounters -- this is related to, and feeds into, <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, because the GM needs to challenge the most effective character, which means that the less optimized character is even more screwed by having to fight tough monsters. And if things go in an unexpected direction and you have to run an unexpected encounter, you need to come up with stats for it in a hurry. <br/><br/>Both of these issues are greatly minimized in games like Apocalypse World, but also Buffy: the Vampire Slayer, where the character creation options do what they say on the tin and antagonists get minimal or no stats.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475428/#Comment_475428" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-17T04:20:57+00:00" title="July 17, 2018  4:20AM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            DannyK - to some extent those issues are "fixed" by OD&amp;D (or should I say "unbroken" or "not yet broken"...). Especially if you primarily stick to the original 3 LBB. Attributes aren't THAT important, mainly giving an experience bonus (which is easy to explain). Also, by not having all the unusual character classes, really every character type has a way to shine. And as far as encounters, the GM isn't responsible for scaling the encounters (except for a rough scaling by dungeon level). The players are responsible for choosing how to engage the encounter. And without unusual character type choices, the power levels of the characters are likely to be less divergent, so no one is going to really wimp out. Since I don't use Greyhawk weapon damage, weapon choice even isn't that important...<br/><br/>So actually, one of my reasons for returning to OD&amp;D 3 LBB was to "unbreak" things...<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475447/#Comment_475447" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-17T19:09:22+00:00" title="July 17, 2018  7:09PM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 17, 2018 7:25PM by Airk.">edited July 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you're just trading one kind of "brokenness" for another there.

Enough structure and creative constraint to allow people to step into the flow and enjoy their creative impulses, rather than being limited or paralyzed by a blank canvas.<br/><br/>The game's structure tells you what to do, and in what order, and you can just play.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed how <i>In a Wicked Age...</i>, for example, was a game you could play just by sitting down - everyone knew what the next step was, and you could just go through them and have a satisfying outcome.<br/><br/>I really enjoy making such procedures for games which are borderline, as well.
