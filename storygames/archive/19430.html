So here is the first idea that came to mind, inspired by this snippet from Jack Vance (below). It concerns Phandaal, a great and dark sorcerer who created many of the Spells which give magicians their power. \n<blockquote>The design of this mosaic we cannot surmise; our knowledge is didactic, empirical, arbitrary. Phandaal glimpsed the pattern and so was able to formulate many of the spells which bear his name. I have endeavored through the ages to break the clouded glass, but so far my research has failed. <br/><br/>At one time a thousand or more runes, spells, incantations, curses, and sorceries had been known. The reach of Grand Motholam--Ascolais, the Ide of Kauchique, Almery to the South, the Land of the Falling Wall to the East--swarmed with sorcerers of every description, of whom the chief was the Arch-Necromancer Phandaal. A hundred spells Phandaal personally had formulated--though rumor said that demons whispered at his ear when he wrought magic. Pontecilla the Pious, then ruler of Grand Motholam, put Phandall to torment, and after a terrible night, he killed Phandaal and outlawed sorcery throughout the land. The wizards of Grand Motholam fled like beetles under a strong light; the lore was dispersed and forgotten, until now, at this dim time, with the sun dark, wilderness obscuring Ascolais, and the white city Kaiin half in ruins, only a few more than a hundred spells remained to the knowledge of man.</blockquote>\nThe Earth, if it still exists, is dying, civilizations, philsophies, and races disappearing one after the other. Long ago, Phandaal, a sorcerer who dared open his mind to darker powers beyond our ken, glimpsed the end of the world that was coming, and saw that terrible end which faced humanity: Earth itself was in decline, all its inhabitants doomed to a slow and inevitable death.<br/><br/>He delved deeper into his forbidden studies, wrought powerful magics and forgotten crafts to build one or more greats Arcs (the accounts vary on this point), fantastic machines which could carry men, women, and beasts beyond the stars to other worlds. Alas, his exact plan is lost, for the jealousy of Pontecilla and other, lesser sorcerers led to his betrayal and bloody execution before he could reveal his true aims. In a panic, the people he had gathered ran to the Arcs and set them into motion, the machines following the plan Phandaal had designed but never explained to anyone living.<br/><br/>Now you are the descendant of one of these hapless passengers, far from the dying planet, with no knowledge of where you are or what you must do; a foreign world in some ways like what you have heard of old Earth, and in other ways utterly alien. What will you find here? Is there a way to learn Phandaal's lost arts, hidden in the Arc on which brought your people here, or did he intentionally seal you away from those dark sorceries? Is there a way to reawaken the Arc and return home to Earth, or is it your lot to make a new life here in this strange world?<br/><br/>Are there other Arcs out there, or was yours the only one? You begin your new life with so much uncertainty: what is behind you? Of what you know of the past, what is real, and what is myth, tales twisted by wicked, lying lips? Where do you find yourself, and have you arrived in this place by chance or according to Phandaal's plan?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432548/#Comment_432548" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-13T14:26:04+00:00" title="May 13, 2014  2:26PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To those reading along, Mike is interested in developing an unusual sort of successor to D&amp;D based around exploration.

You, the forth generation since the crash, have never experienced life outside the settlement that has survived against the odds all these years amidst the Jungle. Travellers have started appearing, wandering in exhausted through the mighty tress with strange tales of distant places and other settlements with their own pods. The Elders, their memories and secrets fast fading from the people with each year, sadly permit those who wish it to journey from their Village, out into the unknown wild to find the last of the Humans and perhaps build a better life together against the world's terrible dangers or even track down enough "Functioning Components" to solve the mystery of the pods and Return Home."</i></blockquote>\nBronze Age Sci-fi D&amp;D just about covers it. I like Paul's reconfiguring of the idea, but I'd be interested in other's conceptions. I was going for something more Nausicaa than Conan, but who knows?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432562/#Comment_432562" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-13T15:11:06+00:00" title="May 13, 2014  3:11PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>One thing you will want to consider for your game, I think, is an important question of procedure.

For instance, if the goal here is to challenge the players' problem-solving skills, clearly that cannot be done very easily if they know the solution to certain puzzles already, but their characters do not (this is tantamount to replaying a challenge for no apparent reason) - so you might have an established procedure for skipping through those challenges and effectively starting wherever the previous characters failed, for instance.<br/><br/>If one of the themes you wish to reinforce is mystery, unpredictability, and unreliable exploration, you may wish to, instead, have a procedure whereby the GM introduces twists into what is "remembered". Either the planet itself is full of surprises (if your islands are actually dormant giant tortoises that occasionally wake up and swim around, no one will be entirely surprised if a second voyage to find the island with the golden pond arrives at an altogether different island by mistake), or we take the 'memory' of the failed expedition as some kind of hearsay or unreliable account ("I heard that the sailors of the Nautilus were killed by a giant bird out there!"), and the players must proceed anew, uncertain of whether the challenges remain the same or not.<br/><br/>Does that make sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432567/#Comment_432567" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-13T17:21:56+00:00" title="May 13, 2014  5:21PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 13, 2014 5:22PM by GB_Steve.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There a nifty French game called Oltr\xe9e! about med-fan exploration of blank maps.

I was thinking that the terrain might be generated by starting on a 25-mile hex scale, defining general attributes of a region; a 5-mile hex to establish topology and then a 1-mile hex for features. I'd imagine overland travel by PCs would happen on the 5-mile scale with tactical manoeuvring on the 1-mile. Does that make sense? Drawing cards ("high mountains, east to west," "Rivers and lakes," "steppe grassland" etc) could be a way of generating ideas on the fly as the party moves.<br/><br/>The two key themes are Exploration and Community. The premise, however parsed, is meant to drive the players to be curious about uncovering information about their new world - to find out what's over the next ridge. It also implies a limited initial cast of PCs/NPCs who are all related in some way (the 4th generation from an initial group of, say, 15 survivors) going out to meet "foreigners" that PCs may have zero commonality with. What other human settlements might be like is incredibly variable I feel, and forging ties with these strangers should be an essential part of enabling exploration. The idea of all the PCs being siblings and cousins, possibly from different generations (perhaps generating a family tree at the start of play) sounds like a lot of fun. <br/><br/>Paul, I'm going to have to give some time to thinking over your questions.

Could be that, as it's a lot of hexcrawling, we're keeping close eye on the time it takes the party to figure something out first time so in the event that we're retreading ground covered by dead PCs we can just say "oh, this takes you 4 days like last time with 2 encounter rolls."
