How does it work throught a lot of differents situations.<br/><br/>For exemple in the game, you"ve got this : "i see two orcs" (i see / two orcs). Ok, so what is doing the DM now ? <br/><br/>- To create the ors, does he has to refer with the general rules about monsters creation, depending on their number/level/level of PC ?<br/><br/>- if it would have be "10 orcs" or 50 orcs, it would break this rules, unless you create weaker orcs, right ? So you would have to extend the rules for crafting monster, keeping in mind the idea of "balancing" the creatures.<br/><br/>- If it would have been a dragon, could you create a "level 2" Dragon (for level 1 players ) ? in this case, the standards values you've got to use for creation shouldn't be enough for a Dragon. How do you deal with that ( a ridiculously weak dragon ? ) ?<br/><br/>As usual, sorry for my broken english, i hope this is understandable                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Levine" title="Daniel Levine"><img alt="Daniel Levine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Levine">Daniel Levine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369619/#Comment_369619" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-28T06:46:40+00:00" title="March 28, 2012  6:46AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 28, 2012 6:50AM by Daniel Levine.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure I'm *100%* clear on your question - are you basically asking how to deal with player declarations that seem to be outside of the guidelines for creating NPCs and threats?  <br/><br/>If so, here's how I would handle the kinds of scenarios you suggest.  You may want to handle them differently, it's more of an art than a science.  I'm assuming you're in a level 1 chapter.<br/><br/>For the two orcs, yeah, I'd just stat up two level 1 orcs.  If that's too easy, well, the PC was pretty much asking for an easy challenge.<br/><br/>For 50 orcs, I would avoid making 50 super-weak orcs.  I might say, "OK, so the main group of orcs seems to be upping stakes and moving somewhere!  They send a squad of six orcs to slow you down while they continue on their way!"  So then they fight six orcs and we've added something weird and new - the orc pilgrimage - to the fiction. <br/><br/>For a dragon... that's a bit tough. With the group I ran Donjon for, I might just ask, "Really?  A dragon?  Like, not a dragonling or something?"  Remember that this doesn't have to be a guessing game - see the example on p. 47 (at least of my copy) of the GM and a player negotiating over whether a trapdoor in a swamp makes sense.  You can ask them if they really want there to be a dragon, and talk about the implications.<br/><br/>If they said, yeah, I might decide they asked for it and give them a dragon of some serious power level, regardless of the rules.  If I didn't feel that was appropriate, then I might try something like:<br/>- "The dragon would torch you if you tried to fight him.  But he wants to play a game of riddles!"  Stat up a riddle contest as a level 2 thing.<br/>- "The dragon is so huge only his left claw fits through the doorway!" Stat up "the dragon's claw" as a level 2 monster - if you defeat it, the dragon flies away holding its bleeding hand and hates you for later.<br/>- The numbers are all relative.  Who says level 2 is weak?  Maybe level 2 is enough to level a whole village, and level 10 monsters are, like, dragon gods.  Think of the difference between the power of a level 2 D&amp;D4E PC vs. a level 2 Old-School D&amp;D PC.<br/><br/>But in general, it might help to explain that, in a game like Donjon, you and the players are *collaborating* to create appropriate challenges.  If the players want to break the game, they can - at least certainly to the point of making the game disjointed or un-fun.  If they're throwing "50 orcs!" at you as a sort of stump-the-GM move, it's not likely to work very well.  They should be thinking, do we want dragons to be level 2 threats?  Does that kind of fiction make sense to us?  Is it fun?  Because they have as much say over whether or not a level 2 dragon is ridiculous as you do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369634">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369634/#Comment_369634" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-28T07:41:06+00:00" title="March 28, 2012  7:41AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Monster Encounters should be at the appropriate level for the DonJon.  If a player wants to "see" a Dragon, that's perfectly fine.  They "saw" it.<br/><br/>Now the GM has the power, the potential, and the responsibility to take what the players declare and twist it.  Maybe it's a Dragon that has minions, and the PCs fight the minions now.  Maybe it's an illusion of a Dragon cast by that sensible little Level 2 Kobold.  Maybe it's a Hex meant to scare people away from some treasure.  Maybe it's a beautiful young woman dressed in a Dragon suit for some naughty cos-play.  Who knows?  The GM.<br/><br/>It's hard to play DonJon if you take things too literally.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maitresinh" title="Maitresinh"><img alt="Maitresinh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maitresinh">Maitresinh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369804/#Comment_369804" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-28T15:51:07+00:00" title="March 28, 2012  3:51PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks. it seems obvious now<br/><br/>But i think i'm going to reformulate it \xe0 la "Vincent baker" like this<br/><br/>DM jobs<br/><br/>-&gt; negociate with your players<br/>-&gt; twist their facts, to adapt them<br/>- &gt;add to and complete their fact.<br/>etc...<br/><br/>Regarding monster's creation : <br/><br/>-&gt; keep allways the balance<br/><br/>Some solutions in case of problems<br/><br/>if too numerous: <br/><br/>* just a few of them are fighting<br/><br/>if too powerfull: <br/><br/>* avoid the confrontation (the creature don't see them)<br/>* twist it: a dragonlet instead of a dragon<br/><br/>etc...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369852/#Comment_369852" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-28T19:30:32+00:00" title="March 28, 2012  7:30PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really liked that thing about fighting just the one claw - very God of War-esque, as in the part where he fights...
