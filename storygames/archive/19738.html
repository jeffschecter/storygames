I've been bombarding my social media outlets but neglecting my old forums.<br/><br/>Anyway, my game of giant mecha and emotionally unstable teenagers is out as a fully narrated synchronized-text book. And it's free! When I created the kickstarter for <i>Tears of a Machine</i> I promised that in the spirit of accessibility I would make ePub and DAISY versions of the book that will display the book text onscreen as it is read by (my) recorded voice. <br/><br/>Why? Well because the textbook style presentation of most RPGs limits our audience! I've worked 14 years with an organization that serves the dyslexic population. Dyslexia is more common that people think. There are willing players out there who are held back from enjoying our hobby because print is a barrier and the social stigma of dyslexia leaves them afraid to ask for help. Dyslexics aren't "stupid!" They need their information delivered through a different medium and synchronized audio is one of the best channels we have.<br/><br/>You'll find all the details on <a href="http://www.robotclaw.info" rel="nofollow">robotclaw.info</a>. There are links at the bottom of the front page to get the accessible versions and free playback software. There are also blog entries that track the process of text to audio book, step-by-step.<br/><br/>Even if you don't get to play it, please check it out and share it with friends or relatives who you think would be well served by the accessible format. If you are comfortable to do so, share your thoughts with me through one channel or another. If you do get to play it then let me see those AP's of pilots blasting alien robots and failing math class because of the butterflies in their stomach when their crush walks by. <br/><br/>The book is also available in traditional print and PDF offerings and is on sale until Sept. 15th. It's a good way to show silent support for this and my future accessible game projects.<br/><br/>PER SCIENTIAM VICTORIA!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438107/#Comment_438107" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-04T11:14:50+00:00" title="September  4, 2014 11:14AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is great, Russell.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438108/#Comment_438108" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-04T12:47:23+00:00" title="September  4, 2014 12:47PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome, I love that you put in the effort to do this so much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RussellCollins" title="RussellCollins"><img alt="RussellCollins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RussellCollins">RussellCollins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438136/#Comment_438136" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-06T13:03:01+00:00" title="September  6, 2014  1:03PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks!<br/><br/>It's been a lot of work and still isn't perfect (some wonky volume levels in the middle of a marathon recording session.) I think it's a good demonstration for other designers, about what can be done to add an accessible option to your work and it was all done with free and open source tools.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
