And this is why-- I heard computer game designer Ken Levine (System Shock 2, Bioshock) say in an interview that all of us have that fantasy world in our head that we have been designing since 7th grade. Then he said words to the effect of "No one else wants to hear any of those details <i>unless they make the game better.</i>" Similarly, I remember vividly a podcast with Chad Underkoffler where he admitted that he had thousands of words of setting background for <b>Swashbucklers of the Seven Skies</b> that he discarded because it didn't meet his criteria of immediately suggesting new awesome ways and ideas to play the game. So after hearing these two great designers say basically the same thing, I decided that was a pretty good standard to hold myself to. But what are your methods for writing good material?<br/><br/>Some good examples of effective background-- To me the best would probably be John Harper. In <a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/ladyblackbird/" rel="nofollow">Lady Blackbird</a> he paints an entire setting in a few sentences and pictures. Every time I've played LB, I see new players launch into reveries of delighted speculation from just two words (Sky Squid). Another standout is Will Hindmarch's <a href="http://gameplaywright.net/2010/03/alien-survivor-v0-9/" rel="nofollow">Alien Survivor</a>. The idea to include little descriptive phrases, often associated with the different senses, to convey the world ("So cold there are icicles growing where the shadows strike the pavement") is such a good idea that I've tried to have a stock of such phrases at hand for my own games.<br/><br/>Some bad examples: The worst I can remember was an early 90s Twilight 2000 module. I don't think it was from GDW, rather from a licensed contractor. It had dozens or pages of meaningless, trite, tendentious, self-involved history of the gang problem in post-apocalyptic Boston-- nothing that couldn't have been conveyed in a sentence or two. Other bad examples-- well I guess we could all name plenty of them.<br/><br/>Finally, I'd like to offer my own work for criticism. Here is an introduction I wrote today for an upcoming Zombie Apocalypse game where the goal is to escape from Seattle. How good a job am I doing? How can I do better? Can it be shorter? I know there are a lot of Seattle people here on SG, do I capture the place? Conversely, for the Europeans and others who don't know the area, do you get the feeling of what the game's themes will be? Is this enough setting material? If anyone else wants to share their own efforts here as well, please feel free.<br/><br/><i>The emerald cities sat close together, feet in the water, their backs to the mountains. It used to be the prettiest and most populated part of the state. Now the whole western side of the Cascades is a death trap. You can't flee to the north or south-- just more urban centers stretching away in both directions from Portland to the Canadian border, all exploding with Infected. Before the radios stopped working, they said the main route through to the East was blockaded by military units rushed in from Yakima. Even if that weren't true, Snoqualmie pass would be too crowded. But locals know there is another way out. Higher and more remote than the main interstate, highway (SR?) xx curves xx miles through a long narrow valley that climbs steeply up to Stevens Pass. The turbulent green xx river runs next to the roadway for most of that trip, and this place is still the primary railroad line into and out of the region. A string of small pretty towns with quaint names (Sultan, Gold Bar, Index, Startup) hosted tourists, wintersports enthusiasts and white-water rafters. At the top of the pass was a ski resort. Beyond that, a steep descent into the replica Bavarian village of Leavenworth, and from there on to the dry, desert part of Washington. On the other side of Stevens Pass there is a lightly populated, food producing  region rich with farms, ranches, hills and wilderness. A place where you might finally find a safe haven, if you can get there.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382429/#Comment_382429" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-15T10:01:29+00:00" title="June 15, 2012 10:01AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You need to sow lots of seeds.

They've become a shrinking, gray-brown stain on the mountains, who wait for them to wash down to the sea.  This used to be the heartland, the prettiest and most populated part of the state.  Now that heart is getting eaten away: To west, over the Cascades, and to the north or south urban centers from Portland to Canada... all of it is exploding with the Infected.

If they are still people there - maybe they can help.  Beyond that, there's that creepy replica Bavarian village, and if you're lucky you can make it to the dry, desert part of Washington.  I hear the Infected don't last long there, maybe the dry air kills them, maybe they wear out. On the other side of Stevens Pass there is supposed to be farm country; hills and wilderness.

Finding a balance between "show" and "tell" isn't always the easiest task.  However, when you say things like "exploding with [the] infected," I get how dangerous it is.  That's a good example of a metaphor that really captures the setting very well.  If you can add in some solid metaphors, I think the description will be stronger.  Remember, you want to capture a dire mood!<br/><br/>2.)  One thing I think could be REALLY cool would be to alter the perspective from which we hear this description.  For your setting, I think it could be amazing if the whole thing was narrated by someone who is from beyond Stevens Pass, on the throes of death, trying to guide the survivors safely away.<br/><br/>~Klaus                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w176" title="w176"><img alt="w176" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/649/nZVYYAKMQQQR6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w176">w176</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382440/#Comment_382440" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-15T11:58:46+00:00" title="June 15, 2012 11:58AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the key words to understand what is effective, is effect and affect.

It's a short story, almost microfiction, that I used as the "lore" for something I ran back in 2009.  I wanted to capture the harshness of the desert where everyone was, and this story seemed to do that well:<br/><br/>As the white sun rose in the east, a group of acolytes gathered by their master\u2019s fountain.  Fed from a meager spring, the water flowed only briefly at dawn.  If no water was collected, it would return untouched to the spring and await the coming of the next day.  By strict custom, no one would draw from the fountain until the master had arrived.<br/><br/>The acolytes mused on scripture for sometime, awaiting their master\u2019s arrival, but to no avail.  Dawn was coming to a close and soon the water would slow to a trickle and then vanish for the remainder of the day.  The young acolytes were thirsty, and they grew uneasy, when the youngest boldly drew a pitcher of water from the fountain.  His companions, aghast, took the pitcher in anger and poured it upon bleak earth.<br/><br/>It was then that the master arrived.  He scowled and summoned the youngest to his side.  Exalting the youngest one\u2019s courage, he scolded the rest.<br/><br/>\u201cWhat privilege is borne in this desert that allows you to waste even a single drop of water?  The well shall flow again, but the water you have spilled is wasted for all time.  Had I died in my sleep, would you fall victim to tradition and perish from thirst?
