The game is a big 'maybe' at the moment, and probably won't happen at all, but I've got some design goals and I can never resist thinking about mechanics.<br/><br/>So I've got this thing I've been contemplating, called Metaphors. Basically, the GM can set up a Metaphor for a relationship, for an emotion, for someone's happiness, or similar. F'rex (is it still hip to say that?), my character is setting up a play of some sort. The GM now establishes the play as a Metaphor for my relationship with Katarina. So if our relationship suffers, the play suffers, and vice versa. I like these things in stories, and it seems like a cool tool to get some subtle storytelling going (I don't have to tell everyone that my relationship with Katarina is in a bad state; it's enough that I have a scene where I argue with the actors) and let details like plays, fashion, masque balls, music and paintings become important.<br/><br/>The thing I'm worrying about, though, is stretching the credibility where everyone suddenly starts caring about this play I set up, because they want to save or spoil my relationship with Katarina. What do you guys think? This game is nowhere near playtest ready (this is more or less all there is), and it might not happen at all, but I like this mechanism. Will it stretch credibility? If so, what can I do to fix that?<br/><br/>I've got a few ideas, but I want to hear what you have to say first.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meserach" title="Meserach"><img alt="Meserach" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meserach">Meserach</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168347/#Comment_168347" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-10T13:40:42+00:00" title="September 10, 2008  1:40PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are characters in the fiction aware of the Metaphor status of things?

This sort of close coupling of otherwise (seemingly) unrelated things befits a land of dreams or faeries or gods. It's just too surreal, to my mind, to take this coupling--more so, the awareness of it by the characters--into any kind of "realistic" or historical setting. Sure, with this example (play = relationship) you can come up with "logical" reasons the characters would think impacting the play impacts the relationship (see above).<br/><br/>But suppose we couple, oh, a small garden plot and the Swedish King? Perfectly valid metaphor in literature--as the plot blooms, ripens, and eventually fades, we readers can see a similar, resonant arc in the King's health or reign or love life or whatever. But in an interactive fiction, where the characters themselves know/see that coupling? I fear you'd get a comedy of errors, as assassins poison rutabagas and diplomats help weed the tomato rows and courtiers... uh, wax the cucumbers?

Nothing actually magical or anything (I hate the old "... except with magic!" cliche), but the castles will be bigger, the drama more dramatic, the snow colder, the love more passionate and the shit shittier. This'll be the rapier duels on the cathedral roof in thunderstorm, intriguing ladies in revealing corsets, disguised servants recruiting prostitutes, burning jealousy, self-destructive pride, passionate love, debauchery, decadence, masque balls, sweet perfume and cold steel kind of 18th century. Larger-than-life. Dramatic. And I think that the method is well suited for that.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, the "assassins poison rutabagas" problem is exactly what I was afraid of. But if I make sure that there has to be a connection in the fiction, this would mean that you <i>couldn't</i> make a connection between the garden and the king, unless there could be such a connection in the actual fiction. Wouldn't that help lessen the problem?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I have some ideas regarding system. The way I'm thinking at the moment (this hasn't been entirely thought through, much less playtested), there will be quite a limited number of things you can actually do. An assassin won't be able to poison the rutabagas, because that's not part of his abilities. However, he could convince/threaten/bribe/entice/seduce/force/fool the gardener into doing it. Now it's the gardener doing the poisoning, and there's also an established in-fiction connection (maybe the garden is the place where the queen is buried, and it's very important to the king's happiness that it looks beautiful), doesn't that make enough sense for a historical-but-overly-dramatic story?<br/>\n<br/>\nOr does anyone have any more ideas?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168519/#Comment_168519" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-11T13:16:56+00:00" title="September 11, 2008  1:16PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "if the linkage goes both ways, the two things are functionally the same thing.

It certainly has presence in fiction already, and I totally think that screwing with the play to screw with the relationship should be a goal rather than to be avoided.<br>\n<br>\nAnyway hope that helped. <br>\n<br>\nLogos                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_168529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy" title="DeBracy"><img alt="DeBracy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nTIWP6SSS5BV3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy">DeBracy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168529/#Comment_168529" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-11T14:04:53+00:00" title="September 11, 2008  2:04PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First of, great idea. I'm a sucker for this stuff and give three thumbs up for any attempt to bring a little more poetic touch into gaming. Also: credibility? That stuff is for Star Trek fans (no offence, guys). The times of the Theatre King demands no credibility!<br/><br/>Now, to get to my actual point... When I've been thinking about this relationship I really couldn't help but seeing two scenes in front of me. One is quite simply Katarina being shot by the man setting up the play (which of course is a huge success after all but it's not something he'll be able to enjoy)... the other scene is basically the reverse - the theatre/opera is burned to the ground just days before the premiere. Again, it's the man with the play who's the perpetrator but in this one he somehow gets Katarina. I'm not sure exactly why, apart from the fact that the whole thing comes down to sacrificing one for the other.<br/><br/>I don't really know what I'm getting at here, more just throwing it out there. I'm quite fond of sacrifices, it's often a very effective tool to up the drama. I know it might be a very rough fit with the whole metaphor thing but think it over - shooting the one you love or burning an opera are pretty cool things to do.

This sort of close coupling of otherwise (seemingly) unrelated things befits a land of dreams or faeries or gods. It's just too surreal, to my mind, to take this coupling--more so, the awareness of it by the characters--into any kind of "realistic" or historical setting. Sure, with this example (play = relationship) you can come up with "logical" reasons the characters would think impacting the play impacts the relationship (see above).</blockquote>\nIt's been done many times as a-play-within-the-play. But it would work just as well if it were a shared dream world, jockeying for position in the king's court through indirect means (parties, gossip, fashion, etc.), the telling of stories (like 1001 Nights), or a meta-game like the gods playing chess with people's lives.<br/><br/>But I think you would want to limit it to two game worlds running in parallel - with the players competing in both and the result in one explicitly linked to an attribute bonus of some kind in the other (rather than linked both ways). For example, for the more realistic example of courtly intrigue, throwing a lavish party might give you a die of King's Favor that you could use in any other situation you wanted (and the actual effects of which could be easily described if necessary).<br/><br/>For the play-within-a-play scenario, it would work in a similar manner, but at a dramatic level that doesn't need to be explained: a character whose counterpart in the internal play is successful in some way would receive a bonus of some kind in the "real" world. For example, if a character within the play seduced someone, it might lead to the corresponding outer character receiving a bonus die that could be used on his or her next personal interaction with the opposite sex. In this case, you'd probably want to exaggerate the action in the internal play as much as possible (murder might only signify a drastic reversal of fortune - or an attribute going to zero temporarily).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_168585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168585/#Comment_168585" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-11T22:15:34+00:00" title="September 11, 2008 10:15PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2008 10:15PM by Simon_Pettersson.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Logos7</cite>Its a nifty little idea, I'm not sure the word you want is metaphor, it kinda threw me at the begining, this sounds a lot more like entanglement or something (A and B are linked for little or no reason) rather than a metaphor (A is a model for B in a certain sense).</blockquote>\nGood point.

It works in the specific example of the play and Katarina, but what about, for example, the king and the garden? Killing the king to save the garden? Thanks for the idea, though. I've been thinking of having ways to sacrifice one thing to help another character. This leads me to believe it's a good thing to have in the game. So I could sacrifice my play to save Katarina. That would be a different thing than this mechanic, though. This mechanic would mean that I sacrifice the play and at the same time my relationship with Katarina (since they're Entangled), to save her.

But if I'm the GM, I'm not the assassin. The GM will be quite impartial here. The adversity will all be PvP. The assassin would be a player, or hired by a player, and what I worried about is the player going on a rutabaga poisoning spree. But I think that as long as there's a solid connection in the fiction, the player would simply hire a gardener instead, and it's alright.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Number6intheVillage</cite><br/>It's been done many times as a-play-within-the-play.

You're at least now thinking of actual handling and interpretation of a general system element, in play.

You know: don't front-load it and come up with all the "valid modes" to cause an entangling of actions and results, across the connection. Rather, a form of player-to-player(-to-GM) negotiation could be a BIG and fun part of the play, as you literally define the meaning and effects of entanglement on a case-by-case basis (task-by-task; conflict-by-conflict).<br/><br/>I'll be watching out for this one!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168753/#Comment_168753" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-12T14:41:59+00:00" title="September 12, 2008  2:41PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very cool!<br/><br/>I suggest you call them "mirrors". <br/><br/>I really like the "sacrifice" option tied into the equation.<br/><br/>For instance, it could be set up like this:<br/><br/>The two situations influence each other, but are not necessarily the same. So, perhaps, the actions of other players affect both "mirrors", but your own actions can only affect one "mirror" at a time. So, your play and your Katarina might both improve because of good influences, but you still have to choose which one you want to concentrate on more. If you're lucky, both might do well.<br/><br/>In addition, if one of the mirrors gets close to losing it--the show is about to fail or you are about to lose the girl--maybe you can sacrifice one to get a bonus to getting the other one. But it only makes sense to sacrifice the one that is in better shape. For instance, things are going well with the play, but your relationship with Katarina is slipping, and is about to disintegrate completely. You can sacrifice the play to get a bonus or a second chance to get the relationship to work.<br/><br/>In this way, you can get four possibilities (both succeed, both fail, one succeeds and one fails). I don't know if that undermines your whole premise, or if it sounds interesting.<br/><br/>Hopefully that gives someone some ideas.<br/><br/>This whole metaphor idea can be played as a figurative literary sort of thing (perhaps with connections made at random!), or more like something reminiscent of "Say Yes or Face the Dungeon": you want to achieve some goal in the fiction, and you use some metaphor for that goal to carry out your attempt.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_168811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage" title="Number6intheVillage"><img alt="Number6intheVillage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.johnkantor.com/miscl/prisoner_ringtiny.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage">Number6intheVillage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168811/#Comment_168811" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-12T18:34:16+00:00" title="September 12, 2008  6:34PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 12, 2008 6:34PM by Number6intheVillage.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But I want to see a system that can handle that.

It feels just right. As an added boon, when you talk about sacrificing one of the two, you can talk about "breaking the mirrors". That's cool.<br/><br/>Some more about the system: I'm planning to keep it diceless, similarly to Nobilis. Either you do a thing, or you don't. You dont fail to do things, but you can be stopped by some other player interfering. There will, most likely, be a mechanic for sacrifice. If someone's doing something you don't want to happen, you can sacrifice something to stop it from happening. But you don't start with things you can sacrifice -- you have to win them through play, and there'll be different bonuses attached to them. For example, you can, through play, earn a Mark of True Love. That'll give you immense power to help the person you love, and it's also a thing you can sacrifice.<br/><br/>So all I need to do to connect this to the Mirror mechanic, is to say that you can sacrifice one part of a Mirror that contains an aspect of yourself or a relationship with you (like the Mirror between the play and my relationship with Katarina) to save the other, and this breaks the Mirror. Cool!<br/><br/>Another cool thing with this mechanic is that you'll get into situations like this: A is friends with B. A is threatened with some horrible thing by an action from C. A doesn't have anything to sacrifice, so there's no escape. Except ... B has a Mark of True Love. He can sacrifice his relationship with his beloved, or let his friend suffer this horrible fate. How's that  for drama?<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Hmm, I just realized a possible issue, though. If I can always sacrifice one part of a Mirror to save the other, then the point of Mirrors sort of disappears, doesn't it? There's a Mirror between the play and my relationship with Katarina, so another player ruins the play to destroy my relationship with Katarina. I sacrifice the play to save my relationship, and all the other player managed to accomplish is to ruin the play, somthing he didn't care much about. It invalidates the purpose of the Mirror, as you can no longer ruin one to ruin the other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage" title="Number6intheVillage"><img alt="Number6intheVillage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.johnkantor.com/miscl/prisoner_ringtiny.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage">Number6intheVillage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168859/#Comment_168859" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-13T08:55:39+00:00" title="September 13, 2008  8:55AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Depends on how easy it is to create those mirror relationships.

But if the choice is to either let the play and my relationship with Katarina be destroyed, or "just" the play, there's no reason I shouldn't take just the play every time.If I don't do anything, my enemy will destroy the play. Because there's a mirror relationship, this will also destroy my relationship with Katarina. However, if there's the choice to sacrifice the play to save Katarina, then there is no reason I shouldn't take that route. My enemy knows this, so he probably won't attack the play in the first place, since he knows it won't destroy my relationship with Katarina, anyway. And thus, the mechanic fails to perform its duty. Sucks.\n<blockquote>You talked about not wanting "magic" - but the way it's working doesn't seem to be very different from magical correspondence.</blockquote>\nThe difference is that there's no special connection in the fiction (just the regular connection you need to specify when setting up the Mirror). It's just a narrative thing. If my play fails, my relationship won't fail because of some magical force or other. It'll fail because Katarina sees me as a failure, or because I, in my last efforts to save the play, ignore her, or because of some other reason. Hell, it doesn't even have do have anything to do with the play. Maybe she leaves me for another guy. There's no magic in the game world -- it's all in the system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168893/#Comment_168893" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-13T16:15:19+00:00" title="September 13, 2008  4:15PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the key would be something like this:<br/><br/>Sacrificing one side of the mirror only makes sense as a last resort. For instance, gameplay is about players trying to get two things into play, each reinforcing the other. Sacrifice is only an option when you _know_ that you're about to lose one or both.<br/><br/>What if those mirrors were connecting different characters? Like, my play is a mirror for <i>your</i> relationship with Katarina.<br/><br/>This could get interesting! Let's say we see these sacrifices as a resource to be spent in conflicts, as a last resort:<br/><br/>You sacrifice something to preserve something else, but that action brings about misery for a third character. But your opponent really wants your thing to go down in flames, so she sacrifices something of hers to stay even with you--but now someone else's life has gotten really messed up. That could create some interesting relationship maps and communities in crisis...<br/><br/>Characters with numerous connections would have tremendously high stakes in any conflict--any sacrifices made could potentially lead to a chain reaction that destroys both characters utterly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_168981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168981/#Comment_168981" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-14T11:44:19+00:00" title="September 14, 2008 11:44AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, Paul.
