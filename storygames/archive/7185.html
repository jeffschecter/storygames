It was wildly fun and a bit moving, too.<br/><br/>Ben Robbins was the (amazing) GM.<br/><br/>In the first game we had:<br/>- Corporal Syphon (played by Ryan)<br/>- Sgt. Benito Cabral (played by John)<br/><br/>Cabral and Syphon exited the landing craft with their squad (NPCs Miller, Esche, Dvorak, and Bure) on the planet of Narcissus. It was a beach planet. Turquoise oceans, white sand, cool breezes. Another glorious day in the corps!<br/><br/><b>Sgt. Cabral</b> (over radio): "Control, 42 Echo Six Actual reporting planetfall at grid marker Hotel niner Kilo seven three stroke five, over."<br/><b>Control:</b> "42 Echo, Control. Drop point confirmed. Move to Hill Bravo Six One Four, anticipate light resistance, copy."<br/><b>Sgt. Cabral:</b> "Control, 42 Echo Six Actual. Moving to Hill Bravo Six One Four, light resistance expected, out." (to the troops) "Alright, bugfuckers, let's move out. Everyone keep your dicks dry."<br/><br/>And with that, it was on. The squad met "light resistance" from the xenos as we started up the hill. In other words, a swarm of needle-toothed, killer starfish things exploded out of the sand and proceeded to attempt to crack us out of our armor and eat the soft parts inside. We lost Bure. He had a good singing voice and will be missed. (Ben ruled that whenever we, the PCs, took a hit, one of our NPC squad mates -- there for color only -- would die)<br/><br/>Corporal Syphon fooled around with grenades, exploding starfish left and right, narrowly missing his squad mates. Cabral (Reputation: "By the book") dressed him down for improper usage of high explosives while in close contact with the enemy, but Syphon did his best Private Hudson impersonation and shrugged it off.<br/><br/><b>Cabral:</b> "Corporal, the Expeditionary Forces have invested over 4 million credits in your training, not to mention the training and equipment of your squad mates. Unlike your personality, looks, or breeding, this expenditure of resources gives your sorry life some value. Please treat the investment of the Expeditionary Forces with more respect in the future, or, at the very least, find a more distant site at which to blow yourself up."<br/><br/>The game system is super fast, intuitive, and colorful. It does a very good job providing the razor-edge balance between "tough but fair" and "doomed." You feel death right around the corner all the time, but there's a chance that you just might make it. It's a cool feeling, which adds nicely to the vibe of the game. This holds true for all the mechanics, as it turns out.<br/><br/>More to come...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_160019">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160019/#Comment_160019" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-31T02:05:27+00:00" title="July 31, 2008  2:05AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 31, 2008 2:05AM by Ben_Robbins.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>"Everyone keep your dicks dry."</blockquote>\nI don't want to spoil the surprise, but this will be a recurring theme in the 42e.\n<blockquote>(Ben ruled that whenever we, the PCs, took a hit, one of our NPC squad mates -- there for color only -- would die)</blockquote>\nActually it was only when the PCs went to Crippled that we narrated an NPC death, not just the first hit.

Don't make rolls for the NPCs or change the threat tokens or anything like that, just let the PC results reflect the outcome of the whole battle.

All players are encouraged to chime in if they think of things to add. Remember all complaints about the GM will go in your permanent record and affect chances of future promotion.<br/><br/>Game 1 -- the Sevastopol Missions<br/><br/>players -- John Harper (Sergeant Cabral 6/4) and Ryan Dunleavy (Corporal Syphon 7/3)<br/><br/><b>Planet 1: NARCISSUS</b><br/><br/>As John already covered the expeditionary force drops and charges out onto beautiful beaches and slaughters waves of small starfish-ball critters. It's a full-planet press on paradise, with different task forces landing all over the globe and seizing the rare points of dry ground.<br/><br/>I intentionally made this a quick intro planet. I had no idea how long a planet would take and wanted to give the players a chance to try out post-mission development so I ran it with only half the normal threat.<br/><br/>In the climactic battle the squad and all the other units in the area are called to rush to the support of a major engagement. They find hundreds of troopers laying down fire on a whale-like creature a kilometer long, wallowing in the shallow sea and singing a sorrowful song of pain as lasebeams and rocketpods rake it from the shore. Starfish-balls burrow up out of the sand and skitter out of the surf, trying to overwhelm the soldiers and perhaps defend the helpless leviathan. That's where we lose Trooper Syphon. In the immortal words of Sgt. Cabral:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>On planet Narcissus, we're under attack by killer starfish. Corporal Syphon is throwing grenades and killing them by the dozens until he gets dragged down and they swarm all over his armor, cracking it open with their needle-like teeth bits. "My legendary calm is gone!" Ryan, the player, laments. Syphon decides to pull the pins on all his grenades and shoot up with his combat drugs at the same time. What could go wrong?</blockquote>\nYes, as described elsewhere, Ryan chucked grenades at Close range, missed, saw that the collateral damage would kill him, used his combat drugs to reroll FA but then rolled a 10, which mean he took damage from the drug overdose (killing him) and _then_ got blown up by his own grenades (killing him again). It was, sadly, his only kill of the mission.<br/><br/>Soon Narcissus is pacified and the Alien Threat eliminated (no chance those whales will ever build spaceships now!). With only two players both would automatically level, but instead Corporal Syphon gets a fine military burial on a nice sandy beach -- at least the parts they can find.<br/><br/><i>post-mission:</i><br/>\tSergeant Cabral - 13 kills, raises NFA (6/5)<br/>\tCorporal Syphon - 1 kill (yes, only himself)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_162947">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162947/#Comment_162947" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-18T04:17:26+00:00" title="August 18, 2008  4:17AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, before I get back to this much-delayed actual play I have to point out something really cool John did at GenCon.<br/><br/>To slake the desire for xenocidal marine mayhem, John ran some sessions of 3:16 for those poor souls who hadn't gotten to try it -- many, many sessions as it turned out.<br/><br/>To start with he ran the same planets I GM'ed for him at mini-GPNW, sending the poor space marines down to Narcissus and later Daisy and even the dreaded Juniper.<br/><br/>But the _clever_ part is that instead of just running the same missions for different groups, he changed them so that each squad was participating in different facets of the battle to take those planets.<br/><br/>And as the final glorious touch, he ran it so that his games also worked with the original games he played in the first place. So something like three different squads of marines have fought in different theaters of Daisy (so far), including the one led by his own Sgt. Cabral -- it's all one big happy fleet.<br/><br/>Who knows how many more untold stories there could be of other squads fighting at the same time in other parts of the world? So long as no one has access to starkillers you could go back and run new groups fighting for different parts of the same planets ad infinitum.<br/><br/>I love it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_162949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162949/#Comment_162949" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-18T04:57:13+00:00" title="August 18, 2008  4:57AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread is useless without pictures.<br/><br/>^_____^                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_162965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162965/#Comment_162965" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-18T07:56:12+00:00" title="August 18, 2008  7:56AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds fantastic, Ben.<br/>\nOf course we can't reproduce that experience without planet/mission writeups... ;)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_163102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163102/#Comment_163102" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-18T17:44:16+00:00" title="August 18, 2008  5:44PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 18, 2008 5:45PM by John_Harper.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The GenCon 3:16 runs were so very fun.

We get to see the nice benefit of fast character generation in 3:16 as Ryan whips up his new guy (Trooper Seven, 7/3) in minutes flat. Technically he probably should have come in as Corporal but it felt right to let him earn his return to rank.<br/><br/><b>Planet 2: DAISY</b><br/><i>"daaaiissyyy, daaaiisssyyy... givvvee meeee youuuuurr answerrrrrrr duuuuuuue..."</i><br/><br/><b><i>The Briefing</i></b><br/>Most expeditionary forces are busy sweeping Continent One, but intel showed potential heavy resistance on Continent Two, so Command ordered a groundpounder fusion bomb to soften opposition (read as: glass the continent) before sending in ground forces.<br/><br/>The weapon made a controlled descent but then failed to detonate or respond to further commands. It's too risky to launch a full-scale assault into the impact zone of an undetonated fusion weapon, so the weapon has to be found and either repaired or decommissioned so it poses no threat to friendlies. Squad 42e is one of a handful of units sent to find the bomb and escort the technical team that will deal with it. None of them will have much backup since they're the only troops on Two. Good luck.<br/><br/>During the briefing the weapon was casually refered to as a smartbomb, but eager for kills John and Ryan didn't seem to think it was an important detail. Oh the irony.<br/><br/><b><i>The Search</i></b><br/>As the drop pod doors open, the troops see that Daisy's terrain is soft, marshy ground covered in dark bamboo-like forests creeping with mist -- a wonderful place to do a ground search. The squads spread out to their assigned search grids, combing the area around the estimated landing point of the bomb.<br/><br/>Squad 42e is slogging along when suddenly one of the [NPC] troopers is jerked off his feet and reeled up into the air, screaming and flailing. That's when the squad realizes they are walking directly _beneath_ a pack of lurking aliens, their spindly 20 meter legs blending in quite nicely with the surrounding bamboo shafts (special power: Ambush). The aliens are tripod-like, the legs stalks coming together in a bulbous downward gazing amber eye surrounded by small tendrils that snap out and snag prey, pulling them up into the liquid membrane of the eye where it gets absorbed and digested (yes, they eat with their eyes).<br/><br/>It's a nasty fight (particularly after the free ambush damage) but Cabral and Seven get the job done. At one point one of the alien tendrils reaches down and fiddles with a fallen slug rifle, almost like it's examining it, giving the troopers the uneasy feeling the striders might be smarter than they look, before they blow it to alien hell.<br/><br/>Meanwhile comm is burning up with reports of fighting from other units and desperate requests for help. Squad 42e double-times to assist but they're too late -- the technical team is slaughtered along with the squads protecting them.<br/><br/>They find one soldier, Trooper Parsons, who survived the attack but is out of his mind with panic. Sgt. Cabral tries to calm him down (NFA check) but fails, finally pointing his pistol at the trooper's head and threatening to shoot if he doesn't get his shit together -- no dice. If they bring him along his babbling will give away their position and jeopardize the mission. As the rest of the squad watches Sgt. Cabral gives the trooper one last chance... then shoots him in the face.<br/><br/>They salvage what equipment they can from the technical team, not sure they'll be able to make heads or tails of it even if they find the bomb, and then move out to continue their search.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_163191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163191/#Comment_163191" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-19T06:34:29+00:00" title="August 19, 2008  6:34AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 21, 2008 5:22AM by Ben_Robbins.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>(Daisy continued)</i><br/><br/><b><i>The Objective</i></b><br/>Once they get near it the bomb is easy to find: it's as big as a truck, sitting in the middle of a muddy clearing flattened by the landing thrusters.<br/><br/>Sarge sends a trooper to recon but when he gets near the bomb he starts pointing his rifle around nervously, then hightails it back to the approaching unit. "There's somebody down there! I heard somebody talking -- maybe one of the tech guys made it here?"<br/><br/>The squad approaches cautiously but is brought up short by a terse "Intruders! Identify yourselves or I will activate security protocols!" A moment of confusion follows before the our heroes realize that the bomb itself is talking. Yes, that's right: a smart, bomb.<br/><br/>Discussion ensues. The bomb explains (in a nasal, pusillanimous voice) that this target is clearly an unworthy objective that doesn't merit its detonation. How is it going to look on its military record if it kills a handful of aliens blowing up some backwater wilderness? It wants to get in touch with command and be reassigned, saving itself for some nice juicy urban center, except atmospherics have prevented contact. Yes, even the bomb is greedy to score kills.<br/><br/>The flummoxed troopers tell the bomb too bad, it's going to blow up whether it wants to or not, but that's greeted with a "Negative Trooper!" It holds the rank of Captain. There's even a little insignia painted on its hull. It's the senior officer here and it will be giving the orders, thank you very much.<br/><br/><b><i>Bad to Worse</i></b><br/>I laugh and laugh as John and Ryan try to argue with the bomb, sullenly resigning themselves to taking its orders. It's the most fun I had all weekend. Then in the midst of this debate the sentries spot something in the forest -- it's more alien striders lurking nearby. Disturbingly enough they've been standing there the whole time, keeping an eye (a big eye mind you) on the bomb.<br/><br/>Once they're spotted the aliens stride out of the forest and attack, and to avoid being a total jerk GM I don't spend another threat to ambush again. The troopers are very hard-pressed anyway, and just as the fighting is at it's worst the bomb declares that if the troopers can't hold out it should probably just detonate right now to avoid capture by the enemy. Gee, thanks.<br/><br/>Caught between a rock and a hard place, Sgt. Cabral cuts loose with a Strength to save the surrounded squad (details hazy, but it involved positioning his men with crack precision to lay down fields of fire and cut down the approaching striders).<br/><br/>With heavy casualties and possibly only minutes before more aliens show up, Trooper Seven risks disobeying a superior officer and tries to sneakily connect the override device they salvaged from the tech team, but the bomb spots him (failed NFA) and orders Sgt. Cabral to arrest the unlucky grunt for court-martial. Cabral, having already shot one trooper today for disobedience, pulls his side-arm but then fakes out the bomb and lets Seven dodge past him and slam the override home (finally, a successful NFA turns up) before it can detonate out of spite.<br/><br/>As the now lobotomized smart bomb does its best HAL-9000 imitation our heroes set the manual timer and then beat feet for the pick-up zone, fleeing the blast area Predator-style.<br/><br/>Mission accomplished.<br/><br/><i>post-mission:</i><br/>\tSergeant Cabral - 26 kills, raises NFA (6/6). Cabral bucks for promotion and is denied. How many troopers do you have to shoot around here to become an officer?<br/>\tTrooper Seven - 5 kills, raises NFA (7/4).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164718/#Comment_164718" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-24T07:48:38+00:00" title="August 24, 2008  7:48AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 24, 2008 8:05AM by Ben_Robbins.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As has already doubtless become apparent, instead of artists I named all my planets after flowers. Just how I roll. Nothing like a legion of hardened killers fighting over someplace called Periwinkle.<br/><br/><b>Planet 3: JUNIPER</b><br/><i>"Hey Sarge, how'd you get a campaign badge for Juniper? I thought they just nuked it from orbit."</i><br/><i>"You're damned right they did, Trooper. You're damned right..."</i><br/><br/><b><i>Shipboard</i></b><br/>An ordinary day aboard the troop-attack ship Sevastopol. Sgt. Cabral and Trooper Seven are alone in a maintenance bay, making sure their suits are drop-ready. There has been a certain edginess on ship for the last few days. Nothing you could put your finger on, just a nervousness in the mess hall, the same kind of tension before the order goes through for a big drop. Like something was about to drop in the pot.<br/><br/>Suddenly alarm klaxons sound, flashing lights flash, sickening shudders run through the ship, followed by the shudders of slamming pressure hatches. Then the lights go out and the gravity turns off. Then nothing.<br/><br/>Floating in the dark, Cabral and Seven pick up only static where the shipboard comm should be. Somewhere in the very belly of the ship there is dead silence. The usual subliminal hum of the Sevastopol's drive furnace has gone missing. The troopers can tell that for the moment she's a tin can drifting through space.<br/><br/><b><i>Disaster in Space</i></b><br/>Is the Sevastopol under attack? They won't find out in this maintenance bay. Cut off and clueless, Cabral and Seven fall back on standing order number 1: find and destroy the enemy. They overriding the manual safety on the pressure door so they can go find out what the hell is going on.<br/><br/>"Okay, we activate the magnetic boots in our power armor so we don't have to float around..." says John, hoping for a break. Negative says the cruel GM. These suits are built for planetary conflict, and besides it's much more fun to watch the troopers drift down the silent corridors (there's no mechanical impediment or anything, it just looks pretty).<br/><br/>The troopers are alarmed to find vacuum in the corridor beyond -- whatever hit the Sevastopol really did a number on her. Instead of rescue teams and ready troops rushing up and down the corridor they find... nothing. Where is everybody? Sucked into space?<br/><br/>They make their way to the bridge to link up with survivors and find out what's going on but are brought up short when the curving passageway opens into empty space, giving them a nice view of the massive damage shearing away one surface of the ship. In the darkness they can barely make out another vessel nearby, a silhouette blocking out the starfield. Friend? Foe?<br/><br/>Recognizing that the bridge is, well, gone, Cabral and Seven turn back and head for the escape pods in the stern. If there are any survivors, that's where they'll be.<br/><br/><b><i>"They look just like us!"</i></b><br/>As they move through the massive ship the only people they find are dead people -- troopers caught at mess when the deck decompressed, now corpses floating next to their last meal. Cabral and Seven ponder how lucky they were to have been in a sealed compartment and wearing power armor.<br/><br/>The first survivor they do find opens fire on them with his sidearm, but their armor stops the small slugs easily and they wrestle the panicked figure into submission (successful FA check). He's not standard military -- his light vacc suit bears the insignia of Technical Intelligence, the science spooks most troopers never even see because they're hidden away somewhere dreaming up twisted new wonder weapons or calculating how many marines can be reasonably sacrificed to provide a distraction. Regular marines naturally view them with suspicion and revulsion, if they ever see them at all.<br/><br/>The spook is terrified. Even after getting a good look at the troopers he seems sure they are out to get him. Only after seeing their campaign badges and quizzing them about their tours on Daisy and Narcissus does he visibly relax and take them into his confidence.<br/><br/>"Listen, they look just like us. Understand? Just like us. I'm the only one left that knows what's going on. It's critical to the fleet that I get off this ship in one piece. You two cover my ass -- you see anyone, ANYONE, you drop them before they get a chance to drop us. You hear me? Anyone!"<br/><br/>The Sevastopol is a big ship, but Cabral and Seven have never heard of it having TechInt staff, and they have certainly never seen this guy before. "Of course not, I'm not from this ship. Now zip it and move out Sergeant." His TechInt rank gives him the effective rank of Major, so he's in charge whether they like it or not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_164719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164719/#Comment_164719" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-24T07:49:16+00:00" title="August 24, 2008  7:49AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 24, 2008 7:52AM by Ben_Robbins.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>(Juniper continued)</i><br/><br/><b><i>Friendly Fire</i></b><br/>The not entirely reassured marines move out and before long come across some other marines moving towards them in the corridor -- the PCs roll an ambush, but can't decide if they really want to attack. The Intelligence spook is ordering them to open fire, not take any chances, etc. but our heroes are hesitant to cut down what look like their own men. At the last minute the approaching marines spot the spook drifting near the ceiling and Cabral and Seven bite the bullet and open fire.<br/><br/>It's short and sweet, a handy victory for Cabral and Seven as they cut down their fellow space marines. As the dust settles (a metaphor in zero-G) they move forward to examine the bodies. The Intelligence spook is exultant as he examines the shattered faceplate of one of the dead marines. "See? Look right there. He's one of them. Good work Trooper, you too Sergeant. I'll see you both get commendations for this."<br/><br/>I make it quite clear to John and Ryan that they see _nothing_ to mark the dead marine as an alien. They start to get a sinking feeling in their stomachs that they have backed the wrong horse and hooked up with a deranged lunatic who has convinced them to slaughter their own brothers-in-arms. There's a certain grim silence around the gaming table. After their past victories and tough scrapes they have really grown to like their characters, so this reversal is really getting them in the gut. I let them stew for just a minute or two more before letting them off the hook:<br/><br/>One of the drifting corpses begins to twitch and then twist in inhuman ways, the spine ratcheting left and right as the limbs flail spasmodically. The spook is horrified: "Oh god, it's a Phase 2!" Then the armored body swells and bursts, long flat worms rippling out and swimming through the vacuum towards our heroes.<br/><br/>It's a short fight (relatively few threat), allowing the troopers to mow down the first wave of worms and then flee before the other corpses burst as well. The spook goes down in the first round, the worms wrapping themselves around his suit and burrowing in through the joints before a grenade puts him out of his misery. A suitably horrible death for the spook.<br/><br/><br/><b><i>Abandon Ship: women, children and alien doppeltroopers first</i></b><br/>The now somewhat relieved troopers leave the carnage behind them and beat feet for the escape pods, but when they get there they draw up short: the pod bay is filled with locked-and-loaded soldiers. But are they good-old red blooded space marines or alien infected doppeltroopers?<br/><br/>As Cabral and Seven skulk and watch more troopers arrive, and then without warning one of the troopers levels his weapon and guns down another marine standing next to him. Chaos erupts as troopers turn on each other while others dive for cover or throw up their hands in confusion. No one seems to know what's going on except the doppeltroopers.<br/><br/>All the remaining threat goes on the table and Cabral and Seven spring into action, mowing down suspected doppeltroopers and anyone else who points a gun at them. It's sheer mayhem. Trooper Seven pops a Strength to end the carnage, hurling grenades into packs of doppeltroopers with no regard for his own safety (anyone remember what the actual Strength he used was?).<br/><br/>When it's all over the marines stand victorious but at great price. The Sevastopol is damaged beyond repair and has to be abandoned and scuttled. The few survivors are transfered to other vessels (after very thorough medical screenings).<br/><br/>In post-game our heroes learn that the Sevastopol had recovered a probe that had been sent ahead to Juniper to see if it harbored alien life, and a TechInt team had secretly come aboard to examine the recovered sample (their arrival was what caused the rumors among the crew at the beginning). A minor lab accident resulted in staff getting infected by the alien micro-organism and spreading the infection to the crew. Fully-infected doppeltroopers eventually tried to take the bridge and opened fire on a nearby ship, resulting in a ship-to-ship collision that caused severe damage to the Sevastopol.<br/><br/>Juniper is nuked from orbit, and few outside of the highest echelons ever know what really happened aboard the Sevastopol...<br/><br/><i>post-mission:</i><br/>\tSergeant Cabral - 44 kills, raises FA (7/6)<br/>\tTrooper Seven - 28 kills, raises NFA (7/5). For his outstanding service Trooper Seven is promoted to Corporal.<br/><br/>Ryan getting promoted back to Corporal added a nice justice to the evening after his untimely demise on Narcissus. I'm not sure but I think Cabral might have also used a strength during this mission and was denied promotion again. Tough luck Sarge.<br/><br/>Yes, lots and lots of kills. Were all of them aliens, or were some just innocent soldiers mistaken for doppeltroopers? We will never know. Shoot first, etc.<br/><br/>When I ran Juniper I was prepping in a hurry (never thinking we'd get to three planets in one night) so I didn't use a special power, but if I did it again I'd give them Impair (because the troopers are hesitant to attack their own guys) or Induce Weakness (since killing your buddies could certainly cause some freak out moments).<br/><br/>End of game 1, the Sevastopol missions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164788">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164788/#Comment_164788" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-24T13:04:49+00:00" title="August 24, 2008  1:04PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 24, 2008 1:06PM by John_Harper.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hot damn, that was a fun introduction to 3:16.<br/><br/>A few little extra bits I recall:<br/>- The moment of discovery on Daisy, when the eye-stalk aliens gazed down on us... so good. "They're everywhere!" Also, the eating with their eyes was just unsettling.<br/><br/>- Against the smart bomb, Sgt. Cabral actually shot Trooper Seven for apparent mutiny. The bomb was surprised but satisfied by this turn of events, and while its attention was misdirected, the unhurt Seven attached the control unit.<br/>Afterwards:<br/>"You actually shot me, Sarge! That wasn't part of the plan!"<br/>"I hit the center chestplate. Toughest part of the suit. Quit yer bellyachin'."<br/><br/>- Ben's smart bomb voice was so good. It was like a Dalek crossed with Grand Moff Tarkin. "Evacuate? In our moment of triumph?" I'm glad we failed our early rolls, because it was so fun getting pushed around by that officious ass.<br/><br/>- On the Sevastapol, we weren't sure if the other troopers were really bad guys or not, so I shoved the TechInt officer into their field of fire to test them. Sadly, I failed my roll, so both Cabral and the officer tumbled out of hiding and the fight was on. I think I may have used the guy as a human shield, too. Sgt. Cabral is not above such things.<br/><br/>-------<br/><br/>Ben established a high bar for 3:16 GMing, and introduced several key techniques that I incorporated into my own games. The main ones being:<br/><br/><b>The troopers don't know shit.</b> No one tells them anything, command is a mystery, and their training is pretty minimal. They just get thrown into the fire and have to hope for the best.<br/><br/><b>The universe is big and mysterious.</b> Yeah, troopers kill aliens by the dozens. But the universe is not just going to roll over and die. There's much more going on than planet after planet of mindless monsters to fight.<br/><br/><b>The squad makes the tough choices.</b> The Lt. barks at them over the comm, but the GM doesn't take the true decision points away from the players. Ben did a really good job of putting pressure on us from command, but always putting the ball in our court when it came time to decide what we were really going to do. This is a tricky thing, and I'm glad I got to see Ben do it before I tried it myself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_164801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/oliof" title="oliof"><img alt="oliof" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.mausdompteur.de/gravn32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/oliof">oliof</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164801/#Comment_164801" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-24T14:09:20+00:00" title="August 24, 2008  2:09PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John: What do you think of reviving Fudge Force 9 on top of the 3:16 rules?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164814/#Comment_164814" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-24T15:11:30+00:00" title="August 24, 2008  3:11PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, that takes me back, Harald.

A minor lab accident resulted in staff getting infected by the alien micro-organism and spreading the infection to the crew. Fully-infected doppeltroopers eventually tried to take the bridge and opened fire on a nearby ship, resulting in a ship-to-ship collision that caused severe damage to the Sevastopol.<br/></blockquote>\nHmm... maybe that's what they told you, but I was on the Sevastapol, and I can tell you from personal experience that ain't how it went down.
