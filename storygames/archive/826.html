<p>Regular gaming with folks during the week is optimal in a lot of ways, since there isn't a lot of scheduled stuff happening and I like to keep my weekends more freeform. But it can be really tough to fit in a game right after work, especially one creating a lot of creativity and investment. Any tips about how best to fit it in?</p>

                            I'm in two weekly groups that meet on Monday and Wednesday nights respectively.  One group has been a long-standing tradition that my wife and I work around (it's her free fun night as well) and the other falls on the day she works late.  So schedule-wise, it works for us.<br/><br/>Both groups share the work load.  One group focuses on short-run, light prep indie games and we rotate coordination/GM duty between the three of us.  The other has been meeting since 1999 and also rotates GMing, over the course of long campaigns (currently TSOY).  Everyone contributes to the setting and most take turns running things as people get burned out.<br/><br/>That said, it is a huge time and energy commitment and I couldn't do it unless I really, really loved it.                        </div>

                            What I and many of my friends "Work" at is a very tiring thing. We are drafted soldiers(across a wide variety of jobs), and often unappreciated.<br/><br/>Although we may reach the table in foul mood and tired, almost anything to do is good at this point, if it can take your mind off of going back to work tomorrow...<br/><br/>Also, that may be why we play competitive games(Munchkin, Illuminati, Settlers of Cattan and my CSI Games category of RPGs), it allows us to be aggressive..                        </div>

                            For me, the key is taking a break between work and play.  We order pizza, socialize, and generally get ourselves 'in the mode' of play instead of all having our heads at work instead.  Although <i>Gloria Mundi</i> technically starts at 6pm on Mondays, we actually have people show up as early as 5:30, and we usually don't start until shortly after 7pm.<br/><br/>The other key to playing on weeknights is to keep session short and focused.  We rarely end after 11pm (since, among other things, people have to go home!) and our best sessions tend to last around three hours instead of playing through to the bitter end.<br/><br/>Finally, I've found it helps a lot to have decentralized play, so that people are almost never not-playing once you begin play.  During a typical session of <i>Gloria Mundi</i>, you'll have one GM with a player in the kitchen, two players discussing things in the bedroom, and the other three players swapping around the attention of the other two GMs, so people almost never get <i>out</i> of the mode of play, and rarely have to ask themselves "Why am I here instead of at home, chilling out?"<br/><br/>That's what works for us, but I'm really interested to hear what other people have to say.  I'm sure there are lessons we can apply!<br/><br/>--Jess<br/><br/>PS-edit: Oh yeah, playing after work has also forced me and my co-GMs to hone our improvisational skills, as we often don't have time to prep session.  We've figured out ways to make meaningful, deeply invested story with almost no planning ahead (by front-loading work, offloading meaning-making onto players, etc.) and we use them.  A lot.                        </div>

                            The one thing that's frustrating about gaming on a work night is that some games require a lot of prep on the part of the GM.  D&amp;D, for example, traditionaly requires figuring out monster stats, NPC's, and so on.  Even Sorcerer takes some deep thought to get good Bangs and hard Humanity dilemmas.  In my old job, I had enough down time during the day to handle this, but that's not the case now.<br/>
<br/>
I'd think that games with lighter prep would be best: Primetime Adventures, Trollbabe, perhaps Capes.  Things where you sketch something in, and the other people react to it.                        </div>

                            I used to play a weekly D&amp;D game during lunch at work. I wrangled up some co-workers who were curious to learn or had played in junior high. You have to stop work to eat lunch (right?), so you might as well socialize and roll dice, too.                        </div>

                            We played D&amp;D on Friday nights, like once a month. One of our players had to drive up to Owings Mills (north of Baltimore) from Bowie, MD, which is a good 45 minutes without traffic. Another player came up from Northern Virginia. Sometimes his drive took 3 hours due to rush hour. It sucked.<br/><br/>By the time people got settled in and got some dinner, we chatted for a bit, then jumped into gaming. Maybe played from 7:30 to 11:30 PM. We occasionally had people fall asleep during games (despite, usually, being interested in the game).<br/><br/>So how'd we manage? Not so well.                        </div>

                            We play Wednesday nights, and I <em>love</em> it.  It also helps that where we play is at the midpoint of my two-hour commute, so instead of driving two hours home, I drive forty-five minutes, game for a few hours, and then blaze home at midnight along deserted freeways.<br/><br/>I don't have much of a problem being tired -- usually -- or brain-fried.  I think this is more because my job is very technically-oriented, whereas gaming uses completely different parts of my brain.                        </div>

                            I only have experience that reinforces the points already made here:
<ul>
<li>Shorter sessions with active participation<br/></li><li>Commute convenience makes a huge difference, as do other conveniences
<ul>
<li>dinner preparation handled<br/></li><li>interruptions at a minimum<br/></li><li>dice (or other methods of determining events) available<br/></li><li>pens, pencils, paper, outlets, whatnot, set up<br/></li></ul>
</li><li>Regular scheduling (if you know it's EVERY Wednesday, you plan around it, rather than our group's "Sometimes Saturdays", and that INCLUDES prep time issues)<br/></li><li>Online reinforcement (always makes a difference if I can get characters done ahead of time, or even discuss "downtime" events)<br/></li></ul>
When the little details are taken care of, it's a lot easier to slip into character and spend the limited time wisely.                        </div>

                            The past few months, I've been struggling a bit with my weeknight game.<br/>
<br/>
When we started playing weeknights, we had 4 very regular players, who almost never showed up later than 6:30. And most of the time we finished by 10:30 (with one run until like 11:30, and a few til 11:00).<br/>
<br/>
Now, we have 2 players who show up reliably at 6:00, another two who generally show up by 6:30 (one new player, one of the old players, who seems to be not consistent now),  and one player who finds it hard to show up even by 7:00. So we are now almost never finishing before 11:00. We've also got one player who has only played a few sessions last year, and one this year, not sure what his schedule will actually be like.<br/>
<br/>
All along, one of the players (the one who has become less consisent) has been a snoozer. Fortunately he usually snoozes lightly, but still he misses things occaisionally. Oh, there's also the young wife who often snoozes also, but she is generally so peripherally engaged I almost don't count her (and one of these days, perhaps I'll get up the guts to address that situation - though it doesn't seem to create any negativity).<br/>
<br/>
I have come to the conclusion that weekend gaming just is out of the question for regular play, so I'm stuck with weeknight play. I'm also pretty convinced that for long term play, I want something with tactical miniatures style combat (D&amp;D, RuneQuest, Cold Iron, etc.). So a 4 hour session is really the minimum that works well for me.<br/>
<br/>
I may have to put my foot down and say that players have to be able to commit to showing up by 6:30. We do start before the 7:00 guy shows up, but it's tricky, and sometimes, the group is small enough that he's critical, so the other option is to cancel if we won't have at least 3 other players present.<br/>
<br/>
I also need to work on being ready to really launch into things once play is ready to start (after a suitable chit chat warm up time).<br/>
<br/>
One thought might also be to shift the time to 7:00 to 11:30. That would give me a little prep window. The other thought would be to probe as to why folks don't feel comfortable bringing their dinner with them and showing up a bit earlier (the young couple are the only ones who consistently bring their dinner or arrive at 6:00 already fed, occaisionally someone else will also bring dinner).<br/>
<br/>
I am sometimes low on energy after work, but once the game starts, I usually pick right up.<br/>

<p>I shall opine that D&amp;D, any edition, is the <em>wrong</em> game to play if you can only play in three hour sessions. Crap, combats in that game can go for a couple hours. While you're at it, why not schedule Advanced Civilization for weeknights?</p>
<p>This is, incidentally, possibly <em>the</em> most appealing factor to me about these tight scene-framing narrative games. You can actually crank out a coherent, satisfying chunk of story in three or four hours.</p>
<p>I <em>would</em> recommend <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adderall" rel="nofollow">Adderall</a>, but that would probably adversely impact the color of the creative process.</p>

                            Larry - in an ideal world, I'd be satisfied with one of these funky new-age games, or be able to retire and game all day...<br/>
<br/>
But the fact is, I like D&amp;D style combat, and 4 hour sessions are the best I can do...<br/>
<br/>
I was able to average 4 encounters in 4 hours in D20 games though. At lower levels. At higher levels, it became more difficult.<br/>

<p>Yeah, it sounds like one of the best ideas (and the one my group does) is having straight up socializing / foods for an hour or so, then have a more focused few hours of play. It's been said before, but food is a great group "ritual" to help people make that transition between "I was at work" to "I'm now at play".</p>
<p>Here's another thought: if you're dealing with R/L constraints (fatigue, work, time, or whatever), do you find that a game requiring heavy creative input will get you jazzed and running? Or do you prefer a game that let's you contribute in a more laid back way if need be, letting others drive the game and get more spotlight time? (Of course, this is a subjective question; what works for you?)</p>

                            We game on Wednesdays (usually DitV) and I game on Tuesdays (usually PTA, with other stuff tossed in) The transition time is important. The PTA game is just starting up again tonight, so I'll let you know how it goes.<br/>
<br/>
With the Dogs game, we start once the kids are in bed - 8:30/9 - and have a firm cut-off time of 11. Works good if we stick to the cut off time - if we don't, I get super cross because I have to be 'on' for three kidsall day, and if I'm underslept, it's not fair to them.<br/>
<br/>
Something I really like is the shorter sessions available in many indi games. I've written about the change in gaming from high school and college, when it was realistic to game all weekend, to adulthood/parenthood, when a game with realistic 3 hour sessions is great.                        </div>

                            I used to play in an online DnD, 3 hour long sessions. Combats usually took more than a session, or the whole of it, was a bummer, but that's life. Also, if the other players had been good on their rules like I were it'd probably would've gone much faster. So I helped them in PMs and so.<br/><br/>But such is life. Online may take less prep time, but communication and mechanical resolution takes more.                        </div>

                            Ha, funny, I utterly failed my group last night - we met at 7 PM as usual.  It had been a stressful work day for me, which came directly on the heels of a volunteer medical research "sleep study" that involved a nasal Ph probe and a full-on EEG, and thus no sleep.  And no food for 24 hours.  So was I worse than useless?  Yes, I was worse than useless and should have begged off, but didn't out of some sense of loyalty and obligation.                        </div>

                            I play via online chat on weeknights sometimes. It's easy to jump in and create a quick scene. There are usually several people online with whose characters mine are somehow involved, so that we can come up with a reason to interact. That means no commute, little build-up, plus I can eat and do other things while playing.                        </div>

                            Lots of good advice here, especially creating some space between work and play if you can, and making that social space. <br/>
<br/>
But I have an entirely different notion. Maybe you shouldn't play. If you don't leave work, and, getting into the car, your brain isn't going mad wondering what's going to happen in tonights game, then the problem isn't that the game requires lots of investment, but that you aren't invested in playing said game. <br/>
<br/>
That is, optimally at least, anticipation of RPG play should be giving you energy - at least occasionally - all on it's own. Heck, it makes me downright jittery at times. If I didn't feel that way, I don't think that I'd play evenings either. I might not play at all. <br/>

                            It's fairly recently that not playing after work was even an option for me, on account of having switched over to freelance work. OTOH my last job was doing security work on the weekends, so when I was GMing I could usually plan out the session at work. But still, I was usually at least a little bit out of it, and there were times when I forced myself to run the game for my friends' benefit even though I didn't feel like it. Fortunately the game didn't suffer for it.<br/>
<br/>
But yeah, having a regularly scheduled time for it is the only way we ever got an ongoing campaign to work.                        </div>

                            Like a fair number of Brit gamers we meet after work ina bar. A lot of pubs have a function room and they are happy to let clibs use them on quiet nights provided you spend enough on food (or beer). We tend to order food and drinks on arrival, chill, and slide into gaming around 7pm. We usually play for about three hours. Playing HeroQuest, with the ability to mix simple and extended contests, help us make progress within those time constraints. Games with complex tactical resolution would probably be trickier, but there are other groups there including D&amp;D and Exalted who seem to manage.                        </div>

                            I have used Denny's and local coffee shops for years. Frankly having people bring me drinks and snacks is the only way i can make it gaming on weeknights. Now I play on sunday afternoons, which is pretty cool too.                        </div>

                            Dev, lots of American establishments have a function room too.<br/>
<br/>
Check out your local American Legion hall.  Most of them have bars, AND function rooms.  If one of your number is a serviceman or veteran, you're usually golden.                        </div>

                            I once attended an RPGA event held in the basement/event room of a local bar. It worked out very nicely since they already had a Wunderbar soda dispenser in place for free soft drinks, and if anyone was hungry he could just order food from the bar upstairs and have it brought down.                        </div>

Locally, we have Mister Toad's (indie coffee house), Caribou Coffee, and of course Starbucks. But Starbucks sucks.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            There's a place in Danbury, CT called (as I recall) the "Brass Rail" that had a room upstairs where our SCA canton (Ravenhill) had its monthly business meetings.  The chatelaine always ordered the French dip.<br/>
<br/>
Any place that serves food and drink will likely gladly host meetings of pretty much any sort, if they've got the space, because butts in seats mean sales.  You just can't schedule for their most busy times (usually friday and saturday nights) because meetings don't generate as much business as a slew of people looking for food.                        </div>
