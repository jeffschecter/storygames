I've been thinking long and hard over the last two years about myself and table-top RPGs, and why I play them.  Recently, this has directed me to discover this site and The Forge, and have learned a lot; but, that's a story for another day.  One thing I haven't figured out yet, is why I seem so attracted to the idea of solving problems in RPGs.  Two particular RPGs I have been extremely interested in the past 4 years (but have not yet had the chance to play) are Mage: The Awakening and Vampire: The Requiem.  Now, please don't reply if you are groaning already.  Let me explain why I have taken such an interest to these (arguably broken) products.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Mage, you are given the chance to create a magically endowed character with the inside status to go on quests to learn the mystical secrets of the earth and the universe(s) beyond.  Cool setting, but whatever; it's been done (arguably better).  What really stokes me when I read about this game is the magic system.  Now, here is the weird thing.  I can't pick up anything about Mage's system that caters to strong roleplaying tools.  Zilch.  Yet, there is something so extremely cool looking about the way the mechanics work, and the way the player (and, sure, the character, too) manipulates the environment to cast spells.  As some would say, it's very, very crunchy.  But... it's not rules heavy in the sense that it attempt to simulate.  It's rules heavy in the sense that it gives the player lots of options and breaks them down in cool ways.  So if the GM throws a conflict at me, I have the fun of trying to figure out how to use my character's magical abilities to conquer the situation.  Anyone have any insight into this?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Vampire, you are given the chance to play wolf among sheep, a god among mortals.  The idea that human society becomes my playground to romp around in is very attractive to me.  Add in all the dark elements: addictive blood ties, vampire cults, undead beings, twisted and manipualtive familial relationships, etc, etc. and it's even got a nice backdrop to go along with it.  But really, that is what excites me; not the potential to explore a story about the inner horror of playing this kind of character.  Nonononono.  I am attracted to the idea that I have dozens, maybe hundreds of years to reach whatever goal I choose for my character, and I even have the advantage that the stupid humans don't even know who I am, or what I'm capable of.  Other Vampires?  Well, now you have PvP, right?  Because you have these creatures are both godlike, but have potentially COMPLETELY different powers; how will they be used against each other to gain the upper hand?  That's exciting to me, too.  This idea of using the power (effectiveness) the game grants my character to creatively solve obstacles placed in my way.... I just love it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo..... what does any of this have to do with roleplaying, at all?  It almost reminds me to ask the question why I like solving puzzles and riddles when I play D&amp;D.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- John M.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/boulet" title="boulet"><img alt="boulet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/534/nTWF4B3HT5CT6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/boulet">boulet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153995/#Comment_153995" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-30T19:43:41+00:00" title="June 30, 2008  7:43PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm personally convinced the magic concept of Mage the Awakening could be hacked in a low crunch system and be a blast. It's probably been done... There must be someone somewhere who melted it into DRYH for instance, transposing the Paradox into a fluid game system.<br/><br/>Fortunately there are several aspects of fun embedded inside most rpgs. Puzzle solving is a classic, like Grimtooth's traps dedication to harming generations of puzzled PCs proves. I can't help you specifically about why "matching shapes and holes" is rocking your boat. I'm weary of analyzing the reasons behind my fun personally. I'm afraid if I open this Pandora's box, the fun might fly away and never come back. It's a bit like these teachers who wasted many books for me by analyzing, or should I say dissecting, the structures, literary forms, intentions, biographies... At some point the spontaneous enjoyment of the words had lost its flesh under the repetitive assaults of critic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_154000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154000/#Comment_154000" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-30T19:52:50+00:00" title="June 30, 2008  7:52PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Dev's got a low crunch Mage hack.

While I don't think this is the sole mandate or benefit, it's certainly a big one. Part of putting yourself in someone else's shoes is to tackle the problems they face. There's a lot of enjoyment to be had in roleplaying someone's good days, or their heroic triumphs, but I might suggest that a majority of <i>growth</i> that comes from roleplaying games is roleplaying through a problem that you've never personally faced (or never faced in this way).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_154005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Big_J_Money" title="Big_J_Money"><img alt="Big_J_Money" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Big_J_Money">Big_J_Money</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154005/#Comment_154005" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-30T20:06:23+00:00" title="June 30, 2008  8:06PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I won't turn this into a "Why White Wolf products are/aren't broken." debate, mostly because I'm not qualified, but here are my reasons for including that aside, to clear the air early:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) By arguably broken, I mean, the system when scrutinized could be seen to have contradicting or unrelated rewards systems.  This is not one iota unique to White Wolf games; I hope there are no alarm bells when people see the words "Requiem" and "broken" in the same sentence -- that would certainly be creating something that isn't there.  Broken != Unplayable.  Broken == Benefits from repairs.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) I've read and heard enough accounts of people explaining what they consider "broken", that to not include that little aside would be to ignore a lot of discussion that has already taken place.  I simply want people to realize I'm willing to see both sides.  I absolutely do not care to make an argument either way.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, emphasis was on the "arguably", and not on the "broken".  I hope everyone understands.  Now, please, I hope nobody quotes that aside the focus in their reply, as it isn't directly relevant to the content of my OP, which is about playing role playing games for the unlimited potential to solve problems creatively using the tools on your character sheet.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- John.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154081/#Comment_154081" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-01T07:34:24+00:00" title="July  1, 2008  7:34AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            *shameless self promotion* Solipsist has been described as "Mage done better" and not by me <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> *end shameless self promotion*<br/><br/>I think you've hit on a nice point though, about the joy of using mechanics for their own sake, and how attractive a part of gaming that is. This is not the same as gamism (where you play with the rules to achieve an end, that being dominance) but a love of tinkering. I've seen the same with GURPS players who love to use the full combat system, not because they are able to min-max it into winning everything, but because they like to twiddle with all the little specific options.<br/><br/>In a way a system that tells the GM that they can give +2 for anything cool is less satisfying to be on the receiving end of than one which rewards you with a +2 for remembering to run an extra foot before your takedown attempt. Even though the first system gets you bonuses much more often.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_154257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154257/#Comment_154257" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-01T18:03:01+00:00" title="July  1, 2008  6:03PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, for that matter, Unknown Armies is a "Mage done better" game.

If my strengths lie in intelligence (not saying they do, just a hypothetical) then I don't make low intelligence characters (because handicapping myself in that way would be quite tricky) nor do I make high intelligence characters (because then I'm just pawning them). I make characters to whose struggles intelligence is not really a factor.
