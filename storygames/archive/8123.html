We had all read the rules at some point, but only Chris P. had read them recently. So we went over them at the table as we were starting play.<br/><br/><b>Setting:</b><br/>The game is really about islands in an archipelago, but we were all into some sci-fi. So we agreed that asteroids in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiper_belt" rel="nofollow">Kuiper Belt</a>, specifically the sparsely asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. This was taking place sometime in the 22nd century, but the feeling was less Cyberpunk and more gritty. Maybe closer to the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/find?s=all&amp;q=outland&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" rel="nofollow">Outland</a>. Man had been mining valuable minerals from these asteroids for several generations now and shipping them off to Mars, or even Earth.<br/><br/>As per the rules, we drew up a quick map of the region with several asteroids (mostly being mined by a government/corporation group), a small mass of micro asteroids, a few radio relays, a tiny trading post build from the remnants of a spaceship and an asteroid, a small group of religious pilgrims (Unitarians) who carved out their own destiny called Rapture, and a few other things such as the abandoned and contaminated Skylab 8 and a giant dust cloud.  Oh and an alien artifact that had just come out of the cloud.<br/><br/><b>Characters:</b><br/><br/>Robert created <i>Jorge "Duck" Dobbins</i>, a old first gen belter. He had adapted so much to the low-gee that he can't go back to Earth.  Robert also created a connection to <i>Imram Khalil</i>, an Elder of the religious pilgrims at Rapture. The two had little in common as far as Faith went, but they had relied on each other many times over the years and had become as close as they could be.<br/><br/>Chris P. made <i>Matthew</i>, a young third-gen Unitarian who was a grandson to Imram Khalil. He also created a connection to (someone whose name is too long to remember so I'll just say) <i>Laireli</i>, someone who was unknown to him except that he had an upcoming arranged marriage to her. And he didn't know that she was an alien.<br/><br/>I made <i>Xiao-Ching Atkinson</i>, a young man who recently showed up and works for <i>Artemas Gomez</i>, the grumpy old guy who runs the tiny but independent trading post and carries the interesting and rare supplies that the government ships never bring into the belt. Xiao-Ching is secretly in love with a girl named <i>Abigail Zebulon</i> who lives on Rapture.  "Dogs in the Kuiper Belt", anyone??<br/><br/><b>Destiny Points</b><br/><br/>Each player is supposed to write one destiny point for each of the other players, but that would give each of us only two to choose from, so we doubled this to have more choices.  Here are the destiny points that were written for us with the one each player chose in bold.<br/><br/>Robert:<br/>-<b>Duck discovers that Imram Khalil is secretly plotting against Franklin's Landing (the huge government base in the belt that is run by only a few people including Duck).</b><br/>-Duck finds that the Rapture Unitarians are preparing Skylab 8 as a human-alien breeding ground.<br/>-Duck moves into Rapture's old folks home.<br/>-Duck disappears into the Crylla (dust) Cloud.<br/><br/>Chris P.:<br/>-<b>Laireli bonds with Matthew, fusing with him and destroying his solitary identity.</b><br/>-Matthew finds that the government is trying to take the alien artifact.<br/>-Finds that his alien bride really does exist.<br/>-Discovers a love that tempts him to leave Rapture and the Unitarians forever.<br/><br/>Chris B.:<br/>-<b>Discovers the horrible alien truth about Abigail.</b><br/>-Xiao-Ching dies in Skylab 8.<br/>-He marries Abigail and returns to Earth.<br/>-He has an opportunity to steal a starship and keep it.<br/><br/>I listed out all of the possible destiny points here not only to show you the cool possibilities each of us had (that were authored by the others), but also to note that we all used elements of at least one of the other destiny points to add some more interest to their story.<br/><br/><b>Ownership:</b><br/><br/>Each player is supposed to take ownership over certain elements of the fiction and gains veto power over that part. This was actually one of my favorite parts of the game since there is no GM and I felt like this provided some weight to keep the fiction from going off the deep edge and gave each player strict creative control over something other than just their character.<br/><br/>After some discussing, Robert chose <i>Social</i>, Chris P. chose <i>Alien Technology</i> and I chose <i>Human Technology</i>.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178842/#Comment_178842" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-15T19:13:05+00:00" title="November 15, 2008  7:13PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Story</b><br/><br/>Since this isn't a playtest, I'll just hit the highlights of the story.<br/><br/>-The Unitarians flew a regular supply ship to the trading post to get the things that they needed. And Abigail made sure she was on those runs so she could get to see her secret love, Xiao-Ching. Matthew came along as well to make sure they got the right supplies. Xiao-Ching expressed his love for her and said that he would think of a way to get her out of Rapture so they could be together.<br/><br/>-Duck was monitoring some signal traffic when he noted that someone from Rapture was sending signals to something in space. It turned out to be some sort of alien device or craft that was heading away from the dust cloud and towards Franklin's Landing and Rapture. Duck ended up flying to Rapture to confront his old friend Imram about this and was told that "something wonderful was going to happen" and was convinced to keep things a secret just until the next regular supply ship from Mars arrived in three months.<br/><br/>-Matthew was kept from hearing about the conversation between Imram and Duck, and he was nervously awaiting to find out who his bride-to-be was. Turns out it was this totally hot alien woman (who looked like Liv Tyler). He was scared, but also kinda turned on.<br/><br/>-Long story short, Abigail got "sick" after arriving back in Rapture and was put in confinement to avoid an outbreak while the Eldars asked for medicine to get delivered from the trading post. Xiao-Ching had his spaceship-owning friend Jefferson Cho come by and pick him up in his hooptie shuttle he liked to call "The Cho". They flew from the trading post to Rapture just as Duck was leaving Rapture to go back to Franklin's Landing.<br/><br/>-While this was happening, Duck got an urgent call from the few other guys at Franklin's Landing saying that something strange was now heading straight for their base on the asteroid! Duck called up Imram to ask him what was going on. But as the five men tried to leave Franklin's in space suits and EVA sleds, they were trapped by the alien device which crashed into the base and started expanding it's crystal latticework all around the asteroid. Creating some sort of mechanical Genesis Device effect.  <br/><br/>-But it gets creepier. Xiao-Ching took the "medicine" to the "sick" Abigail, and ended up shooting her with a tranquilizer to make it look to the Elders like she was doing really had and needed to be taken to a hospital facility to save her life. It was a lame rescue attempt, but then Xiao-Ching was an excitable 20-year old spacer guy. He got her out and they took off in "The Cho", but when he went in the back to consummate things on the shag floor, she showed her true alien self and began to meld with him, blinding Jefferson in the cockpit with white beams of light.<br/><br/>-And then we switched over to Matthew, who was getting married to Laireli in a solemn ceremony on Rapture. And as the two went behind a dais to consummate <i>their</i> union, she melded into him and the audience stood as they were bathed in the same bright white light.<br/><br/>-The story ended with Jorge "Duck" Dobbins realizing that Imram had lied to him and that the aliens were going to take over the entire mining area in the asteroids. So he set a course for Mars orbit and used all of the fuel on his shuttle to make a long burn, hoping that he would make it far enough before he died to be able to send a signal of warning. <b>That the aliens were coming.</b><br/><br/><b>Thoughts</b><br/><br/>As is usual in these types of games, the first few scenes were a little unwieldy as we tried to feel out the system.  <br/><br/>Here are some other observations and problems we had about the rules:<br/><br/>1. Some players found the "Do it differently, please" or "Draw a card, please" to be weird or disruptive in play. But we all liked the "More detail, please" as long as it wasn't overused.<br/>2. Once we got into the meat of the story, we found that our destinies were moving together. And the nexus was likely going to be in or near Rapture. This was probably a conscious choice by us as players to keep the story arcs intertwined and not just have three different stories that didn't really connect. It might be interesting to add this to the rules, unless you didn't intend for their stories to be connected.<br/>3. The creation of Destiny Points was confusing to us. There is info about creating them that appears later in the rules, and that should probably be referenced on the earlier page that deals with Starting the Session so the players don't learn about it later. We all ended up creating Destiny Points that were quite a bit different in structure, which made us wonder who was doing them wrong. But in the end we all had four things to choose from so it was okay. But definitely more guidance and more/better examples would have helped here.<br/>4. We had a lot of confusing the first time someone said "Draw a card", as the rules there don't seem to match the example given. We made a call at the table that we would follow the rules and ignore the example, but some clarity would help there.<br/>5. I felt like the Ownership and possible also the Veto rules should have been placed earlier in the rules as they are very relevant to setting up the setting and characters.<br/>6. We didn't read over the Important Techniques very much at the table. But in scanning them I think they would be very useful for players who were either new to gaming or to story games in particular.<br/><br/>Overall I think Matthijs wrote a very elegant game that plays better than I had expected. I wondered how something so seemingly open-ended would play at the table. But the combination of Destiny Points and other techniques like Ownership/Vetos and "What else can you do?" tightened the game up considerable and made it a lot easier to not have an all-powerful GM at the table. I think the rules could take another editing pass to tighten them up, but the game is very playable (and enjoyable) as is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178844">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178844/#Comment_178844" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-15T19:15:42+00:00" title="November 15, 2008  7:15PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For those keeping track, we each had four scenes (the rules state 3-4 scenes to reach your Destiny Point) with the last scenes almost as montages. Very few conflicts that needed to be worked out. The short amount of scenes forced us all to move the story forward very quickly and not dawdle around with details that were not important.<br/><br/>Not including a few breaks, we probably spent 4 to 4.5 hours playing the game from start to finish. A good hour of that was world and character building.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson" title="Chris Peterson"><img alt="Chris Peterson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cpeterso.com/html/img/merman-confounded.200x200.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson">Chris Peterson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178859/#Comment_178859" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-15T20:54:56+00:00" title="November 15, 2008  8:54PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 15, 2008 8:59PM by Chris Peterson.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Caesar_X</cite>But we all liked the "More detail, please" as long as it wasn't overused.</blockquote>\nAnd don't forget "<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/TMI" rel="nofollow">TMI</a>! <i>Less</i> detail, please!" <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>My take on Archipelago:<br/><br/>* The game worked well once we were up and running. It was a little too free-form for my tastes: any conflicts were negotiated outside of the rules or by the 50/50 "draw a card" rule. But that's my personal preference in games.<br/><br/>* World creation was fun, but I think we invested too much time mapping details that never came up in play. (We only used about 50% of our asteroid map.) If "pre game" world creation is fun (and it was), it could benefit by closer integration into "real" game play.<br/><br/>* I originally thought 3-4 scenes was waaay too quick to reach our Destiny Points, but it was actually just right. With 4 scenes, we knew the end of our characters' story lines should be ending. We could plan what events or scenes needed to happen to reach our Destiny Points. That worked very well.<br/><br/>* Like in many of our games, some NPCs began to overshadow some of the PCs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson" title="Chris Peterson"><img alt="Chris Peterson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cpeterso.com/html/img/merman-confounded.200x200.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson">Chris Peterson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178860/#Comment_178860" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-15T20:56:04+00:00" title="November 15, 2008  8:56PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 15, 2008 8:57PM by Chris Peterson.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            btw, here are some actual photos of Jefferson Cho's space van <a href="http://www.geocities.com/phoenix0002/" rel="nofollow"><i>The Cho</i></a>!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178861">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178861/#Comment_178861" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-15T21:09:41+00:00" title="November 15, 2008  9:09PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That van looks like it escaped from a bad made-for-tv scifi movie circa 1979.<br/><br/>"If The Cho's a-rockin, don't come knockin!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178864/#Comment_178864" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-15T23:14:11+00:00" title="November 15, 2008 11:14PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That van hurts my heart.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178866/#Comment_178866" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-16T02:09:35+00:00" title="November 16, 2008  2:09AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chris &amp; co, I'm really glad you had fun with the game!

The description ended up workig out better, but it threw me for a loop at first, as I had to quickly re-wind and stumbled a bit.<br/><br/>"Draw a card, Please" was a little odd and we stumbled some. It wasn't clear whether we supposed to talk about what the <b>character</b> wanted or what the <b>player</b> wanted. I was pulling for it to be about what the <b>player</b> wanted, but Los Dos Chrises voted <b>character want</b> was the correct interpretation, so we went with that.<br/><br/>There was at least one example late in the game where there was a "Draw a card, Please" situation, and I think I managed to muddle through something close to a <b>As the Character I want(Good)</b> vs <b>As a Player I want ( Bad)</b> set up ( which, in keeping with our local traditions, Caesar_X immediately busted me on).<br/><br/>A couple of times, the active player also called for a card draw and asked the other player for help setting it up, just because we (the active player) wanted some sort of fork in the story and a bit of randomness in direction.<br/><br/>Overall, I really think Archipelago is a great look at what a co-operatively minded, GMless story game can look like. It's verfy much stripped down to core elements, and gives enough method/structure to get the players off and running. I thought that the Destiny Points worked out excellently, and nicely showcased how challenge has an important place even (perhaps especially) in a co-operative game, but in a way different from what it's often considered to have.<br/><br/>One minor point that might be worth discussing, and which I realized grated a little with Archipelago and also with Fiasco when we played it last week.<br/><br/>In GMless games where the players still have a main character, there is a design tendency to always pass off the ball to the next player, in order, throughout the game. I assume this is probably out of a sense of fairness and an attempt to not create an opening for spotlight hogging.<br/><br/>For me, I think that can make things a bit disruptive in terms of story-flow. I'm wondering if some ( probably optional) alternative structure of scene framing could be cobbled together, so that if one character's story is really jazzing up the group, they can follow it for more than one scene.

As you point out, the round-robin structure has been created to share the spotlight evenly, which is a Big Thing in a freeformish GM-less game. The first thing that springs to mind is letting each player have a certain amount of scenes that can be played out back-to-back if they want to; however, that might cause people to either hog all their scenes for the grand finale, or spend them all at the start and be less enthusiastic for the rest of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178904/#Comment_178904" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-16T10:41:48+00:00" title="November 16, 2008 10:41AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure there is a good answer to that issue with the scene rotation, but I do think that, since so much of this game functions on a co-operative and voluntary basis, there might be a way to gain this on the basis of simple trust and good social graces.<br/><br/>Perhaps "A Follow-Up scene, Please" ?<br/><br/>As for Draw a Card, how about "I'm stumped.

Because what I really, really need to emphasize more in the game text is how much it's based on player cooperation - and asking other players for help. This is a blind spot on my part; I thought I talked about it in the text, but apparently I haven't. So I've instructed my group to ask each other for help explicitly - "My character is in... um... Morten, where am I? The swamp, okay. Monica, could you play the weird little boy? Okay, I'm wading through the swamp..."<br/><br/>I still want a "random event" technique, though. Not sure how that would work, but I'm thinking something like players making a stack of random event cards for use in their campaign.

While the open brainstorming session is good ( and I like similar methods in other games), I find it to be helpful to have some bit of time or method where I can step back from simple discussion and write down a bit of my personal vison for the game, initially private from group discussion. I think the DPs work well for that, because rather than focssing that personal vision on my own character, I'm focussing it on the other characters, and it just seems like a natural way to merge my ideas with that of the overall story.<br/><br/>On the recieving end, I get some undiscussed feedback on what the other players are seeing in my character and the game. It is a form of challenge to work those ideas in with my vision of things ( in a good way: It challenges me as a player). Having four options to choose from in this game meant I could focus on the one that struck me as most interesting, but the other options also helped me modify my ideas and have something more to work with. <br/><br/>For example, Chris P's DP (Duck retires to the old folks' home on Rapture Base), started me thinking more about what Duck was like, and opened up the possibility for a stronger friendship with Imram Khalil, which turned out to be very important. There was a turning point where I, as a player, honestly didn't know which direction Duck was going to take because of that.<br/><br/>As for the map, I think having a physical artifact to work with really allowed for the openly discussed situation ideas to develop. Unlike a R-map (or something similar), which I sometimes find intimidating, I was able to both have ( again) some personal, undiscussed creative space to work with, and a way to tie some social relationships around the physical stuff. The literal closeness of Rapture Base to Franklin's Landing, as well as the appearance of the Alien Artifact and its projected physical path directly between the two ended up paralleling some of the clashes in relationships between the characters.<br/><br/><br/>So, yeah, good stuff!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178912/#Comment_178912" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-16T13:47:17+00:00" title="November 16, 2008  1:47PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm. Random event.<br/><br/>What if there was something like the DP cards, but it was a seperate deck developed during play, perhaps between turns? I really like that a player can choose which of the DPs provided to try to work into play, so maybe drawing two and picking one to work in? <br/><br/>That might work really well for me, when I start to become interested in the story of the secondary characters. For example, instead of exploring them deeply, when can have a bit of a cut scene that tells us just a bit more about them ( even if just in flashback). I suppose the same could be true about other backdrop stuff, too. Some of our background was a bit vague. For example, we never really explored the founding of Rapture, or how and why the Unitarians went there. I think we were all a bit enamored of Jefferson Cho and his character as well.<br/><br/>So, here, I'm thinking that at the end of each scene, a player simply writes out a simple one sentence topic and tosses it in this other deck. After a full go around of doing scenes, someone draws two of these cards, and picks one to do an "outside" scene revolving around that topic or secondary character.<br/><br/>I don't know that this secondary deck should accumulate throughout the game, but perhaps should be created after each set of individual scenes, and then rotates through players in the same sequence as the normal character scenes. In this way, it reminds me a bit of some styles of fiction ( especially SF) that I've seen.<br/><br/>So, the overall sequece might look like:<br/><br/>Caesar_X PC scene 1<br/>K-Bob PC scene 1<br/>Chris P PC scene 1<br/><br/>Break: All players create outside scene cards.<br/>Shuffle. Caesar_X draws two cards then starts a scene based on the one he finds interesting.<br/><br/><br/>Caesar_X PC scene 2<br/>K-Bob PC scene 2<br/>Chris P PC scene 2<br/><br/>Break: All players create outside new scene cards, or alternately re-usesa previous outside scene card.<br/>Shuffle. K-Bob draws two cards then starts a scene based on the one he finds interesting.<br/><br/><br/>Caesar_X PC scene 3<br/>K-Bob PC scene 3<br/>Chris P PC scene 3<br/><br/>Break: All players create outside scene cards (or a re-used one).<br/>Shuffle. Chris P draws two cards then starts a scene based on the one he finds interesting.<br/><br/>Caesar_X PC scene 4<br/>K-Bob PC scene 4<br/>Chris P PC scene 4<br/><br/>I don't think there needs to be one after the fourth round of scenes, although I suppose a debrief could use those ideas. That might help with keeping the main story focussed on the core characters and their interactions, while having a release valve for the other interesting but slightly tangental topics and characters, while also giving grist for dveleopments in those stories.<br/><br/>So, a sort of controlled set of evolving random events/topics directed by the interests of the participants, but not so metagamey?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson" title="Chris Peterson"><img alt="Chris Peterson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cpeterso.com/html/img/merman-confounded.200x200.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson">Chris Peterson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178915/#Comment_178915" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-16T15:19:59+00:00" title="November 16, 2008  3:19PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 16, 2008 3:22PM by Chris Peterson.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>What if there was something like the DP cards, but it was a seperate deck developed during play, perhaps between turns?

The combination of two DPs could produce a more deeper, more unexpected story line, especially for longer play.<br/><br/>Since we only had three players, we each wrote two DPs so each player would have four from which to choose.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178918/#Comment_178918" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-16T16:26:38+00:00" title="November 16, 2008  4:26PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Matthijs:<br/><br/>I'd like to have a discussion on design elements where co-operative play is the assumed baseline style.

Re: scene structure, after Robert finished up one of his scenes and I knew I had to wait until Chris P was done before I got a scene again, I wanted to throw in mini scene. Or at least establish a truth about something that my character saw. But there was no option for that in the rules. So I had to awkwardly ask for a quick mini scene that interrupted others and did not count against my 4 scene limit.<br/><br/>2. The 4 scene limit for each character before reaching their DP was actually pretty powerful as it caused us each to<br/>push pretty hard towards our destiny.

But there was no option for that in the rules.</blockquote>\nIf your characters were in each others' vicinity, you could easily jump in with your character in someone else's scene. That would make your character a secondary character for that scene - which means other people could narrate his/her actions, and go "Do it differently, please" on you. The idea behind this is, of course, to make sure that nobody can steal the narrative control from the current player; if you jump into someone else's scene, you're dancing to their tune.\n<blockquote>Matthijs, could you talk a little about your campaign structure?</blockquote>\nWe've only played twice so far, but the structure is really very simple. Each session starts with generation of Destiny Points for our characters - we don't create new characters or maps. Then we play. <br/><br/>We've started to gravitate towards each others' characters; specifically, we seem to play a lot of scenes involving General Katashi (a PC), who's stirring up a big war with the Monkey King (an NPC). It's a central conflict, and the character is a powerful man, heavy with destiny. The game seems to favor that sort of character (which wasn't intentional, but certainly is a bonus - it was meant, after all, to emulate the Earthsea books, where everything revolves around Ged and Tenar). <br/><br/>The characters and their relationships were originally designed for another system. That means we spent more time than implied in the Archipelago rules talking about our characters, and we set up an R-map before play. I will definitely include this in the next version of the rules; I think it gives the campaign a much more solid base to run from.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Also: how do we pronounce your name?</blockquote>\n<img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Something like "matt-eyes".

I wanted to re-investigate the setting, but perhaps not as either a prequel or sequel, but in some other way. To me, running this as a one-shot really felt like the sort of ambiguous SF short-stories I tend to enjoy.<br/><br/>As a one-shot, and one being run under a practical time-limit, I think the destiny points really pushed the players to bring lots of stuff together, while only roughly sketching out the greater backstory and surrounding issues.<br/><br/><br/>Another quick question: As you play, do you commonly include more areas/subjects for players to be the Canon-Protector over?<br/><br/>Hmm. Now thinking about random events, perhaps, that could be tied in to the Canon-Protector part? For example, something like Destiny Points, but each player creates a random event card or two related to their portfolio to create an overal deck of random events? Then, when a player calls for a random event, they draw two or more cards, and choose one to work in, much like with the character DPs?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179407/#Comment_179407" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-19T23:41:26+00:00" title="November 19, 2008 11:41PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Another quick question: As you play, do you commonly include more areas/subjects for players to be the Canon-Protector over?</blockquote>\nNo, I don't think I've ever seen that happen. I can definitely see that it might, though, so I think I'll include a little something about that in the rules.\n<blockquote>Now thinking about random events, perhaps, that could be tied in to the Canon-Protector part?</blockquote>\nOh, I like that.
