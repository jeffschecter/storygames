That said, I'm only halfway through book 4. :-)<br/><br/>Okay, so a quick disclaimer: while I've got some extensive experience in hacking Mouse Guard, I really don't want anyone thinking that what I'm saying is that this is the one true or right way to build a MG hack. I might slip into that mode, so please say something if you feel like that's going on. All I want to do here is walk through my own, personal MG hacking process in all its various steps. Hope this is interesting and useful. Please ask lots of questions.<br/><br/>1) The punch list.<br/><br/>First thing that lets me know if MG is going to be a good fit for a particular hack is to work through a little punch list I've worked out for myself. <br/><br/>* Do the characters owe loyalty to an outside authority?<br/>* Is this loyalty hard to fulfill based on the character's origins?<br/>* Do characters have their own ambitions? Do those ambitions come in conflict with their group loyalty? Can those ambitions contradict their origins?<br/>* Are there clearly identified ranks within the group? EDIT: When I mean "ranks" I mean ways of differentiating the characters in some social way, other than purely via skills. "Rank" is good if (dis)obeying authority is important, or if duty and leadership are how you're hooking into your "loyalty to an outside authority" concept. But it could also be age, or social strata, or pretty much anything.<br/>* Does the group receive orders from this outside authority?<br/><br/>I think that, if you have all those things, MG is a fine hack. The thing I'm looking for is three-way tension between mission, belief/goal (what I broadly consider "ambition" in my punch list) and Nature. If one of the legs of the stool is weak, the hack won't work right.<br/><br/>So for the Night's Watch from A Song of Ice and Fire, I think we can safely say all these things check out. The outside authority is the watch of course, being loyal to the Night's Watch is hard because nobody is really serving out of a desire to do so -- everyone's a bastard, or a criminal, or otherwise disgraced. I think in a roleplaying application, PCs can certainly have their own beliefs and goals, and fulfilling them is incredibly hard to do due to the strict nature of the Night's Watch's responsibilities and oath. Ranks, yup, but it's weak. There's the Lord Commander, his sergeant/maester/quartermaster type leadership, some veterans, and of course the recruits. <br/><br/>My feeling is that the Lord Commander is actually the Gwendolyn stand-in here -- nobody actually plays Lord Mormont or Lord Snow, but rather patrols get their orders from the top dog. So scratch that. Now you've got office-holders, veterans and recruits. It's a short list but not awful. Maybe I'd experiment with "townie" or some equivalent, the hangers-on who aren't in the Watch but whose lives are deeply dependent on the proximity of a Night's Watch castle or keep. It might be interesting to explore that tension a bit, folks who want to be helpful but have not taken the oath...let's circle back to that later.<br/><br/>So for me, 1) is done. It's a good fit and the layout is fairly obvious.<br/><br/>Next up, Nature.<br/><br/>EDIT: Watch not Guard.

IMO a straight Nature (Human) has proven to be wicked-hard because the players are human, and most hackers hesitate to make the strong editorial statement about being human required here. It might also not be the right tension -- Nature (Mouse) works just fine in Mouse Guard because the mouse-ness is the core challenge to their heroism. Race or species is almost certainly not the case with the Night's Watch.<br/><br/>So where I like to start is to figure out what makes it hard to be a Night's Watch:<br/><br/>* Very strict oath.<br/>* Total isolation from your previous world.<br/>* Distrust of your fellow scumbag recruits.<br/>* Lack of resources, generally poor equipment, shitty living conditions.<br/>* A threat that outsiders don't believe in; lack of credibility.<br/><br/>Okay so let's just table this stuff for now. My next step is to think about the shittiest, yet most useful, things a Night's Watch might want to do. I'm not worried too much about tight game-actionable verbs at this point, just want to get some ideas floating around.<br/><br/>* Run away or otherwise act cowardly<br/>* Disobey orders<br/>* Throw fellow black brothers under the bus when things go bad<br/>* Indulge one's ego<br/>* Break the Oath<br/><br/>Huh...now that's an interesting place to start. Let's look at the Night Watch's oath and see if there's anything good in there:<br/><br/><code>Night gathers, and now my watch begins. <br/>It shall not end until my death. <br/>I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. <br/>I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. <br/>I shall live and die at my post. <br/>I am the sword in the darkness. <br/>I am the watcher on the walls. <br/>I am the fire that burns against cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men. <br/>I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.</code><br/><br/>On second thought, this might be left entirely in the fiction of the game, like the Mouse Guard oath. I'd think about putting it somewhere prominent on the character sheet.<br/><br/>Back to our shitty-yet-useful list, then. <br/><br/>* <i>Running away</i>, yeah. Easy and done! <br/>* <i>Disobey</i>? Maybe? Worth experimenting with. <br/>* Throwing your fellow brothers under the bus is very human...this is where, IMO, we're in the realm of editorializing about being human. You want a good verb that is value-neutral and very specific, so you don't have to spend any time evaluating it during play. I'd go with <i>Lying</i>, since that's a really great verb for facilitating all kinds of bad behavior -- including framing people. breaking oaths, being cowardly, and indulging one's ego. It's generally useful. This is a bit like the "foraging" verb in Mouse Guard -- it's actually pretty useful. Not all the verbs need to be "bad".<br/>* Don't know what that last verb might be. Ideas?<br/><br/>Then I think through what the 0 and 7 ranks might look like in the game. These might not be obvious until the end, though, because sometimes a total flip-over is just what you need. Given the above verb list, when you're at 6 you're a very accomplished cowardly, disobedient, lying jerk. You're well on your way to escaping the Watch entirely, probably, which results in life on the run, or execution as a traitor. That's a pretty cool way to call it game-over. 0 is interesting as well, a total sublimation of all these bad things. Do you become a Platonic ideal of a Night's Watchsman? Ooh...maybe you become a martyr of the Night's Watch, and die selflessly in some final blaze of glory.<br/><br/>I'm not persuaded that I'm "done" with hacking out Nature here, particularly since we're missing a nice, snappy, actionable verb that will facilitate a Watchman in his moment of weakness. But I feel like this stuff is really important to hammer out before proceeding too much further.<br/><br/>My next step would be to figure out what the ranks look like next, but I'll pause for a bit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_352405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352405/#Comment_352405" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-23T22:38:58+00:00" title="December 23, 2011 10:38PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very interesting, this also gives some good insight into MG itself.<br/><br/>Isn't it the Night's Watch?<br/><br/>While there doesn't seem to be much rank in the Watch, there are some key positions, as you've mentioned (Lord Commander, First Ranger).  But there are a few lines from the books I've read so far that make me see two additional features of the Night's Watch.  First, if you're noble-born or knighted then you have higher status.  Second, seniority is a big deal, or at least perceived to be by some.  Are named ranks important though as long as everyone knows who reports to who?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cneph" title="Cneph"><img alt="Cneph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cneph">Cneph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352412/#Comment_352412" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-24T00:06:02+00:00" title="December 24, 2011 12:06AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 24, 2011 12:53AM by Cneph.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like Running Away (Fleeing?) as one of the options.  The black brother at the begining of the series obviously escapes the white walkers by tapping his Nature.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>There are three orders in the Night's Watch.<br/>Rangers<br/>Stewards<br/>Builders<br/>with some perceived hierarchies and levels of respect, perhaps.  Is the game just about playing Rangers?  They are the ones out on missions.  Builders and Stewards could provide much of the NPC cast?- Stewards are the most numerous, and they're the ones who can shoe your horse, provide a sharp sword, and decide what food you get for a ranging.  Probably good material for Circles/Resources here.  Going from <a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Night%27s_Watch#Structure" rel="nofollow">this</a>.<br/><br/>Resources- rather than money, is this in effect how well you get on with the local Quartermaster?<br/><br/>Also, I could see tension between the indentured and the (few) volunteers.  Likewise the noble-born/knighted vs commoner.  I'd imagine most volunteers are noble.<br/><br/>Some sort of ranks?<br/>Recruit (may not even have taken the oath, if a volunteer?  How would that work?)  Equate to Tenderpaws in that their old lives haven't been drilled out of them completely, yet.<br/>Black Brother (probably a Recruit achieves this if they survive their first Ranging).<br/>[need another rank or two here?]  [edit- this is the Noble/Knight rank?  The list of background skills and things are different, the character 'ranks' like a Patrol Guard.  Might not actually be 'better' statistically than Black Brother, with some enforced skill choices from knightly knowledge like Heraldry, Etiquette and the like.  Still subject to the patrol leader, who may be a commoner, but outrank commoner Black Brothers.  Introduces some tension right there, you can't move into this rank if you are a commoner, but a noble Recruit jumps right up here in the informal ranking system.  Can we call it 'Ser'?<br/>Patrol Leader (name??)<br/>First Ranger (like Guard Captain, table agreement only, etc etc).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_352418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352418/#Comment_352418" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-24T03:20:47+00:00" title="December 24, 2011  3:20AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 24, 2011 3:29AM by Teataine.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Paul, I made <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ARsqDFKJlqu3gxxkRmXwWiZ5E8Ugu6X1rbirTfrHYVM/edit" rel="nofollow">this</a> almost exactly two years ago.

You went in a similar direction with Nature as Patrick did with Realm Guard -- I personally am skeptical of this approach because we've tried it and found it very difficult to evaluate during actual play. But they're all good angles, and if you had a GM with a strong pimp hand you could probably keep players from abusing these concepts. I just found, through lots of playtesting, that using motives rather than verbs for your Nature is just an invitation to argue at the table. Anyway, just my $0.02.<br/><br/>* * * * *<br/><br/>I like the idea of one's nobility being sort of...perpendicular to one's seniority. That is in the fiction so it should be in the game as well.<br/><br/>We could just leave it inside the fiction, and maybe make "noble heritage" a choice during character creation (coming up, but a good ways down the list). If we can put some mechanical teeth on that tension I think that's worth exploring.<br/><br/>Some ideas:<br/><br/>* Add a little metamechanical ritual to the game. I did this in my MGSF hack and it works really well. First one that comes to mind: a Noble makes *every* Circles test, even if they're not the one who "came up with" the idea of Circling someone. Then maybe bake in some additional factors into the Night's Watch-specific Circles rules that reflects the likelihood of invoking enmity for Nobles Circling fellow guardsmen.<br/><br/>* Build this tension into Nature, perhaps as the fourth verb: "Defer to better blood" or something. I think that's interesting, and broad enough to encompass smallfolk defering to any old Ser, and lesser nobles defering to Lords.<br/><br/>* Consider adding a "nobility" attribute to run alongside will, health, resources and circles. Not sure what I'd do with it. Maybe fold it into the Circles hack above, and make it work like an "infamous reputation" from BW: a bonus when Circling up fellow Nobles, a penalty when Circling up smallfolk. Maybe even make it a -3 to +3 thing, with notorious smallfolk criminals getting negatives that work in the opposite way. This would get set via questionnaire during chargen.<br/><br/>I'd probably run control groups using these rules individually, then try putting them together. Sometimes small rules synergize in surprising ways.<br/><br/>But this is also totally off-the-cuff! How else might we leverage the tension between breeding and seniority?<br/><br/>This actually is a good lead-in to the next thing I wanted to talk about: Hazards!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_352440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352440/#Comment_352440" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-24T10:26:10+00:00" title="December 24, 2011 10:26AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 24, 2011 10:27AM by PaulB.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            3) Hazards.<br/><br/>So in Mouse Guard you have four main families of things that the patrol will face: mice, animal, wilderness and weather. In the abstract, these are nice breakdowns: intelligent adversity, non-intelligent active adversity, passive adversity, and setting-changing events. <br/><br/>The easy thing to do would be to just map these directly over, with some guidelines and specifics perhaps regarding the various settings in which the game will take place. To my mind you've basically got the following settings to consider:<br/><br/>* The Keep/The Wall -- the few civilized trappings of the Night's Watch. The little villages that gather around the keep as well. Can't remember what those are called.<br/>* Wildling territory -- villages, encampments, caravans<br/>* Deep northron wilderness -- pretty much where The Others are, and wild mastadons and all the rest of the high(er)-fantasy weirdness<br/><br/>Are there other areas to consider? Dunno. This is what popped into my head. <br/><br/>So anyway, a good first step is to look at our settings in context with each of the standard MG hazards. Seems pretty obvious they're all a good fit.<br/><br/>But...what if we mess with this a little? Just for laffs. The reason I'm thinking about this is that AGOT is very social, very interpersonal. You never *really* see the characters struggling to deal with animals and monsters. <br/><br/>The weather is pretty core to the whole theme of the novel, but not just any weather: Winter. Winter is coming. Winter is *always* coming. For the Night's Watch, I'd rejigger the "weather" hazard to just <b>Winter</b>. I'd probably also consider the weather hazard economy from MG, maybe break it into phases of the Watch throughout a Winter: early winter (2 hazards max), full winter (3 hazards max), deep dark winter (5 hazards), early spring (2 hazards).<br/><br/>We were talking a bit about that setting tension between the nobility and the Night's Watch. There are nobles within the Watch, and while allegedly they've given up their nobility, nobody really believes that. There's also the tension very broadly between the needs of the Watch and the (un)willingness of the various kings to step up and do the right thing. So...maybe one of our hazards is: <b>Nobility</b>.<br/><br/>Then you've got the Wildlings of course. Duh. Hunting packs, caravans, scouting patrols, cultural heroes, etc. So: <b>Wildlings</b>.<br/><br/>Finally, I think you could get a lot of traction from having <b>Smallfolk</b> as their own hazard. Criminals, townies, etc. <br/><br/>So now we don't have "wilderness" or "animal" hazards, and I'm okay-ish with that. Intuitively it seems like "wilderness" should be a good fit. I'm thinking about scenes like where Jon Snow is sneaking around up in the mountains trying to get the drop on the Wildlings. Book 2 maybe?<br/><br/>Maybe that means dropping "Smallfolk", or combining them with "Wildlings."

Not a bad thing, per <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>.<br/>3) When you bypass verbs and go to motives, Nature becomes too on-the-nose. There's no room for the players to explore their characters' Nature when you go straight to their motive. I have found, and again this is only personal anecdotes, that you can get a lot of mileage out of taking the motive you want to hit and find verbs that facilitate the motive, rather than the motive itself. So like...what specific game-actionable verbs might one use to seek safety, comfort, romantic love, etc?<br/>4) One more reason to use verbs and not motives: It cuts way down on handling time in actual play. When a GM has to assess an action as being within Nature, you're basically inviting the GM and player to discuss (and most likely argue about) motive.<br/><br/>I ran into this in an early hack where I was looking for a Nature (Human). I went to first principles of human nature as they're understood by our legal system: stuff like humans <i>being selfish</i>. Okay so we're playing the hack, right? And someone wants to shoot an NPC. They've specifically avoided taking the Fighter-analogue because they're trying to game the Nature system as it is written in this early hack. I'm GMing and I'm like "wait what? You think shooting this NPC is you being selfish? How?" And then he comes back about how he needs to kill this dude to get what he wants, and that's the definition of selfishness. My response as GM, of course, was that that meant that literally everything he wanted to do that wasn't following someone else's orders was an act of selfishness. Which is absurd. Which then led us to a discussion about the difference between pursuing our self-interests versus taking what we want at someone else's expense. Which then led us to the discussion of whether murdering this NPC was taking something at the NPC's expense, or just a necessary act in pursuit of self-interest...<br/><br/>...Blah blah blah. This was easily 30 minutes and it did not resolve itself in any sort of satisfactory manner. If you're rolling your eyes right now, I don't blame you! But it showed itself over and over as long as I kept trying to load motives into Nature. <br/><br/>So that's why I prefer verbs. :-) I also prefer they be value-neutral. So you may disagree that "lying" is a value-neutral verb, but it's way more value-neutral than say "bullshitting someone" or "blaming someone" or whatever. <br/><br/>All that said, and man it took a while to get there I know, I do like that safety, comfort and love are all motives that would be good to facilitate via the Nature mechanics. Facilitate, rather than outright resolve. So what do you think some good safety-facilitating verbs are? How about comfort-facilitating? More interestingly, love-facilitating?<br/><br/>Think also about what those verbs might look like at the table. Will it be very easy for the GM to assess? It's pretty clear when you're "running away," but maybe not so clear when you're "extending your trust". <br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352504/#Comment_352504" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-26T11:40:10+00:00" title="December 26, 2011 11:40AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 26, 2011 11:40AM by jenskot.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't have much to add.

Lots to think about here. <br/><br/>Ranks are useful in MG and they probably should map over to Night's Watch. They help reinforce the whole duty-and-loyalty theme of the source fiction.<br/><br/>Gregor has already done some work here:<br/><br/><code>Age and rank                Will and Health<br/>Youngster 14-17                2 6<br/>Watchman 18-25               3 5<br/>Patrol Watchman 21-50      4 4<br/>Patrol Leader 21-60            5 4<br/>Watch Captain 41-60          6 3</code><br/><br/>Nice clean reskin. For consistency with the source material, I'd propose renaming "watch captain" to "First Ranger." <br/><br/>We should probably hack our way through the character questionnaire as well, but that is uh...more work than may be first apparent. The end goal is to get a reasonable spread of skill points while also funneling certain skills into certain ranks. So before we get into the questionnaire, let's look at skills.<br/><br/>What I found, doing my last couple big hacks (but especially MGSF), is that MG's skills are basically broken into four lists:<br/><br/>Patrol skills -- these are printed on the character sheet and automatically take up several of the 24 (?) max skill slots.<br/>"Special" skills -- these typically are what get funneled specifically into individual ranks. They're as game-important as patrol skills but they're keyed to ranks.<br/>Craft skills -- skills where you make things. Hands-on stuff. Boatwright, cartographer, etc.<br/>Trade skills -- skills where you gather things or otherwise sort of ... manage stuff. Not so hands-on. Apiarist, loremouse, etc.<br/><br/>Crafts and trades are there mostly to provide colorful help to fellow patrol characters. Maybe the players will roll them to pursue a goal. But mostly, practically, they're color. They're also tied to locations and are part of the whole questionnaire process. In MG every town has a trade and a craft, and when you pick your town you're picking your set. That might be interesting to do in a Night's Watch hack -- but rather than specific locations, maybe this is a place where we can bring in the wide variety of potential Watchers and their backgrounds.<br/><br/>Smallfolk Criminal<br/>Disgraced Noble<br/>Bastard<br/>Exotic -- I don't recall any Braavosi or Dothraki serving on the Night's Watch, but why not? Could be cool. I'd restrict this, personally, to just one on the patrol. Make the exotic, exotic. Otherwise I'm pretty sure you'd end up with parties of special snowflakes, and then nobody's special.<br/><br/>Just thinking out loud at this point. What other interesting origins might the Watchmen have?<br/><br/>Since this is a divergence from the pick-a-town system in MG, I'd probably then want to see our list of skills and then assign them, somehow, to the different backgrounds.<br/><br/>So what about skills? The MG basic list is pretty good. We'll want to get rid of the mouse-specific stuff like Loremouse, Apiarist and so on. We'll also want to brainstorm stuff that's more suited to the Song of Ice and Fire setting: maester (probably just replaces loremouse), raven management (need a better name for this but it's probably a good replacement for Apiarist) and so on. What else?<br/><br/>At this point I'd probably also start brainstorming good -wises: Noble-wise (maybe even specific -wises for each house), wildlings-wise, winter-wise, omens-wise...this is a fun exercise. What else should go on this list?<br/><br/>Traits! Huge fun but I want to come back to this as its own subject in a bit.<br/><br/>Once we have our ranks, skills, wises and some basic ideas about our questionnaire, we're really pretty close to having a working model of character creation. Balance between ranks isn't super important, at least not numerical balance: senior officers tend to have more skills but they're mostly in -wises or specialty skills that aren't as core-useful as Patrol skills. I put together an analysis of all the different kinds of skills and assets each rank got in MG once, if anyone's curious to see how it breaks down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352730/#Comment_352730" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-29T12:09:39+00:00" title="December 29, 2011 12:09PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            5) Traits<br/><br/>It looks like this workshop is pretty much played out, at least for the holiday season, but I wanted to post one more thing I ran into in my own hacking: picking Traits.<br/><br/>Skill picking, tricky. Nature hacking, we know how tricky that is. Traits are IMO the great unexplored space in MG hackdom.<br/><br/>In practice, a trait is like a fine-tuning of Nature. It can help or hinder you, but the economies that push and pull the player are totally different. The Nature decision is, or should be, existential: <i>my loyalty/responsibility says I need to do X but I can succeed if I do Y</i>. The trait decision, otoh, is IMO more often a choice between succeeding at this thing I'm doing for my group, versus failing my group so I can pursue my own responsibilities. The tension feels different, so Traits should facilitate that tension.<br/><br/>In Mouse Guard, IIRC, there are two different trait lists: one with traits that help outline younger guards, and one for older guards. Is that right? It's been a while. I think it is. Looking at the "origins of the black brother" thing I posted up there a second ago, I'm thinking maybe origins-specific trait lists would be interesting.<br/><br/>So what would be good Traits for smallfolk criminals? Traits that would make that player choose between helping his brothers versus screwing things up for his brothers so he can do his own stuff? Ideally they'd all be two-edged but it might not be possible. <i>Greedy, horny, disrespectful</i>: I think some of the minor smallfolk we see in the Night's Watch all showed these sorts of dudes but they're all check-mines. So I'd probably follow up with stuff like <i>independent, rugged</i> and <i>clever</i>. It's sort of on the player at that point to take a good mix of "good" and "bad" traits, so they can continue earning checks. If you don't give them any chance to earn checks, they're screwed right out of the gate. Hence the Platonic ideal of ambiguous good/bad Traits.<br/><br/>Disgraced Nobles: The list might look like stuff along the lines of <i>clever, resentful, scheming, well-fed, lazy</i>, and so on.<br/><br/>Bastards: Hm! Jon Snow is the main example of this character so he's what I'll go by. Trait-y things relative to his bastardy that come to mind: <i>stubborn, resentful, entitled, alienated</i> etc. <br/><br/>Exotic: No examples in the book so this is the realm of pure creation: <i>Alienated, dark-skinned, lithe,</i> etc.<br/><br/>There are several crossovers between lists here, and I think that's a good thing. It's nice that, say, <i>resentful</i> ties together bastards and disgraced nobles, for example. Or that both criminals and disgraced nobles can be <i>clever</i>. The four lists don't need to be unique to one another, but the total different unique traits should be a smallish number.<br/><br/>The target total # of traits needs to be smallish so that we can funnel play into a fairly narrow range. I think the list in MG and MGSF is like ... 40 total. That's not a ton of traits. Luckily we don't need to playtest or balance them, since all traits are mechanically identical. What we do need to do, though, is load-balance the list. And that comes from testing, lots of testing. If there are traits that just nobody bothers taking, they need to disappear from the list. If there are traits that *everyone* takes, you need to look at how they're being used. Sometimes they're just too broad and facile. You want your trait choices to be quirky and unique, not obvious must-haves. <br/><br/>Stuff I like to pay attention to:<br/><br/>* A selection of social, physical and personality traits -- at least for a simpler MG hack.<br/>* An even mix of purely "good" and purely "bad" traits<br/>* A good portion of the total traits are ambiguous, easily read to be either good or bad. "Stubborn" is a good example: your tenacity can see you through a problem, or make you stick to something too long. <br/><br/>So what other traits might fit into the nobles, criminals, bastards and exotic backgrounds?<br/><br/>This has been mostly a Paul-gives-a-hack-lecture thread, which is fine for starters. But I do very much hope others will feel like they can jump in with additional ideas, items to fill in lists and so forth.<br/><br/>Happy holidays all,<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/3Jane" title="3Jane"><img alt="3Jane" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/3Jane">3Jane</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353014/#Comment_353014" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-03T05:08:31+00:00" title="January  3, 2012  5:08AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, I wonder, why do you see group ranks necessary to a Mouseguard hack?<br/><br/>(I'm asking because I'm working on a hack myself and I don't see much of a possibility or desire for ranks in that particular setting; I'm wondering how much this might break the game).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353023/#Comment_353023" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-03T08:10:59+00:00" title="January  3, 2012  8:10AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 3, 2012 8:38AM by PaulB.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the Nights Watch hack specifically, having ranks gives you a handle in the game to grab for addressing group loyalty, obedience, and so on. I feel like that pops up a lot in the source material, although the Watch does have a flat-ish structure. <br/><br/>I don't think ranks per se are required, but I do think something requiring loyalty to a group is necessary. I'm sure you could come up with structures that would allow character diversity without doing it along formal rank lines. For example, I'm doing an occult-investigators hack where I just use age as my diiferentiator.<br/><br/>EDIT: I realize this contradicts my first post! So I'm going to go back up there and clarify a bit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
