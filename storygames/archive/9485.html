I personally am still tweaking out my \u201cStory Game System\u201d and the oracle games have given me some great ideas to adding on to my services I plan. The way I want to fit oracle games in would be:<br/>\n<br/>\n\u201cStory Game System\u201d core rules for free with expanded print edition.<br/>\nSupplements would come in 4 flavors<br/>\n<br/>\nShort Stories \uf0df (the oracle game) super cheapo with some smattering of lexicon words to evoke a concept, and some rules to bridge them to the story game system. This would be an ultra cheapo thing like around a dollar if even that. The short story would include attached document of cards that can be printed out and have individual lexicon words or phrases that when combined like a deck with other short stories could be shuffled and dealt out to create unique oracle games.<br/>\n<br/>\nNovellas \uf0df More detail on the setting in the form of a detailed adventure that incorporates the lexicon information from the short story.<br/>\n<br/>\nNovels \uf0df Loads of detail expanding on the base concepts as this will be a full campaign, detailing a bit beyond the lexicon.<br/>\n<br/>\nSagas \uf0df This would just be a bundle of the above.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Any way with all the buzz about this little micro games I thought I would see what other people had in mind as far as what to do with them. <br/>\n<br/>\n~Seth~                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210254/#Comment_210254" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-03T19:00:21+00:00" title="June  3, 2009  7:00PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seth -- Check out <a href="http://billwhite.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">Consensus Games</a>, my design blog.
