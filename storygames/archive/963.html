                    Hi all,<br/><br/>Recently I bought Burning Wheel, which looks very good.  Rules heavy, but that isn't intrinsically a problem for me if they are good rules that are there for a reason, which seems true here.<br/><br/>I read the first 77 pages like the game recommends, I've created an example character, now the book recommends I now run a trial session but there are no rules for combat in the first 77 pages and the rules for bloody contests come later too (as does armour, damage and lots of other fairly vital stuff).  I'm a little unclear how I can run a trial game with no combats, no duels of wits, and yet get a feel for how it plays.  I'm not sure how one follows that advice.<br/><br/>The other thing is the game makes an assumption that the entire group will be reading the rules together and so on, that's not really practical for me, like many groups I as GM introduce people to a new game if I am pitching it and part of that is helping people get the rules.  We don't set homework for each other.  So, if I want to run it I need to explain the rules as we go along, which means I need to know them.<br/><br/>And they are legion.<br/><br/>So, the whole first 77 pages thing right now isn't quite working for me as I can only run a game in which there are no martial or social conflicts using that.  So what else minimum do people recommend I learn before giving this game a try with my group?                </div>

                            I read pretty much everything before running my first BW session. I had decided to the "The Sword" demo from the BW wiki. The demo requires you to understand basic tests, Duel fo Wits, and Fight! The adventure is set up so that, ideally, you're messing around with simple Versus tests before you get into debates or combats. It also is designed to progress from simple stuff (tests) to slighty more complex stuff that introduces scripting (Duel of Wits), and finally to the most complex stuff (Fight!). It also avoids involving any Sorcery, which is best saved for when you know the system better.<br/><br/>So, I'd say go ahead and read the whole ruleset. Just don't try and use ALL of it the first time through with your group. Technically, you can just use the first 77 pages, though. Everything that happens is simply a Versus test. However, the real meat of BW is in things like DoW and Fight!, so it's fun to slowly bring those in as well.<br/><br/>Anyway, I think the basic advice in the rules is sound. Mess with tests first, and then run some sample combats and DoW. Don't try and launch a full-on campiagn the first time you use the system.<br/><br/>I've run "The Sword" twice so far, and I can tell you that BW is a lot simpler in play than it reads on paper.                        </div>

                            Really focus on the use of setting Stakes, Helping dice, ForKs, Linked Tests and Artha.   What that provides is the framework for play- player input, strategizing skill and ability use, and reward for roleplaying BITs.  Remind players of their options during play, many players are not used to being able to set stakes, or use stuff like, "Animal-Wise" to get bonuses to fight a wolf, or get rewards on the spot for roleplaying, "My sword does not rest until my father sleeps soundly in his grave", etc.<br/><br/>If you want to use some of the crunch, I suggest using the combat system without the distancing/positioning or stances.  That's usually crunchy enough to engage most players and get them to latch on to the strategizing.                        </div>

                            You can do combat with simple versus tests. Either, if you just take the first 77 pages, you just decide the whole combat with one roll, or you add the injury rules and use the winner's margin of success for the IMS calculation.                        </div>

                            Balbinus, we just hopped straight in and played 'The Sword' with the pregens. Scripted combat and all. Are you comfortable with running a session like that? Because I often find it's the best way to learn a game--if your group can cooperate.<br/><br/>I remember learning a lot of games like this in the old days. Don't people do this any more?                        </div>

                            Yeh. I downloaded "The Sword," Duel of Wits sheets, and Fight! sheets. We had a couple of versus tests to see who got to the sword first, and then they started arguing and we went through Duel of Wits, then the loser of the DoW stabbed the other guy and we used Fight!<br/><br/>The sheets help so much, because they have all the manouvers on them. I basically just looked up the interactions, and didn't have to (f'rex) read out every option to the players before they could make a decision.<br/><br/>To directly answer your "no martial or social conflicts" concern, you use simple Versus tests for everything. So, if a character gets in a fight, you do a Brawl versus test. An argument, you test Persuasion versus Oratory. And so on.<br/><br/>Hope that helps.                        </div>
