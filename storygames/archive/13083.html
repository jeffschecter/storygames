UE fans!<br/><br/>When I love a game, I toy around with things that might help my game-gang enjoy the game even more. So now and then I come up with player and Narrator aids.<br/><br/>This is the first that I've created for BASH! UE.<br/><a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/38298266/Bash-Up-Build-Heroic-Narrator-Aids-By-Heroic" rel="nofollow">Heroic Narrator Aid of Iconic Marvel &amp; DC stats</a><br/><br/><br/>Please take a look, offer suggestions - on anything from the content to design or ease of use, etc... I'm always looking to improve my ideas.<br/><br/>In the meantime - THIS little document is inspired by the classic game - Marvel Super Heroes RPG by TSR.  The Campaign Guide to be exact.  As a kid I loved looking at the descriptions of base character statistics and not only reading but seeing my favorite character beside the stat.  It really made me remember the power of each rank.<br/>I've done the same here - with both Marvel and DC, several of the most iconic characters from those comic book universes as well as a few of my favs tossed in!<br/>This may help you and your game groups to understand the BASH! UE game a little better and at the same time give you a reference on where YOUR own original hero or villain might rank comparatively.<br/><br/>For more on BASH! UE visit the <a href="http://bashtalk.org/index.php" rel="nofollow">BASH! forums</a>!<br/><br/>I hope you enjoy it.  I have several other ideas that will be coming...  For now - BASH IT UP!!<br/><br/><br/>enjoy,<br/>kevin perrine<br/><br/>-kev-<br/>"...with great power..."                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
