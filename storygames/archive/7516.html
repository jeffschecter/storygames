(Based on expectations for sales they each chose to do 200 copies.) Additional print runs require a new contract.</li><li>My name goes on the cover as the author, and their translation has to be faithful to my text. If they feel additional rules clarification or play examples are important, they have to be clearly indicated as text not of my authorship. (I suggested achieving this via footnotes. Eero did it via grey boxes, and  I didn't have a problem with that. And actually, I don't think Michele and Claudia did this at all, other than including an introduction written by Michele.)</li><li>They do their own cover, their own layout, and their own illustrations. (I don't own rights to Colin's or Will's artwork for anything other than the English language version of My Life with Master, and for promoting the game and Half Meme Press.)</li><li>They make a single up front payment to me. It is a percentage of the expected gross revenue from the selling of the whole print run.</li><li>I get a few copies of the final product.</li></ol>\nSo, no rights to selling a pdf version, or for doing an adapted translation.<br/><br/>I've had a number of translation requests and they're almost always laden with ongoing nuisances. Lots of guys want to do pdf-only translations and make monthly payments to me for pdf sales, for instance. I don't want a fucking marriage. I don't want monthly accounting. I don't want the anxiety of having to track whether the other guy has paid me this month or not. I want someone to do the translation as a project. I want them to be smart enough to know how many copies they want to print. I want them to pay me up front. And if they do a great job, then I'm going to have no problem doing another contract with them.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166879/#Comment_166879" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-03T17:07:49+00:00" title="September  3, 2008  5:07PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As an aside, Claudia hooked me initially with an awesomely indie offer. She would do a bunch of lavish illustrations for Bacchanal in exchange for translation rights to Bacchanal and My Life with Master. She's an awesome artist. I gave her some art direction and she did a piece. And it made me realize her style doesn't fit what I want to do with Bacchanal. I was pretty disappointed, because she so clearly shares my same creator-owner values and I really really loved the idea of artwork for translation rights.

Insofar as hobby publishing goes (which translating to Finnish very much is), a fixed up-front payment per-printing makes sense. The only things that come to mind in addition...\n<ul>\n<li>Get a contract in writing as soon as possible. Some designers have a distressing habit of backing out of a deal for the most spurious reasons, which can get just brutal if you've already sunk a hundred hours of work on the project at the time he decides that he doesn't want you messing around with his game after all. Not that I'd probably do much with a contract, even, but it might offer some incentive to the designer to take the work of others seriously. This is, historically, the single greatest problem I've faced when doing this stuff.</li>\n<li>Get the vital data, such as Paypal address, snail mail address and anything else you need for logistics out of the guy as soon as possible. Trying to get some of these guys to answer straightforward questions (or even acknowledge that they've got email) is like drawing teeth, and sometimes they disappear in ways that seem rather improbable - we've still to even <em>pay</em> for one project where the designer disappeared between signing the contract and providing his Paypal address for paying him. Just flat out disappeared from the face of the earth, insofar as I could discern.</li>\n<li>Have enough time between finishing the translation and printing it for approval rounds. We haven't really messed this up majorly yet, but I'd like for the designer to have ample time to suggest anything and have a real chance at getting his corrections; in our style of translation the designer really has just as much of a hand in the book design and such as he wants to.</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Grant%20Davis" title="Grant Davis"><img alt="Grant Davis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Grant%20Davis">Grant Davis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166918/#Comment_166918" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T04:46:43+00:00" title="September  4, 2008  4:46AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would get it verified, then buy the translation and publish it myself. -Grant                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166927/#Comment_166927" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T06:32:03+00:00" title="September  4, 2008  6:32AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul Czege</cite>include a shout out to www.halfmeme.com.</blockquote>\nDo you (any of you game designers) maintain a list of links to the translations of your games on your main site?

I have it now on authority I trust that Germans aren't particularly resistant to buying English language RPGs. And I've heard from Spaniards, Portuguese, and Italians that they learned English as part of their involvement in the roleplaying hobby. The authority I trust has run lots of convention games of My Life with Master in Germany, and informs me the actual resistance is to using PayPal to order games from overseas, something that would certainly have been part of my plan for a German language edition if I'd done one.<br/><br/>The reason to license a translation is because the translator knows whether the English language text is actually a barrier to the game in their home country (or they wouldn't be soliciting you for translation rights), and because indie games succeed from the way they're actively represented to the market. I couldn't have participated in the German RPG community and represented a German language My Life with Master to German gamers the way Eero represents his Finnish translation to Finnish gamers and the way Claudia and Michele represent their Italian translation to gamers in Italy.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167003/#Comment_167003" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T10:57:51+00:00" title="September  4, 2008 10:57AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Jamey,\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Marhault</cite>Do you (any of you game designers) maintain a list of links to the translations of your games on your main site?

Just dealing with language, though, it's impossible to avoid some change.  An overly literal translation will change the tone of the text, for example.  And when there are no one-to-one correspondences between words, the translation of the names of key game concepts can, unavoidably, change their flavor.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am wondering about RPG-specific issues in translation.  A game that was originally targeted for one audience could have cultural assumptions built into it that would make the game difficult for someone from another culture.  Aren't there cases where some kind of cultural translation would be necessary?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor an example of this, I will mention the French translation of <i>Over the Edge</i>, which I only know about through the review by Philippe Tromeur (<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.rpg.net/news+reviews/reviews/rev_7273.html" rel="nofollow">rpg.net review of Over the Edge</a>).  This edition has made major changes to the setting, apparently to retain the necessary suspension of disbelief for a European Francophone audience.  It appears to be a very successful translation of the game, as opposed to a translation of the text.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis could be a very rare case of a game author willing to accept such changes, willing to work very closely with the translator and having confidence in the translator based on their reputation and past work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167408/#Comment_167408" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-06T09:15:35+00:00" title="September  6, 2008  9:15AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Yasha</cite><br>This could be a very rare case of a game author willing to accept such changes, willing to work very closely with the translator and having confidence in the translator based on their reputation and past work.</br></blockquote>\nThis is exactly how we are doing Maid (non-indie) and Tenra Bansho (indie). <br>With Maid, they were like, "Sure, change whatever you need to make this game acceptable to a western audience".
