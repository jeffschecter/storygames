Sometimes these members only have a single defining role and sometimes they are a bit more complex, filling numerous roles at once. <br/><br/>Here are a few I've come up with:<br/><br/><b>Leader</b> The guy who calls the shots<br/><b>Veteran</b> Guy with years of experience<br/><b>Rookie</b> No experience, trying to prove himself<br/><b>Loyal</b> The guy the leader can count on to back him up<br/><b>Outsider</b> Doesn't have the trust of the rest of the group<br/><b>Joker</b> Doesn't take things seriously, goofs off<br/><b>Mysterious</b> The quiet guy that no one really knows much about<br/><b>Professional</b> Stays on task, gets the job done<br/><b>Wanna-be leader</b> Always questions the leaders authority<br/><b>Coward</b> When the going gets tough, so does he <br/><b>The Whiner</b> When the situation is bleak, he'll make sure you know how bleak it is<br/><b>Peacemaker</b> Friend to everyone, tries to calm inter-group conflicts<br/><b>Rogue</b> Is in it for himself, not the group<br/><b>Heavy</b> The big guy<br/><b>Spiritual</b> The guy who has more faith in a higher power than in the group itself<br/><b>Wise</b> The teacher or sage of the group<br/><b>Greedy</b> Always looking to pick up a few extra bucks along the way<br/><b>Hot head</b> Easily angered, unpredictable<br/><b>Lone Wolf</b> Prefers to work alone<br/><b>Brain</b> Uses brains instead of brawn<br/><br/>I know there are more.

He's not just the tough guy. He doesn't want it any other way.<br/><br/><b>Bastard:</b> Everyone hates him (with good reason), but he's just too important for the job.<br/><br/><b>The Mentor:</b> He's not just a grizzled veteran, he likes sharing his experiences with the young and naive. He can be rough and cynical, but he means well. (Might or might not die before the end.)<br/><br/><b>The Rival:</b> He wants what you want, he needs what you need, he knows what you need to know. He wants to see you fall, but in a fair fight and by being superior to you.<br/><br/><b>Bootlicker:</b> He's too weak, coward, opportunist or stupid to survive on his own, so he is always trying to be on the good side of those able to (sometimes a little too much for their liking). Might turn the traitor or the mole with ease.<br/><br/><b>The fool:</b> He is not the smartest pea in the pot. In fact, he is way too dense and close-minded, and his ideas could lead to certain catastrophe. Everyone knows that... except him. (He's just convinced no one else understands his geniality.)<br/><br/><b>The Diva:</b> He's here for the glory, the fame and the attention. He's more concerned about looking good and not loosing face, than about getting the job done. He's good at what he does most of the time, but when he fails he's easy to anger when someone criticizes him.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
