And I realized that it's only possible if the rules are changing.<br/><br/>Which means that if a totally new situation arrises, there shall be a totally new set of rules for totally new mechanics.<br/><br/>Like when there was the first Star Trek episode which had Romulans in them. That was totally like a cold war submarine thriller drama, like Red October. So you had to dump the Star Trek rules (well, most of them, but keeping the baseline) and take the submarine rules instead.<br/><br/>If you as a GM want to give the players totally new experience in a scene, then you have to create totally new rules system for that scene. Every time. You can't just use the old rules every time. So the rules have to be intuitive or learnable or something like that, and the GM needs some kind of "meta-rules" which help to create rules.<br/><br/>I think that the tests and challanges of FATE are going in this way (as I can build very different tests and challenges), although the basic mechanism stays the same.<br/><br/>What do you think? Is it possible to create working and exciting new rules on a long term on a weekly or bi-weekly basis? Maybe the players learning curve could be used as the new rules' testing curve. Each adventure would be a new rules system which culminates in the final session when the players learned to use the new rules set quite well and the rules got refined by the players playing it. The question is how should it be done without getting disasterous results? How slow should the rules be developed to stay with them on the safe ground, that they won't have to get dumped, but can be refined for the first go?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233241/#Comment_233241" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-19T22:39:01+00:00" title="September 19, 2009 10:39PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>What do you think?

I don't think it's possible. It may be possible that once in a blue moon a designer out there has a flash of insight and designs a fully-working, interesting system in a single day or week... but mostly mechanics require significant playtesting, revision, etc. Design just isn't that easy.<br/><br/>Now that doesn't mean you can't achieve a similar effect -- you do it by using existing mechanics, from other games, etc. But the idea of creating brand new, exciting mechanics every few weeks sounds like a pipe dream to me -- if you have a group that can do that, I hope you're publishing and designing games too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233245/#Comment_233245" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-20T02:26:32+00:00" title="September 20, 2009  2:26AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Playstorming FTW.<br/><br/>That is, you can do it by inventing the new rules set as you go along. Every session you start with a blank slate, rules wise, import some stuff from the last session and with the focus of this week's session in mind, add new rules and change them as you go along.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Also, I don't agree with Daniel, above. You can definitely come to the table with new, functional rules every time if you have a meta-system that guarantees them to be functional. This meta-system won't be that easy to design, but it's certainly possible. I suggest using Don't Rest Your Head as the base. You can do almost anything by having a bunch of dice pools that affect each other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233277/#Comment_233277" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-20T09:19:09+00:00" title="September 20, 2009  9:19AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I fail to see how rules are only meaningful if they are changing. <br/><br/>Furthermore your idea of a meta system of rules to keep the rules, rulelike is essentailly just hiding the baseline rules. It looks like your bringing in new and exciting rule systems every week, but really they are only premutations of the metasystem. Without the metasystem your throwing the baby (of good a good baseline in various areas) out with the bathwater (of old rules) with the metasystem your merely hiding the baby (the metarules will have rules presumably to keep the new rules int he baseline and balanced with their previous incarnations) under the bathwater. <br/><br/>What it seems like your suggesting is that you like subsystems, and really power to you. Sometimes you just need rules that apply to certain people or whatnot. But I don't think you can easily port the idea of subsystems into a system like space (your own concept of metasystem is essentially saying you need a system before you can have a subsystem ) . <br/><br/>and i'm still not getting the meaningful comments, so rather than harping, how about you explain please. <br/><br/>L                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
