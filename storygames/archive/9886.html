My sense is that CC is only useful if you want to encourage people to adapt and publish their own materials based on your work, like John does with Danger Patrol and Lady Blackbird, for example. Is this a game you're assuming other folks will want to release supplemental material for?  If not, I wouldn't really bother with CC, because it doesn't do much for you.  People can freely play your game without needing to have the rights to it.<br/><br/>Why donations? Is this something that you're willing to give away free? My sense of "donation"-based products is that it often signals that a creator either doesn't want to go to the trouble of selling the product or is worried that it might not actually be worth money (because it hasn't been playtested extensively, for example). If it's the former, then sure, donations can be easier to deal with than sales, but you're less likely to make much return.  If it's the latter, then maybe you shouldn't be asking for money for it at all, y'know?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220087/#Comment_220087" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-22T09:17:46+00:00" title="July 22, 2009  9:17AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just one point about Donationware--the motivations for doing so are far from binary, as you seem to suggest. Off the top of my head:<br/>* Developed for some other remuneration or use, now fulfilled, and so why not give it away? Exs) A program that was done for a CompSci class; LARP rules for a single, paid event which can be abstracted for other events.<br/>* Charitability: it was fun to make, it works great, it makes people's lives better, so the maker wants it available to all, though wouldn't be adverse to thanks in the form of financial compensation. (Note, I've also seen Donationware setup as trades--we do it in our industry, trading ad space in publications.)<br/>* And the aforementioned effect to keep it from being perceived as "free and therefore toxic junk." It says, "look, this is free but it's worth something--$5 or you tell me."<br/><br/>I'll note that NPR runs as "donationware." It's creative content that is free and worthwhile, but they don't demand you pay to hear it (i.e. it's not moved to XM Radio or iTunes or similar). [Yes, this is muddled a bit by once being largely taxpayer funded, which got a lot of its infrastructure off the ground... but not any more.]<br/><br/>Anyhow... you merely spoke of your sense (i.e. perception) of such products. I'm just giving Marcus another data point on which to base his eventual decision.<br/>---<br/>While we're on the subject, have you considered crippleware? It's annoying, but you could offer the game without some key chapter or without a large percentage of its (say) Skills or Powers or Classes or Races whatever reference component your game needs (NOT procedural elements--you want it to be playable but incomplete, content-wise). And just say something like, "For the full list Skill and Powers, five additional Races and Classes, and a set of Alternative and Optional Rules, send $5 by PayPal to ...."<br/><br/>The game is playable, they get the goodness from it, but if they want to fully engage the setting, they have to shell out. Might not work for your particular game design, though. Some games have very little reference material (especially here at SG) and, thus, can't be "crippled."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220183">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220183/#Comment_220183" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-22T14:20:02+00:00" title="July 22, 2009  2:20PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Along these lines, I'm considering a "tip jar" on my blog.

My sense is that CC is only useful if you want to encourage people to adapt and publish their own materials based on your work, like John does with Danger Patrol and Lady Blackbird, for example. Is this a game you're assuming other folks will want to release supplemental material for? If not, I wouldn't really bother with CC, because it doesn't do much for you. People can freely play your game without needing to have the rights to it.<br/><br/>Why donations? Is this something that you're willing to give away free? My sense of "donation"-based products is that it often signals that a creator either doesn't want to go to the trouble of selling the product or is worried that it might not actually be worth money (because it hasn't been playtested extensively, for example). If it's the former, then sure, donations can be easier to deal with than sales, but you're less likely to make much return. If it's the latter, then maybe you shouldn't be asking for money for it at all, y'know?</blockquote>\nI'm going CC because its a very small book that will be best suited to PDF publishing. PDF is notoriously easy to copy and distribute, so I thought why not just let people do it anyway and place an advert in the back for another game I've designed and instructions on how to donate money for the PDF if they're that way inclined. <br/><br/>I think the game is absolutely worth paying money for, trying to persuade someone to hand over money for what amounts to about 15 pocked sizes pages might be beyond my skills as a salesman. Giving it away for free and letting other people pay what they want, might not be, however.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
