As a placement firm..."!<br/>Now I just need to understand how to play!  Or rather, how to game master Minions, Inc.<br/><br/><br/>I'm sure I could muster up notions of a "how-to" on my own... Cobble the plan to present this neat idea to my pals this weekend (as a fillin0fun-game for Saturday).  But I'd like to get a clear idea of the play-through of turns and actions and generally  WHAT  do you do as player characters?  How does the GM set up the game?  What's the plot?  Are there "encounters"?  What are examples?  How about any "actual play" examples to read?  Or (if there are no APs)  how about a quick example of what play MIGHT consist of.  From sitting down to explain this neat little idea of a game to my pals,  through all the game prep steps.  (Does the GROUP make the "Employer"?  Or does the GM do it prior?  Are the bullet points meant to be chosen or rolled randomly?,  etc...)<br/><br/>Then (assuming players take the basics of one of the various Minion options for their PC to build a Minion)  how does the game begin, continue, and end?  Do they "encounter" the Employer?  (Is the "Employer" the same things as the villain?).  Do they challenge/fight/ or order around the "Grunts"?   Do they get a mission (how would that work?)?  Do they challenge/fight their Employer?  Do they challenge/fight their Employer's Adversary and/or the Adversary's own minions (likely called sidekicks, pets, family or friends - not to be derogatory or inflaming on the "good guys" side right?)...<br/><br/>Generally...<br/>WHAT HAPPENS when playing this game??  <br/>And do you have any suggestions for creating a game plan?  (or ideas for a game plan to give as examples)<br/><br/><br/>As I mentioned... I could build the idea based on what I know and read... but there's really not a specific  "GM's Guide"  on how to make adventures or what to do in Minions, Inc. as written that I've seen.  So before going off assuming... I'd like to know what others think or have done or intended.<br/><br/><br/>Thanks!<br/>-kev-                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/philaros" title="philaros"><img alt="philaros" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/320/nZLZ1C0PEQG5H.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/philaros">philaros</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306493/#Comment_306493" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-31T16:58:53+00:00" title="December 31, 2010  4:58PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kev, I can't tell from your post whether you've read Apocalypse World, so it may be stating the obvious, but that's the first place for you to start.

I suspected that the case.<br/>But I'm just not interested in Apocalypse World at all,  so I'm not interested in buying the PDF for $15 just to read more about how to GM the game rules.  I did the due diligence and read info and reviews for AW.  Just not interested at all, or else I would go get it.  I'm all for supporting neat games, but I need a little interest to spend more than $5 on a game.<br/><br/>I'd appreciate hearing any breakdowns of how to GM and player Apocalypse World (and thereby Minions, Inc.)  for those that know/read or have played AW.  I'm not looking for specific breakdowns of the AW game... Only how the rules are intended to be used to set up story/adventures for the GM and how the players interact and play with the rules.<br/><br/>Thanks again.<br/>-kev-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306535/#Comment_306535" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-01T12:11:44+00:00" title="January  1, 2011 12:11PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really hate to say it but you really should go and pick up AW.

I am fully behind supporting small press games.  For example, I just bought the most excellent little game  "How to Host a Dungeon"  from reviews and threads I've read here.  If it's of interest to me  and  within my budget (for what I'm looking for and getting)  I'm happy to support and buy the product.<br/><br/>I'm not interested in AW.  Just ideas on how the Minions, Inc. hack might be GMed and played.<br/><br/>No offense to AW or the creators.  If/when I become fully employed again with extra money, I'll likely snatch it up.<br/>For now I'm only curious about how folks envision GMing and playing with the rules and such presented in Minions, Inc.<br/><br/>thanks<br/>-kev-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306562/#Comment_306562" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-01T23:05:51+00:00" title="January  1, 2011 11:05PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can't, it's basically a module.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306566/#Comment_306566" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-02T01:47:36+00:00" title="January  2, 2011  1:47AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: kevperrine</cite>Since I've not read/seen AW,  if it has ideas on how to GM or play style ideas - I'd love folks to give me ideas ... not direct text info.</blockquote>\nApocalypse World has a set of Agendas (3).<br/>From those Agendas there spring a bunch of Principles (between 10-18 or so).<br/>Those Principles lead you to a bunch of MC Moves, which you use to explore the Stakes for your Fronts (MC Created).<br/>Stakes are open-ended questions, often with Countdown Clocks associated with them.<br/><br/>But if you've researched Apocalypse World, you probably already know all of that.

There are some new rules and tweaks as to how things work, but fundamentally it is just Apocalypse World.  <br/><br/>Kevin:  For copyright reasons I could not just cut and paste pages 108 - 150 of the Apocalypse World book, but you should assume that they are actually a part of the Minions, Inc. rules.  Those pages include the chapters:  Master of Ceremonies, The 1st Session, and Fronts.  <br/><br/>To answer your broader questions, I will try to give you my perspective as to how I intended the game to be played.<br/><br/><b>Game Setup</b><br/>1) Have the players choose their playbooks, but don't have them make their characters yet.<br/>2) As a group go through the Employer Creation steps together.  All of the choices about the employer are made by the players, rather than by the MC solely.  Basically, this is the process that will create the setup for your game.<br/>3) Once the employer has been built, the players can now create their characters and the MC can flesh out the Employer, his specific goals, and what he needs them to do.  You may find that a lot of this process has already been done just through the natural brainstorming that comes from making an employer.<br/><br/><b>Playing the Game</b><br/>There is a lot of flexibility in how this part goes and it is all going to be dependent on your Employer and your group's style.  Here are some styles of play:<br/>\u2022 Day in the Life - What is daily life like in the lair?  Think Venture Bros with 21 &amp; 24 as the Main Characters<br/>\u2022 Minion Impossible - The Henchmen take on a more "elite" role and are sent out to do missions for the employer.<br/>\u2022 Employer Directed - The Employer goes out to do things and drags his minions along and then sends them to do things as necessary (typically by screaming things like, "Kill him!", "Defend me!", or "Bring me the girl!"<br/>\u2022 Employer Management - The Employer is an idiot and needs his Minions to keep him alive (so they stay employed) or he is competent and deadly and they need to secretly thwart him (so they can stay employed and not dead)<br/>\u2022 Some combination of all of these<br/><br/>One of the big decisions here though is tone.  Is the Employer silly and cartoony (the Monarch - Venture Bros., Dr. Drakken - Kim Possible), or is he deadly and menacing (Apocalypse - DC, Any Bond Villain, Kingpin - Marvel, etc ...) <br/><br/>Remember:  Vincent says it best.  Your agenda as the MC is:<br/>\u2022 Make Minions, Inc. seem real.<br/>\u2022 Make the players\u2019 characters\u2019 lives not boring.<br/>\u2022 Play to find out what happens.<br/><br/>From my point of view the Minions main goal (probably) is to not die <br/>\u2022 Don't get killed on the job<br/>\u2022 Don't get in the hero's way if you can avoid it (they can't)<br/>\u2022 Don't piss off your employer so he doesn't try to kill them.<br/><br/>Play the game.  Have fun with it.  If it doesn't make sense, ignore it (and then tell me about it.)  <br/><br/>I hope that this helps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine" title="kevperrine"><img alt="kevperrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine">kevperrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306835/#Comment_306835" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-04T17:13:38+00:00" title="January  4, 2011  5:13PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brandon A</cite><br/>I hope that this helps.</blockquote>\n<br/><br/>So, so much more than anything else in this thread. <br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>-kev-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
