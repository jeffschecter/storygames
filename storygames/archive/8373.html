You might also say science is what influences and ultimately resolves the situation, but I'm not sure if that's necessary. No lasers and (usually no) spaceships.<br/><br/>I just recently posted an article about Greg Egan, who I pretty much consider the best starting point to this Speculative Fiction corner of SF.

It covers all flavors of sci-fi, fantasy, horror, and everything else that blends them (or even with some more mainstream genre). Can't decide whether to call Alien horror or sci-fi? Speculative fiction. Debating about whether Star Wars is fantasy or sci-fi? Speculative fiction.  Tired of trying to define your fiction interests as sci-fi, with some fantasy, and oh I like horror too? Forget it, just say you're into speculative fiction.<br/><br/>So, as much as Heinlein protested that speculative fiction did not include fantasy or anything else that violated science, speculative fiction today has come to mean all forms of the unreal genres that normally get lumped into the same sections of the bookstore with slashes and dashes to separate the genre names.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185155/#Comment_185155" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-29T10:12:52+00:00" title="December 29, 2008 10:12AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 29, 2008 10:15AM by Andy.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, my friend Beth, who is more deeply involved in SF than any of you will ever be (seconded only by her husband, who is like that <i>Times Two</i>; and whose opinion/advice I'm currently querying on the matter), her definition is as follows:<br/><br/>"<b><i>My own feeling is that it's a blanket term invented so that people don't have to precisely define the boundary between 'science fiction' and 'fantasy'.  There have been a lot of religious wars about that line, so 'speculative fiction' is a peacekeeper.</i></b>"<br/><br/>That's pretty definitive in my book. It also explains why the term was created, to basically stop a lot of folks with time on their hands to shaddup about "Hyperion is Science Fiction" "No, Hyperion is clearly Fantasy!" "No, Hyperion is <i>Science Fantasy</i>" and so on. Looks like in that world, they too had the <i>"...But is it Really an RPG?</i>" debates as well, and far more intense than ours, since everyone is generally learned and Knows That They Are Right.<br/><br/>So even I was wrong. What I was attributing to Greg Egan is simply "Science Fiction: Hard Science/Transhumanism". Not that that means that it's any better than other science fiction (except for his Axiomatic and Diaspora, <i>which is in fact better than other science fiction</i>)... some of it is downright clunky or uninteresting (Egan's Incandescence, Binford's Eater are both transhumanist, hard... and boring as hell).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185156/#Comment_185156" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-29T10:16:26+00:00" title="December 29, 2008 10:16AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you everyone for your responses.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185219/#Comment_185219" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-29T14:50:15+00:00" title="December 29, 2008  2:50PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 29, 2008 2:51PM by Marshall Burns.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Logos, read the anthology <i>Dangerous Visions</i>, edited by Harlan Ellison.

To be that, the speculation needs to be central. Not necessarily the meat of the story, but the story pivots around it. The speculation has to be something truly speculative.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>"What if two teenagers from rival families fell in love?"<br/>\n  "What if a shark started eating people near a small resort town?"<br/>\n  "What if a talking cat barged in on a couple of latch-key kids and started tearing shit up, much to the consternation of their goldfish?"</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>The first one doesn't qualify because it's something that just happens in the world. The second, also, even if it's ridiculously exaggerated. The third, maybe. That's something that we have to speculate about because it's not something that happens.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure if fiction in which normal things happen in an extraordinary environment <em>doesn't count</em> or <em>I just don't like it</em>. But, if you can give one of those stereotypical movie pitches ("... picture <em>Friends</em> ... in <em>space!</em>"), then it certainly doesn't seem very <em>interesting</em>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
