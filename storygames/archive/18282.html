We're organizing a KristaCon event in NYC, at the same space as Burning Apocalypse Con (Studio 440), from May 24th - 26th. It'll have six games, three of Marvel Heroic, one each of DW, AW, and Monsterhearts. Each game will have 12-16 players, 3-4 GMs, and 3 sessions connecting to each other, forming a kind of miniature campaign. KristaCon is meant to provide a level of character growth and depth that you don't normally get in one-shot con games, and that's exactly what we're aiming for.<br/><br/>This'll be the first time that we've run the *W games in this format, and we're all pretty excited!<br/><br/>We'll be putting up a Kickstarter soon so people can get tickets in advance (and we're going to be throwing a few other goodies in there, too). We're looking for players, of course, but we're also looking for anyone interested in helping out as a GM. GMs will get lowered costs, along with endless admiration and adulation. Huzzah!<br/><br/>If anyone has any questions or is interested, let us know! Hope we'll see a bunch of you at the end of May!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kaser" title="kaser"><img alt="kaser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/686/nMCJHMAE3CEJS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kaser">kaser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414128/#Comment_414128" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-15T13:01:19+00:00" title="May 15, 2013  1:01PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Following up with the Kickstarter link mentioned above:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/marktruman/kristacon-nyc-may-2013" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/marktruman/kristacon-nyc-may-2013</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
