We can do this as actual communication from author to reader, rather than through some system that's eventually going to have a breakdown (not to mention the sort of arguments posited by Frank Miller about how putting ratings on your books is evil and stupid in the long run as it makes you submissive to the ratings board and stuff or something).<br/><br/>I also don't think that this sort of thing ought to be required of an author/designer. It's up to, y'know, <i>parents</i> to keep inappropriate material out of their children's hands, so the whole argument of "kids might get a hold of this, THINK OF THE CHILDREN" holds no water for me (seriously, I knew plenty of kids in elementary school who had porno mags. Ratings and minimum ages for purchase don't work for that purpose). But I do think that it can be <i>polite</i> to use ratings.<br/><br/>For instance, <i>Poison'd</i> says "For adults, please," on the cover, and as soon as you crack it open you find out why. That works for me.<br/><br/>I can talk about one of mine, the in-development <i>MADCorp</i>. I'm gonna be stamping on the cover, <b>RATED 'M' FOR "MOTHER" (as in "may offend your")</b>, as well as a disclaimer inside the cover. That rating is both a joke and an honest assessment of the game's content. It has repeated references to drug abuse, murder, criminal insanity, cannibalism, and dead-end jobs, all treated with a tone of gleeful "fuck you" abandon with plenty of profanity. It includes sentences like, "If you spike your hair with the blood of the innocent, you get +1 to your dark powers" and "Yes, kids, drugs <i>are</i> the answer." I don't even want to show it to <i>my</i> mother.<br/><br/>So, yeah. Any other thoughts on this?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252198">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252198/#Comment_252198" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-23T08:45:03+00:00" title="January 23, 2010  8:45AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds good to me, especially that communication part. Of course, all but the weakest works already communicate plenty, it's just that often that communication requires specialized media literacy skills to interpret. We often see this with anime nowadays, and in earlier decades similar situations happened with fantasy genres - just imagine being familiar with sword &amp; sorcery tropes only from <i>He-Man and the Masters of the Universe</i>, and then encountering some of the seedier original pulp. A fantasy fan has no problem recognizing whether a given work is supposed to be grim or heroic, but that's not nearly so obvious to a less genre literate audience, which might cause surprises both good and bad.<br/><br/>The only time I remember having done ratings is when I warned about <i>Bacchanal</i> in our webstore that playing it with minors would probably be inappropriate and likely illegal under Finnish law due to the things you do as part of the game. There was also the time when I put an age recommendation on <i>Zombie Cinema</i>, but that was just a boardgame-like indication of the game's complexity, not a content rating. Aside from those I haven't done any explicit ratings in my rpg projects that I'd remember.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_252201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252201/#Comment_252201" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-23T08:52:21+00:00" title="January 23, 2010  8:52AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 23, 2010 8:52AM by Graham.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For Poison'd, I think it's great. That game is so nasty that I wouldn't want kids picking it up, thinking it was a cool pirate game.<br/><br/>But I wouldn't want warnings to be the standard. For example, A Taste For Murder is a murder mystery game, but it can get quite nasty, with talk of incest and unwanted pregnancies. Still, I wouldn't want an "Adults Only" warning on it, because that makes it sound as though it's full of blood and gore.<br/><br/>Another thing: different things offend different people. This morning, while sketching out ideas for Cthulhu Apocalypse, I considered having The Bible as an occult text. That's quite an offensive idea, to some people, but it doesn't involve sex and violence.<br/><br/>Really, I'd like the default to be: if you're picking up the game, you've an idea what you're getting into. After all, we don't put warnings on normal books: there aren't stickers on The Lord Of The Rings saying "Contains violence". I'd like that to be the presumption for games. That probably means that, generally, I'm against warnings.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252202/#Comment_252202" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-23T08:58:12+00:00" title="January 23, 2010  8:58AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, certainly, I think it's also important to not go <i>overboard</i> with ratings and warnings. If you were to put a warning on A Taste for Murder that implied it was full of violence and gore, then that would actually be a case of <i>mis</i>communication, in which case the rating is doing the opposite of what it's intended to do. And thus shouldn't be used.<br/><br/>(By the way, the idea of the Bible as an occult text is historically supported by real-life practitioners of Hoodoo, who quote passages as incantations, as well as using the Bible as a talisman for protection or other effects, by carrying it or leaving it open to certain pages at certain times of day and so on. So include it and blame it on other people.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_252203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252203/#Comment_252203" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-23T09:13:47+00:00" title="January 23, 2010  9:13AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also there is the fact that roleplaying games are largely made of self-created content. Thus we can't really comment on a product except for the flavour material and the things the rules make the players do. So if a game includes a full-blown erotic novel, then perhaps it is to be classified as erotica. Or if the game instructs the players as part of playing the game to develop erotic fiction, then likewise. But in between there's a quite big niche for games that do not include anything explicit or directly instruct you to do anything explicit, but still support such play. For this reason the great majority of quite adult games we play do not really need any warning labels. <i>Sorcerer</i>, one of the nastier games around, includes rather minimal amounts of dark material in the core book - everything nasty comes from the players, not the book.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252206/#Comment_252206" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-23T09:33:38+00:00" title="January 23, 2010  9:33AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I once released a game that carried the disclaimer 'Warning: Intended for mature audiences.

The amount of sex, debauchery, and sodomy that's gone on in my games of D&amp;D is pretty horrific when I think about it. <br/><br/>So, ratings for what's in the game's book are okay. Ratings for what you think the game might encourage are more difficult, but still probably doable. But in the end, what comes out of most games most of the time is going to be up to the players. So... egh. <br/><br/>Cause really, if you take Breaking the Ice you could end up with a G rated lightly romantic romp about middle school students, or you could end up with Superman sodomizing Batman in low orbit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_252219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252219/#Comment_252219" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-23T10:53:32+00:00" title="January 23, 2010 10:53AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's polite to do this, if there are things in the book that aren't immediately apparent from the covers and blurb; mostly to avoid disappointing people who bought it with the wrong expectations. For example, I once bought "Sundered Skies" to play with my kids, because it looked like a cool floating-islands-with-pirates game; but when my son read through the introduction the creepy demonic stuff freaked him out, so I returned it (fortunately the FLGS gave me full store credit.)<br/><br/>{OT: Actually the most confusing/misleading covers I've seen aren't on RPGs but on some indie comix. I think the combination of kids-comics art style with disturbing subject matter can be great (viz. Jim Woodring), but it can make it really unclear whether something's actually for kids or not. Tony Millionaire' stuff is a great example; I've seen it misfiled in the kids section at my local shop. James Kochalka's books are even more confusing because some of them <i>are</i> for kids and some are emphatically not, but you can't tell from the covers.}                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20C" title="David C"><img alt="David C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20C">David C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252285/#Comment_252285" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-23T22:00:56+00:00" title="January 23, 2010 10:00PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 23, 2010 11:59PM by David C.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a horrible, horrible,<br/><br/>HORRIBLE <br/><br/>horrible idea. <br/><br/>1.

By adding the wrist straps THEY BECAME LIABLE. By adding a rating system, you transfer the liability to you. <br/>2. Uninformed parents will begin thinking that (all) RPGs are dangerous to children.<br/>3. The easier you make something, the stupider people will act. <br/>  a. Imagine what would happen if  Panty Explosion was rated "E for everyone."  <br/>  b. A small town removed all their stop lights and replaced them with stop signs.

Just like video games, they will try and make it illegal to sell mature RPGs to minors.<br/>5. Everyone can agree on what's (considered) appropriate for Minors and Adults. Ratings try and break that into <i>debatable </i>categories. <br/><br/>No, it is far better to treat RPGs the same way books are treated. There are no ratings. Parents are expected to make <i>educated </i>decisions about books (and RPG games).  If you personally feel your book is for mature audiences, write down a sentence on the cover that says, "This book is intended for mature audiences only."

I think the labels on Polaris and Poison'd are just about right.<br/><br/>I know that if I ever get around to putting Horsies of Happiland into print, it <i>will</i> have a warning label of some kind.  Fuck, it might be shrink-wrapped, depending on how far I go with the art.  But that's especially touchy in my mind because it might otherwise appeal to children and it needs to be very clear that they are not the proper audience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252482/#Comment_252482" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-25T06:29:52+00:00" title="January 25, 2010  6:29AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>I wonder how many roleplaying games marked "Not suitable for children" or "Contains gore" are actually saying "This book is filled with<i>awesome shit!</i>".</blockquote>\nAll of them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
