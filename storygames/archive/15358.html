We\u2019ve got three issues out, and the fourth one is being done as I\u2019m writing this.<br/><br/>And it will be our final issue.<br/><br/>Anyone who\u2019s worked with a magazine will know what challenges it poses to keep things running, especially financially; and if you\u2019ve been involved in any project based on voluntary work, you know how hard it is to keep some of the key spots filled in. Sadly, we haven\u2019t been able to reach a critical mass of subscribers, and if we continue longer than this, we will, in essence, have to pay for the magazine out of our own pockets. (Which is, to some extent, happening already).<br/><br/>It\u2019s still possible, for a while, to buy back issues; you can even buy all four for the price of a one-year subscription. We\u2019ve taken down the subscription page, so people won\u2019t be misled \u2013 but just contact us at subscriptions@playgroundmagazine.net for more information.<br/><br/>We have tried to be fair in all our dealings, and will continue to try. If, after receiving <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a>, you feel you haven\u2019t received your money\u2019s worth, please let us know at contact@playgroundmagazine.net and we\u2019ll sort things out.<br/><br/>As I said, it\u2019s been an interesting year. I, personally, believe this magazine, or something like it, should exist. However, we \u2013 the current team of editors and designers \u2013 won\u2019t be the ones to make it happen. If you think you are, I hope you do make it happen! Let us know if there\u2019s anything you want to know from us, at contact@playgroundmagazine.net.<br/><br/>Yours,<br/><br/>Matthijs Holter<br/>Soon-to-be-ex-Chief Editor of Playground Magazine                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_348751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348751/#Comment_348751" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-12T03:22:29+00:00" title="November 12, 2011  3:22AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 12, 2011 3:25AM by Hans_c-o.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How much for the one-year subscription (all four issues?), shipped to the U.S.?

I have never done it. Most people have never done it. I imagine this is different in many other parts of the world, but I may be wrong.<br/><br/>Seriously, I think it's just: people in the U.S. don't buy things if they're shipping from overseas. I look back &amp; wish I had bought Playground, but I also look back and remember why: shipping from overseas? That's expensive &amp; weird &amp; conversion rates &amp; what? I know: super lazy.
