<p>So, published, stable games have been getting a lot of play on those online chat thingiees, but I've been observing myself and others (with the heartening exception of JBR's <em>Agora</em>) having difficulty assembling playtest games.</p>
<p>I'd like to do something about that.</p>
<p>So I am proposing a scheduled, periodic event where we trade off tests, on a system of exchange: if you do enough playtesting and feedback, then the group agrees to test a game for you; similarly, if the group tests  game, then you agree to participate in testing for others.</p>
<p>I'm thinking that you get like one "credit unit" for playing a standard role in a game, and two for taking the GM-prep-systems-guru role for someone else's game (like if I were to GM Legends of Lanasia). When your game gets run, it removes some of your credit units; the idea is that we want to hold everyone's credits as close to 0 as possible, indicating that they get a good balance of feed-out and feedback.</p>
<p>The idea here isn't to build some draconian bureaucracy of playtesting, and bully people with it, but rather, to help people schedule playtests and build design relationships with people; I know that some of us don't drop by the channel except to play, and maybe some of you would be more interested in pickup games if they were organized to actually occur, y'know?</p>
<p>So, does this sound, like, good? Would people participate? If so, then I will take up the responsibility of maintaining the calendar and roster at <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23indierpgs&amp;Mode=like">#indierpgs</a>. If someone else wants to take up a similar role with regards to the Foundry, then that would be awesome.</p>
<p><em>Naturally this structure has some drawbacks, some of which I've anticipated and some of which have been pointed out to me. The <strong>main point</strong> of the effort is to have playtests going on at a predictable time, in a predictable place, so that people who want to play new games and people that have new games to offer know where they can go and expect to pull together a game swiftly and easily.</em></p>

                            I am very interested, depending on scheduling.  I'm generally available after 6 on weekdays, except Tuesdays.                        </div>

                            If you set this up, I would be interested in the fall. Right now, I'm just too busy to do much of anything online. Great idea though.                        </div>

                            Hi!<br/>
  Count me in! I think this is a great idea. I almost suggested something like this earlier. But didn't think I had the pull to make it happen. I sure hope you do Shrey! There are a lot of very good designers around here who could use a hand getting their games off the ground. and I am more than willing to roll up my sleaves and lend a hand. And it would be nice to know that there was a group of people that I can count on to reciprocate!<br/>

                            I'm interested, though still too busy to do much gaming, even online.  Hopefully that'll change soon, though...                        </div>
