It's all very quickly put together, and I'm sure there are things I've missed, but I thought I'd put it out there to see if anyone else had the same kind of idea.<br/><br/>"Anything, Anywhere, Anytime" is an alternate setup for the Bulldogs RPG, by Brennan Taylor. It exists in the same universe as the Bulldogs setting, but assumes the Bulldogs are part of the Cold War machinations taking place through the Frontier Zone. The players all work for Bulldogs Inc, a very real space haulage company that is in fact a front company for the Saldrallan Intelligence Agency. The crew will be deniable assets on the front lines of the Cold War.<br/><br/>TransGalaxy is a Saldrallan Intelligence Agency (SIA) Front company that has grown to be one of the largest commercial freight companies in the galaxy over the past two hundred years. In the Cold War between the Salrdallans and the Templari, TransGalaxy has been able to blossom and thrive. Bulldogs Inc is a subsidiary of Frontier Corporation, itself a subsidiary of TransGalaxy , that specialises in supporting SIA covert operations within the Frontier Zone.<br/><br/>The unofficial slogan of Bulldogs Inc, "Anything, Anywhere, Anytime", sums up the attitude of its staff, and its starships regularly find themselves in such diverse roles as supporting Saldrallan covert operations in bush-fire wars throughout the Frontier Zone, transporting Saldrallan commandos, VIPs, refugees, arms and materiel, medical personnel, military trainers and drugs and supporting freedom-loving revolutionaries against their Templari proxy governments, or assisting pro-Saldrallan governments suppress Templari-supported rebels. <br/><br/>Of course, should the crew or the ship be captured by those forces loyal to or working on behalf of the Templari, the Agency will disavow any knowledge of your existence. Be careful out there.<br/><br/>The Ship - As per the normal rules.<br/><br/>The SIA Handler - The handler replaces the Captain.<br/>Concept: Your handler is a spook. An Agency asset that acts as the middle-man between the SIA and you. What kind of individual is he or she? A ruthless, driven bastard? A fanatical idealist who can see no wrong in the SIA or its activities? <br/>Trouble. How does the motivations of your handler affect you? Is he or she a high-flying agent who sees you as a stepping stone to a better job within the SIA? <br/>Leadership: How does your handler deal with you? <br/><br/>Character Creation - As per the normal rules with one exception.<br/>The Captain: One of you is going to have to be in charge. The one the buck stops with back at SIA HQ. The one the Agency is going to be looking for first if it all goes south.</blockquote>\nJohn                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
