Play answers the following questions:<br/>1.) Is it important to honour life after death?<br/>2.) Will we pay for the damages we wreak on the defenseless?<br/>3.) Where do we go next?<br/>4.) Can we take things with us when we go?<br/>5.) Can we take others' things with us when we go?<br/><br/>The game has to be four pages long, right? So each of the pages describes a player role. It can either be played with two players (each taking two roles) or four players (each taking one role). <br/><br/>The idea is there is A Graverobber, A Owner, A Victim, and A Waking.<br/><br/>The Graverobber goes into a grave, and finds something.<br/>The Owner (now deceased) describes the history of this thing, giving it weight and emotional worth.<br/>The Graverobber either takes it or moves on to something more valuable.<br/>                               If the Graverobber moved onto something more valuable, the Owner now describes the history of the new thing. Repeat until satisfied.<br/><br/>The Victim describes the impacts that this crime has on non-earthly existance. Does the ghost owner start bleeding and wailing and haunting? Does a man in another world suddenly lose the same item? What planar implications exist? This scene will help explain what happens when we die.<br/><br/>Next, the Graverobber wakes up. The Waking player describes where he wakes up, what he first sees, and what he feels. Maybe he wakes up the next day with feelings of guilt. Maybe he is actually waking up after his death, robbed of all his possessions. Maybe a ghost wakes him up, and they are on a mountaintop in the middle of a rainstorm. This can be as paranormal or real as the players want.<br/><br/>This is the full cycle. Close curtains.<br/>You can repeat for multiple rounds, but the idea is to play for very short periods in a very defined way.<br/><br/>The idea is to start with an action, and then extrapolate moral and spiritual and existential repercussions from that point forward. You find an item. The item means something to someone. Taking it has effects you don't understand. You awaken to something. End.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94235/#Comment_94235" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-09T14:44:41+00:00" title="September  9, 2007  2:44PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, I just playtested this once, with two people: me and Kirk Mitchell.<br/><br/>With two people, turn order goes: Graverobber (me), Owner (Kirk), Victim (me), Waking (Kirk).<br/>The interesting thing is that with two players, the Graverobber dictates the effects on the victim and the item's owner dictates the effects on the graverobber (through the Waking). It's a bit of an interesting reversal kind of thing. It definitely removes any element of assumed character ownership.<br/><br/>Right, so I'm going to do an overview of the Actual Play and then talk about pacing issues and the like.<br/><br/>Explaining the game went super quickly.<br/>Graverobber was played by me, with Owner played by Kirk. Victim was played by me, with Waking played by Kirk.<br/><br/>I'm just going to type out the script of play (not word for word, as I didn't record it) because the game is super short:<br/><br/>Graverobber: This is Robert's first grave robbery, and his heart is pounding. *hits chest repeatedly to give the impression of a pounding heart*. He's British, and it feels wrong to take from a British grave site... but luckily he doesn't have to. His grandmother was half British, half French, and she chose to be burried in a graveyard just outside of Paris. During her funeral, I noticed several other freshly filled beds. They didn't even have their tombstones yet, just rusty grave markers. I decided to go back that night and dig my way into one.<br/><br/>The dirt is almost black it's so dark. I finally get to the coffin and open it up. It's a young woman - 34, maybe? Too young to be dead. I run my fingers across a pair of pearl earings she has in. *stops, looks at Kirk expectantly*<br/><br/>Owner: I got those earrings given to me as a gift. *pauses* ...by my younger brother. *stops*<br/><br/>...me: is that it?<br/>...Kirk: Yeah. I don't really know what I'm going for here.<br/><b>ISSUE #1: There needs to be a really clear understanding of the motivations for the four different roles, and their purposes. In this case (Owner), it's moral provocation so that the Graverobber has to do a balancing act - do I take the item despite its significance? Do I discard it in favour of something else? What if the more expensive item also has more emotional weight?</b><br/><br/>Graverobber: I drop the earrings and keep looking. I find, around one of her ankles, a golden bracelet.<br/><br/>Owner: I got that bracelet for ten dollars. *chuckles* We found it in a Paris flea market, and the stall owner clearly thought it was a fake. My boyfriend bought it for me. Instead of putting it around my wrist - as any sensible dolt would do, he chased me all around the market, and when he caught me he took off my shoe and put it around my ankle. It didn't fit properly as an anklet, but I still wore it there because of him.<br/><br/>...me: Fuck! Now here's a key point about the game: I have no idea what happens to that memory if I take that bracelet. Does it go away? Do I get it? Is it freed? Furthermore, I'm not actually allowed to explore what happens to that memory in this course of this game.<br/>...Kirk: Yeah, I know.<br/>...me: And if I discard this item and pick something else up, what's to say the situation will be any better for me? Okay, fuck it, I'm going to take it.<br/><br/>Graverobber: I take the gold bracelet and run.<br/><br/>Next, I play the Victim, describing the implication of my actions to the dead victim.<br/><br/>Victim: Maria -for that is her name - is in a place that hasn't existed since she was nine. She's at the river, beside her farmhouse. This place was destroyed by industrial expansion... more smog; faster cars; bigger buildings. But for this moment, it exists. Except - she isn't nine anymore. She's twenty nine. Suddenly, as she's laying there, she feels dirt fall on her face. Dirt that's so dark it's almost black. It's falling from the sky, and from the trees and the clouds. It piles up everywhere, and from nowhere seemingly a hand reaches down and takes her golden bracelet from her ankle. Dirt keeps falling, and she closes her eyes. When she opens them, dirt has covered the stream and turned everything into mud and silt. It's all changed again.<br/><br/>Next, Kirk plays the Awakening of the Graverobber, describing him waking up to something.<br/><br/>Awakening: The next day - no, make it a week later, he wakes up. He makes his way downstairs and notices a note from his landlord. He's selling the house to a major construction company who'll be demolishing the house and building a new industrial park over top of the same ground.<br/><br/><b>Notes</b>:<br/><br/>In two player mode, there's a single turn order hiccup: after the Owner shares a memory, the Graverobber has to deliberate on whether to take the item or not. And then if they take it, they also play the Victim immediately afterwards... so it's almost like a turn and a half. I need to be explicit about the fact that the Graverobber's Approval is part of the Owner's turn.<br/><br/>I loved the way our Victim and Awakening worked together. They tied together beautifully.<br/><br/>I wonder what happened to the memory of the golden bracelet now that it has been stolen. I like that the game left me wondering something.<br/><br/>Biggest note of the session: Holy hell, this game is emotionally heavy. I have to choose to steal something from a dead person, but not before learning (as a player), the emotional and historical weight of that item. If it's a two player version, I also have to narrate the spiritual implications this has on the dead person on the other end. The Owner has to create memories that provoke difficult decisions on the person who's taking from them. The Awakening is effectively a judgement of a person without knowing anything about them except taht they have robbed a grave. This is all really intense shit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94529/#Comment_94529" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-10T20:49:43+00:00" title="September 10, 2007  8:49PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If anyone wants to provide any input, give any feedback, etc... that'd totally rock.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94534/#Comment_94534" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-10T21:08:00+00:00" title="September 10, 2007  9:08PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to focus on the first post rather than actual play.  My concerns:<br/><br/>- Too much interaction between two roles early on in the game, with the Victim and the Waking twiddling their thumbs.  <br/><br/>- And in general, there seems to be less interactivity than I'd want, as far as what the system enforces.  At times, this reads like a table where two people have a conversation, and then the two others do some monologuing.  And even those two conversationalists are occasionally monologuing.<br/><br/>- The cure for both of these concerns, the way I think about it: I kind of want every role that's not a primary participant in each stage to have some "secondary powers" they can exercise.  Keep everyone at the table engaged at all times.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94539/#Comment_94539" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-10T21:20:17+00:00" title="September 10, 2007  9:20PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Fred.<br/><br/>I see a similar issue to the one you see, I think.<br/><br/>The fact that each player has their vignette they share, with some limited interaction between the bits... that's intentional. It's supposed to be a storytelling exercise where each person has their moment where it's all on them.<br/><br/>The issue I have though is that the first two roles are very conversational and interdependant, and the next two are completely isolated. I'd like it if each role fed into the next, and there was an element of conversation amongst all the roles.<br/><br/>I also feel that the Victim stage has very little to play off of... and needs some really focused guidelines and keys.<br/><br/>I think those two things (not conversational enough, Victim needing more supports) could probably be addressed together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
