Character creation went fine and I'm really looking forward to actually beginning the game. Now, unfortunately I have to admit that I'm not really getting the way harm is dealt in normal, non-extended conflicts. Here is my actual understanding of harm:<br/><br/>1. Harm could be part of the Stakes of an ability-check. The Story Guide might decide to declare that failing an ability-check will cause some harm. This, however, is totally up to the Story Guide. There is no mechanical necessity.<br/><br/>2. In extended conflicts, Harm is part of the mechanic. That is, if you proceed with an extended conflict a participant will receive harm if the opponent is successful with a harm-check.<br/><br/>Now my question is, what happens in a normal conflict? Is it open to the Story Guide? Or can the player declare that she wants to cause harm? Or do I have to switch to an extended conflict if I want to cause harm?<br/><br/>I would greatly appreciate your help. Thanks in advance.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374294/#Comment_374294" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-25T04:44:01+00:00" title="April 25, 2012  4:44AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 25, 2012 4:46AM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, always nice to hear that somebody's playing with the <i>World of Near</i> book. It's relatively rare, perhaps because the book is in hindsight not the easiest to understand. I hope you'll have fun, and be sure to ask if anything in the book confuses you.<br/><br/>The answer to your question is simple: in normal conflicts the presence of Harm in the stakes is estimated by the Story Guide. A player might wish for and ask for Harm, and he should get it, but the degree depends on the SG: if it's a fistfight, you might declare that the loser will take a 3rd level Harm, for example. The <i>Solar system</i> text phrases this in a very technical but potentially misleading manner: what happens exactly is that the Story Guide looks at what is happening in the fiction, and then declares Harm accordingly, <i>after which</i> one or more players might declare conflict to avoid this consequence of the events.<br/><br/>What the above technically means is that the order of is like this:<ol><li>The players and SG set up a situation in free play. A fistfight, for example. A player narrates how a given character hits another one with a powerful uppercut.</li><li>The Story Guide's grey matter starts whirring and he opens his mouth: "This is a brutal fight, you're going to take Harm 3 before he beats you down" he might tell to one of the players involved. He's probably giving out some Harm to everybody involved, or whatever. His call, all according to the sensibilities. In some genres a fistfight is serious business just like in real life, in others it's basically how you say hello to a long lost friend.</li><li>The players involved decide whether the fictional and mechanical events warrant a conflict. They might be happy with just some simple Ability checks (as described in chapter 4), or they might want to avoid that Harm by winning a conflict over it. If they go for the latter, then the ordinary conflict procedure starts. The SG probably retains that Harm thing as part of the stakes: the loser takes Harm 3 or whatever.</li><li>After the simple conflict is done, the Harm is distributed according to the results. However, if one of the participating players decides to extend the conflict, the Harm never comes - the extension overrides the consequences of the simple conflict.</li></ol>\nWhat the above somewhat technical procedure boils down to is simple: the Story Guide decides how much Harm to throw around, but the players have the choice of demanding conflicts to avoid the Harm. The Story Guide makes his decisions on an organic, natural basis: Harm in this kind of use is a natural outgrowth of the fictional position into the mechanics of the game. Don't hesitate to use it, don't hesitate to set it as you see it, don't try to balance it against some perceived strength of the player characters: Harm 6 for injuries that break a man, Harm 1 for showy and superficial wounds, trust the system to handle the mechanical consequences appropriately.<br/><br/>Note that the above makes Harm befave exactly the same way as a fictional consequence: declaring that a character falls into a well happens by the same exact procedure as declaring that a character suffers Harm. In this regard Harm is truly a mechanical conjunct of the fiction.<br/><br/>In practice remembering to set Harm consistently is one of my own personal weak points as the Story Guide, as it's pretty easy to just go with the flow of the game. I've gotten better at it via practice, though. The benefit of remembering to do this consistently as opportunity affords is that it quickens the mechanical cycles of the game and creates attrition. It also brings the fiction and the mechanics closer together; Solar System is a game in tension between formalist and organic principles, and many of the organic impacts are up to the Story Guide to introduce into the otherwise relatively clinical mechanical landscape.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jan" title="Jan"><img alt="Jan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://api.ning.com/files/aMCvJWa*119KpxWfJKRX3wq*4TaoGdbPDFLD2u-xwv3UxkjerE6mt2*bPXjTPEakxlyfWEOhLHh83PvGpr4dR0WqgIT-CrY4/madmansig.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;crop=1%3A1"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jan">Jan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374320/#Comment_374320" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-25T10:14:54+00:00" title="April 25, 2012 10:14AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is an excellent answer - now it's crystal clear (or so hope, anyway; actually using it will show).

If not, why not?</blockquote>\nIt does not shake out before the next extended conflict ends, except of course if some Secret or other exception causes such.<br/><br/>The reason is that Harm is relatively difficult to gain, and characters are robust. If Harm shaked down trivially, then characters would practically never enter an extended conflict with upper level Harm already present. Also, it causes some minor exploits if you can shake down Harm easily: for example, you could use some of the healing methods (natural healing or an Ability check, say) to heal a low-level Harm, then shake down to effectively remove the highest-level Harm you have. High-level Harm is basically the only sticky debit characters have in Solar System, so there's no good reason to make it less awful than it is.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the reason for why Harm shakes down after an extended conflict is basically that you've probably suffered more than enough Harm by entering it in the first place. It encourages giving up early, before your low-level Harm levels get filled up. If the opponent opens the first round with Harm 5, you know that it's a good time to give up while you still can get it down to Harm 1 without major expense. It could be seen as part of the game's player-rights balancing package in that it's impossible for your character to get permanently debilitated by a high-level Harm <em>unless </em> you yourself allow multiple levels of Harm to pile up through the conflict. One might say that the equivalent safety feature in simple conflicts is the fact that the SG is only allowed to give you a single Harm stage off a single simple conflict. So it's single potentially high-level Harm in simple conflict vs. multiple Harms that are guaranteed to shake down in extended conflict. Different details, but the ultimate outcome is that characters can't be one-shotted easily by arbitrary mechanical forces barring a real Transcendent dice outcome (which in turn is difficult to achieve without legitimate fictional supremacy).<br/><br/>Ultimately I'd categorize the shakedown rules as relatively arbitrary method-wise; they can easily be fine-tuned if a group prefers something else, either increasing or decreasing shakedown. It probably won't sway the fundamental game experience much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
