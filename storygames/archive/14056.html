Dice roughs Gnarly up a bit, so his buddy, Shadow the Battlebabe, scares Dice off.\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, after some back and forth including a brain opening that reveals a threat from the water Hammer has brought back, Winkle the NPC holder puts Shadow on retainer to balance Hammer's savagery. He was right to. Right after the meeting, Hammer asks Shadow to kill Winkle. Winkle's boy Chack hears the deal, Hammer doesn't kill him in time, so Winkler knows. Hammer decides not to push it and flees across the waste. Winkle hires Shadow to bring him Hammer's head and gives him a gang to make it happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now, as MC, I'm thinking I didn't do very well. Not very many named NPCs, not very many threats, and they're moving on from Winkletown\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\nSo do I treat session two like a session one? Or do I make up some threats/fronts?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd how are these love letters?<br/>\n<br/>\nDear Hammer;<br/>\n<br/>\nTraveling the waste sucks. It's blistering hot, your bleeding water, and your bike's a guzzler--you won't make it far without a refuel.\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\nRoll +weird. On a 10+, your crew manages to get to the next hold strong enough to raid or hire out.<br/>\nOn a 7-9, choose 2:<br/>\nYour bikes still work.<br/>\nYou didn't ditch your weapons for weight.<br/>\nYou didn't get taken prisoner by the hold's gang.<br/>\nOn a miss, none of the above and I'll ask some questions about how it went down.\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\nXoxo,<br/>\nYour MC<br/>\n<br/>\nDear Shadow;<br/>\nWinkle hooked you up. You followed Hammer to a big settlement, bigger than Winkletown. Roll+cool.\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\nOn 10+, the holder's heard of you. Tell me two rumors she's heard.<br/>\n7-9, choose 2:<br/>\nThe holder's not threatened by you<br/>\nThe holder's security isn't threatened by you<br/>\nYou're not taken prisoner<br/>\nYour gang's not taken prisoner.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, people get around. You've screwed somebody here.\xa0<br/>\nOn a 10+ both. On a 7-9, choose one. On a miss, she's powerful and angry.<br/>\nShe's in a position of power- maybe armory head?<br/>\nShe's still carrying a torch for you.<br/>\nXoxo<br/>\nYour MC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you guys think?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman" title="Ross_Cowman"><img alt="Ross_Cowman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2VVx8Kc--zY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACZ8/3Pco6NeJ4Ng/photo.jpg?sz=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman">Ross_Cowman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318211/#Comment_318211" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-30T13:22:53+00:00" title="March 30, 2011  1:22PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Two things,<br/><br/>For first sessions you should start small. Remember we're just following around the characters for a day to see what they do. Start by picking a player and asking them some questions. Start small, and build on the answers, stuff like<br/><br/>"So hammer, who taught you how to ride?"<br/>"Who ran this gang before you?"<br/>"Oh yeah? What happened to him?"<br/>"Cool, where do you guys shack up at night?"<br/>"An abandoned mall? Cool, does anyone else live there?"<br/><br/>When they talk about someone, give them a name from the list, when they talk about the place, write it on a map.<br/><br/>Go around the circle doing this with each person and their Apocalypse World will come to life with a bunch of relationships they care about. <br/><br/>After you've done this start making moves, I like to start by putting them together 2 at a time with some NPCs, set up some triangles, announce future badness, but make sure it comes from them, their actions.<br/><br/>Thing two.<br/>i got to say I would be pretty bummed to have my Chopper lose his bikes and guns to a die roll at the beginning of a session. Don't take away the things that make the players cool. Especially in a love letter.  <br/><br/>The second letter is a sure way to have the Battlebabe looking to leave at the first opportunity. <br/><br/>The last letter is cool, I like how it creates a new relationship for the player. <br/><br/>I would take the first opportunity to slow things down a bit, and help the players create the world and some relationships to ground them in it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_318212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff" title="Michael Pfaff"><img alt="Michael Pfaff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff">Michael Pfaff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318212/#Comment_318212" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-30T13:49:31+00:00" title="March 30, 2011  1:49PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Parker D Hicks</cite>On a 7-9, choose 2:<br/>Your bikes still work.<br/>You didn't ditch your weapons for weight.<br/>You didn't get taken prisoner by the hold's gang.</blockquote>\nI would maybe reword these to give the player a choice: <br/><br/>Like, "You gotta ditch something for weight.

Moreover, I think that if you're concerned about not having enough named NPCs and not having followed the PCs around enough yet, love letters might get you even further away from those goals. It might be better to open with a lot of provocative questions, rather than provocative answers.<br/><br/>Stuff like:<br/>Hammer, are you leaving the holding for real?<br/>Are you planning to quit it cold turkey? What about Lynch? You're just going to abandon Lynch?<br/>...Who is Lynch, anyways? What's the deal with you and Lynch?<br/>So, if you're leaving, where ya gunna get your fuel from?<br/>How are you going to pay them?<br/>What about that debt that Jaguar owes them?<br/><br/>Forcing ugly situations on the PCs is only interesting if we know who they are, what they're fighting for, and what might be at stake.<br/>I'd personally hold off on the love letters, and get to know who you're writing to for a few more sessions, first.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman" title="Ross_Cowman"><img alt="Ross_Cowman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2VVx8Kc--zY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACZ8/3Pco6NeJ4Ng/photo.jpg?sz=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman">Ross_Cowman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318239/#Comment_318239" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-30T18:57:13+00:00" title="March 30, 2011  6:57PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 30, 2011 7:04PM by Ross_Cowman.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/stefold">@stefold</a><br/>yeah totally.
