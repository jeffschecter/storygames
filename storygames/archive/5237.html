This latest game is a deliberate effort to take the existing game system from past Marquee Press publications and bend it toward more story-driven play. As the title suggests, this is a mystery roleplaying game (which in and of itself is a subset of RPGs that I'm happy to see get more/better coverage). <br/><br/>I just downloaded a copy myself, though as a fan of the magic system and semi-diceless approach to NPCs taken by earlier Marquee Press games, I fear that I may be a bit biased (that Joe says he nipped the equipment rules in part from Simple 20 does nothing to help this). That said, I do think that we have a good candidates for the Free Game category of the Indie RPG  Awards in 2008.
