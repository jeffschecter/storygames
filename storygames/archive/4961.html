Stop me if you've heard this one before.<br/><br/>So, we play story games, right? And the idea with story games is to create stories, right? So, if everyone's supposed to collaborate to make a good story, why do we need "conflict resolution"? Where do these conflicts come from, in the first place? Are they conflicts between characters in the narrative? Well, in that case, why don't we just agree on whichever outcome is more interesting for the story? Or might they be conflicts between the participants? If so: where do these conflicts stem from? Weren't we supposed to be collaborating, right now?<br/><br/>Couldn't we just get rid of resolution rules altogether and, y'know, <i>agree</i> upon things?<br/><br/>/Kalle, who's got his own answers but would like to hear the ideas of others.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111324/#Comment_111324" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-03T10:50:33+00:00" title="December  3, 2007 10:50AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Calvino</cite>Couldn't we just get rid of resolution rules altogether and, y'know,<i>agree</i>upon things?</blockquote>\nOr have someone agree on them for us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Calvino" title="Calvino"><img alt="Calvino" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Calvino">Calvino</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111327/#Comment_111327" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-03T10:54:33+00:00" title="December  3, 2007 10:54AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Or have someone agree on them for us.</blockquote>\nWell, that wouldn't be very collaborative, would it?<br/><br/>/Kalle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111331">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111331/#Comment_111331" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-03T10:59:30+00:00" title="December  3, 2007 10:59AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You don't need to have conflict resolution; what you're doing without it, in the way you describe, is basically collaborative storytelling (or writing, depending on your medium). It can work well. Stephen King has done it with plenty of people, and many other writers, too.<br/><br/>Personally, I like to have a conflict resolution system to get me out of my comfort zone. Allow for some unexpected outcomes. Feel like there's suspense there. Fire up my energy levels and focus my creativity.<br/><br/>Like, in our Contenders game, when two PCs were fighting each other. I had much fun doing that not knowing who'd win. It made for story material either way, but it was nice to have some system there to play through, rather than us agreeing on the outcome.<br/><br/>But I also like collaborative writing.

There have been several times where the group I've played in has met this zen state of "we have story here, and let us consult the dice" -- not because we had a disagreement about what was cool or fair or whatever, but because we wanted at that moment outside, random, thoughtless input.  We collaborated and arrived together to use resolution at that moment, not found conflict and agreed to use resolution to handle it.  Does that make sense?<br/><br/>I see this attitude in my gaming more and more with games like Don't Rest Your Head, that give lots of information in the mechanics beyond success/failure at a task or goal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111336/#Comment_111336" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-03T11:11:12+00:00" title="December  3, 2007 11:11AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 3, 2007 11:12AM by Remi.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you absolutely can play with <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">no rules</span> conflict resolution system. <br/><br/>However, sometimes people disagree. Sometimes, in playing a character, you have desires that are contrary to another character's wishes, or, as a player you're resistant to seeing your character go down a certain path. That's where a conflict resolution system is helpful. Bringing fruitful outcomes at decision points.<br/><br/>Further, if someone burns resources to ensure an outcome, it says, "THIS IS IMPORTANT" in a very real way to the other players. It can heighten drama, as well as say something about the resolution.<br/><br/>For example, in Sign In Stranger, if you lose during a conflict (which can only happen after 5 investigation scenes), you can make another card pull by risking something. So, while you get another shot at success, you may end up destroying a valuable item, or being wounded, in the process. This makes the struggle really lively, and has a huge influence on the resolution narration.<br/><br/>I'm also going to second Christian's point on 'getting out of the comfort zone'. It's helpful to have an impartial, an unquestionable, outcome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111338/#Comment_111338" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-03T11:14:55+00:00" title="December  3, 2007 11:14AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It might also not be an issue of conflict with a Capital C.<br/><br/>You reach a fork in the story. there are three players, each who suggests something cool and different as what happens next.

I don't mean immersion.  When I'm GMing I play to have my NPCs villains and otherwise succeed.  When I'm playing a PC I play to have my guy succeed.<br/><br/>This to me is not the same as playing to "win."  Winning and Losing is a social construct among players.  I'm not trying to show off my skills.  I'm not trying to be the better player.  I'm playing my characters (NPC and otherwise) with committed emotional passion.<br/><br/>I'm concerned about consensus techniques leading to prioritization of STORY STRUCTURE, which is cool if that's what you like to do.  I don't.  I don't want to be thinking, "Well this is an appropriate time for the villain to lose" or "this scene should really be about the down turn of Joe's relationship with Mary."  I want the SYSTEM to reveal those things to me through play so I can stay focused on playing my character's passions and for those plot twist and turns to shock me when I botch a roll.  And believe me despite my commitment to character success I relish unexpected failure.  Because it's just that: unexpected.<br/><br/>This is why I love Sorcerer so much.

Since DRYH is in essence a game where the player will win every time if he's willing to risk enough, it allows is a way to consider *how* the victory is achieved -- at what cost -- since even winning can bring us closer to doom.  It's a level of pacing I rarely see outside of mechanics (though I am very open to experiences that challenge this assumption!) -- in Polaris, I embrace the roller coaster ride of doom, and in other games success tends to be the opposite of doom.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>You reach a fork in the story. there are three players, each who suggests something cool and different as what happens next.

People sometimes claim that roleplaying is a storytelling medium, but I think that's misleading. Roleplaying isn't simply about telling stories - it's about <i>creating</i> stories, through the actions of one's character, and at the same time, <i>experiencing</i> those same stories, through the eyes of the same character. Of course, that's still possible without resolution rules. But if one mistakes roleplaying for a simple medium for expressing narratives, like film or writing, it's easier to miss the contribution that resolution rules can make.<br/><br/>/Kalle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cydmab" title="cydmab"><img alt="cydmab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cydmab">cydmab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111351/#Comment_111351" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-03T11:38:27+00:00" title="December  3, 2007 11:38AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My answer would be that a story is helped if one person can push the agenda forward with all their heart and soul, and another person can push back with all their heart and soul.

Sometimes, other people just knock me out with their ideas!

If it does not, play does not proceed. Either you, as a group, agree to what is going on, or you don't. If you don't, play ceases. That sucks! Now, very often this "resolution" is just people talking, grabbing onto each other's ideas. But, it's still <i>assent</i>.

Without resolution the entire process of collaboration depends on human interaction between the participants, which is pretty dangerous territory. In my experience people ended up pulling their punches or stepping on toes, so I think that's another reason resolution is necessary even when people collaborate.

Sometimes the term "conflict resolution" refers to a particular procedure, where one step of the procedure is "negotiate stakes" and sometimes this step in the procedure is handled by consensus.<br/><br/>This particular approach muddles the difference between using formalized procedures/rules to resolve disputes and "total consensus." It just so happens I dislike this hybrid-approach (or at least, I disliked it when using it in PTA). I dislike it so much I am sympathetic to the notion that pure consensus might be better than hybrid mechanics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bankuei" title="bankuei"><img alt="bankuei" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bankuei">bankuei</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111543/#Comment_111543" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-04T08:12:40+00:00" title="December  4, 2007  8:12AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I recently posted a game idea called Warriors of a Small House, which is more or less designed as a set of cues and flags that freeform players can use without having to spend a lot of time disengaging from the fiction in order to collaborate.   Basically, there's always the option to NEVER engage in the conflict resolution system if everyone is on that zone of collaboration.  The hypothetical collaborative ideal of the game would have no disagreement- the primary engagement with the rules would simply be players signaling each other when a scene ought to end by saying "Bow".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cydmab" title="cydmab"><img alt="cydmab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cydmab">cydmab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111572/#Comment_111572" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-04T09:07:33+00:00" title="December  4, 2007  9:07AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've had scenes in Polaris run with no-disagreement. Either the conflict mechanics are never invoked, or they consist of quick single "but only if" followed by immediate "and that was how it happened"<br/><br/>However, while no-disagreement is possible, free-collaboration between any and all players in the middle of a scene is still forbidden (Mistaken and Heart can't give each other direct advice, they are supposed to work through the conflict system) [ you can still collaborate with the moons, or between scenes]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
