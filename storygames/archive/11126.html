Once they make a decision, they won't change mind no matters who tells them (but maybe family members / husbands may be able to persuade them, I'm not sure). And they tend to be at the center of the world, caring very little for other people's feelings or opinions. Yes, they're even worse than Italian girls in that aspect. I couldn't believe it when I realized it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course this is my point of view. These traits can be positive, especially when it comes to determination. Take all I said with a grain of salt. Also because vietnamese society may have considerably changed since the '60.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247032/#Comment_247032" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-16T06:00:35+00:00" title="December 16, 2009  6:00AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            8,040 Vietnamese war brides entered the United States between 1947 and 1975.

To be a bride in the 60's assumes that the person is in the 20's (say mid 20's in the mid 60's) so they were born in 1940. You say she is married to an American diplomate so they have to be from the south. Their early years were marked by Japanese occupation. That was brutal so she probably went hungry a lot. Still that is eary in life so she may not remember much of it. Still her parents would have struggled so the rigid control found in Asian family structure would have been that much greater. After the war the Vietminh war with the returning French would have scarred her youth and teen years but much of the fighting was up north. If she was of the ruling class she would be Catholic and Francophile. There was significant conflict between the Catholics and Buddhists. This along with the communist democratic split meant that she never knew peace. I wonder how many of her family were killed. She was likely educated so she went to Catholic school. That would have been with the nuns so add in more discipline and control. She married an American soldier so she is pretty open to the West. This traps her between two world - worlds that are at war. <br/><br/>Add all this together and you come up with a person who knows nothing is secure, who is both repelled by and attracted to power and control, who hopes for a better future but who likely doesn't believe it will really happen. Hope and dispair - all very post colonial.<br/><br/>The Vietnamese we encounter now come out of a totally different world. Here in the US they may be the children of Boat People or of folks who fled before 1975. Their parents had that war experience but they didn't. When I run into folks like this they are living the immigrant experience that happens here in the US. That would not be relevant to your character. As to Vietnamese being cocksure and arrogant - that's not been my experience but it would be ease to run someone as the Dragon Lady. That might even be the funnest way to go. The thing I have seen is a lot of guilt and shame. East Asian guilt is as strong as Catholic guilt, Jewish Guilt, or any other kind of guilt you happen to know.<br/><br/>Good luck with the character! Hope this helps.<br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247047/#Comment_247047" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-16T07:21:38+00:00" title="December 16, 2009  7:21AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh! I didn't read this close enough. She is a widdow living in the US. That adds a new depth. She might be a little older so the Japanese occupation would have had more impact. All the other stuff still counts.<br/><br/>She is living in the US so the immigrant experience does matter. It's the early to mid 60's so no matter where she is in the US likely more people don't know where Vietnam is or know anything about it. They think she is Chinese or maybe Japanese. This will get her mean looks from various people. We'd only nuked Japan twenty years before and really looked down on them. There was a lot of lingering hatred. Hatred of the Chinese was older and more broadly based out west. Here in the Mid West there just weren't many Asians. People will not look on this woman as American. She is a foreigner and will have a hard time being accepted. No mater what her class of education in Vietname - here in the US she will be treated like an idiot. I once knew a woman from Afghanistan who was an MD but in the US (in 1981) she worked in a kitchen. Her in-laws may blame her for her husband's death and embarrased about interracial children. Remember this is the era of civil rights which means people made pretty horrible racial slurs. <br/><br/>All thid adds up to even more insecurity for your character. She may be very quiet and careful. Brash arrogance seems less likely - you have to have a safe base to do that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247147/#Comment_247147" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-16T13:20:54+00:00" title="December 16, 2009  1:20PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, thanks, guys!

They are unanimous that "no one" ever goes back to vietnam to visit family because conditions there are so wretched and there's a good chance they might not make it back here.  Most of their earnings are sent back to family still in vietnam though that still leaves them with more funds then they know how to spend (relative to what they had there).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe one characteristic that I did find interesting was a seeming lack of job based self identity or false pride.  One of the men who work at the shop was an officer in the police force in vietnam (something like a captain I gather) who wound up on the wrong side of a political shake-up and was ousted (and on the run).  Now he's a pedicurist and seemingly completely unphased by the career change.  I have a hard time imagining an American police captain winding up a pedicurist and being similarly content.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_247185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus" title="The_Magus (Banned)"><img alt="The_Magus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus">The_Magus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247185/#Comment_247185" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-16T15:16:50+00:00" title="December 16, 2009  3:16PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Take a look at the Oliver Stone film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107096/" rel="nofollow">Heaven and Earth</a>.

Now, I am by no means recommending the book as a good read or anything, nor is the mother the main character, but part of being Vietnamese-American is definitely captured in that work. <br/>\n<br/>\nPoliteness and appearances are very important.  Affection is not often expressed in words or physical contact, but rather by doing things for the one you care about, especially cooking food for them.  Many Vietnamese women value wealth and material success in both romantic partners and for their children... being a doctor or lawyer or similar profession are what they would encourage their children to be.  As a quick example, I went to my college's Vietnamese Student Association... and out of 25 or so students there, I was the only one who had an American name and the only one who was not a pre-med or pre-law student!<br/>\n<br/>\nHope some of this helps! Let me know if there's anything else I can help with!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog" title="Z-Dog"><img alt="Z-Dog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog">Z-Dog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247953/#Comment_247953" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T21:48:53+00:00" title="December 21, 2009  9:48PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can attest to the well-dressed part. The middle and upper class Vietnamese I see in Garden Grove are the neatest, most well put together people. They often dress well and up, more so than causally dressed white people I see in our local ritzy malls. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe middle class white people look, at times, like they're trying hard not to look too good. Jeans, old T-Shirt. I'm hip. I'm young.<br/>\n<br/>\nVietnamese look dressed WELL, like: sit up and take me seriously (not to the nines like Sunday church wear, but, like for men, I always see collars, nice watch, slacks...even on weekends.

She threatens him affectionately with kitchen knives on a regular basis, and tells him that if he ever tries to leave her that she'll kill him in her sleep. He spent a fair amount of time with her family in a rural village in the south, and he said that this was pretty typical discourse for women of her family (telling their fishermen husbands that they'd break their legs if they didn't bring in a catch). This was the sort of village and the sort of family where big family gatherings involved all of the menfolk getting horrifically drunk and brawling. Sounds not entirely unlike certain rural relatives that I have, only not fishermen.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis village was in the south, for what it's worth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
