Alchemics can be acquired beyond, but the Empire is ruthless in its pursuit of those who practice and study it without their permission. Heroes that possess Alchemics require a degree of inner power for the body to endure the modification process.<br/><br/>Wu Wei Mathematics - some are born with a unique Chi mutation that gives them the ability to see and warp reality. The Tao Academy has, for centuries, enjoyed the unique privilege of teaching the disciplines that focus this power. These are known as Wu Wei Formulae. Few are born with this mutation and only the Academy understands it. Those who practice Wu Wei find their skills both in demand and feared. The Academy is regarded with equal parts awe and suspicion; theirs is a unique position.<br/><br/>Tian Code - Tian, the great ubiquitous computer network forged by the Celestials, yet yields many technological wonders. There are many who devote their lives to plumbing Tian\u2019s mysteries.<br/><br/><br/>Alchemics are essentially sci fi kungfu in the form of genetic modifications of a transhuman nature.<br/><br/>Wu Wei is magic intended to be based around the Eight Trigrams of the I Ching. Eight specific 'formulaue' that represent psionic style effects.<br/><br/>Tian is based on (but not actually as this isn't ancient china in space but something influenced by it) the celestial bureacracy through a technological legacy.<br/><br/>The problem I have is devising abilities for each category. Do I want to spend time creating a list of powers for each, that are unique (hopefully)? Or is there a better more concise way to do this? What do you think?\ufeff                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453945/#Comment_453945" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-18T10:37:30+00:00" title="June 18, 2016 10:37AM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You could gamify that entire part of the game design by leaving the appropriate parts up to the players. For example, the way <i>Ars Magica</i> does this is that there is a set of "guidelines" on how difficult/expensive different types of magical effects are, and then it's left to the play group to codify individual spells within this framework. Ideas considered functional are written down and promulgated over a campaign, and thus a kind of player-created set of abilities comes into being in the process of play.<br/><br/>Were I in your shoes, I'd do the <i>Shadows of Yesterday</i> thing and have every magical tradition work with a different mechanical logic internal to itself, so as to emphasize their differences; there is no particular profit to be had in an universal scheme. So perhaps one of those magic systems is relatively freeform, with guidelines for power expenditure vs. achieved effect, while another one has narrowly defined, yet powerful spell lists, and so on.<br/><br/>Ultimately you'll have to decide whether you want your game to have a "crunch landscape" for the players to interact with, or if it's more to your tastes to keep everything mechanically straightforward and streamlined. In the former case creating a detailed system of character build options is unavoidable, while in the latter it is entirely feasible to avoid it. <i>Heroquest</i> is an example of a game with a highly flavourful setting, with many complex magical systems, yet no appreciable power lists due to the way the game's system works.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453946/#Comment_453946" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-18T10:42:50+00:00" title="June 18, 2016 10:42AM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am not familiar with how SoY works.

The unique part, I think, is the consistent way in which the game attempts to give an interesting, varied feel to different magical traditions, while also encouraging mixing and matching between them: it's not like <i>Exalted</i>, in which all the splats do similar things with similar mechanics, or like <i>D&amp;D</i>, in which different classes are actually asymmetrical, but combining aspects of them is very inflexible or even outright impossible. TSoY achieves a combination of flavourful variety and flexibility of character-building basically by abandoning the conceit of careful build balance: TSoY characters of equal experience are in no way assumed to be equal in strength, which proves to be much less of an issue for the game than certain strains of traditional thought would predict.<br/><br/>As an example of what I mean, you might wish to check out these two magic systems from the game:<br/><br/><a href="http://solarwiki.janus-design.it/en/book/1st-movement-shorter-near#three-corner-magical-philosophy" rel="nofollow">Three-Corner magic</a> is TSoY's take on traditional wizard magic with spells and such; it's easily the most flexible and varied magic system in the game, but the way the mana expense scales for greater effects means that many effects that are easy for other magical systems can be prohibitively expensive for Three-Corner Magic. For example, an ordinary invisibility spell in Three-Corner magic works by swaying the senses of the observers, which means that being invisible in front of a large crowd can cost an absurd amount of magical power. Also, Three-Corner has very limited means of addressing any sort of spirit entities, although this may be more of a cultural limitation than limitation in the theory of the magic.<br/><br/><a href="http://solarwiki.janus-design.it/en/book/2nd-movement-matter-ammeni#zu-the-first-language" rel="nofollow">The language of Zu</a> is a much more casual magic system, intended to foster improvisation. It's much cheaper in terms of experience points than Three-Corner magic, but it is also much more limited in its effects; all Zu workings are basically either summoning, controlling or enhancing something, which of course does cover the vast majority of the things one might ever wish to achieve with magic, but it still lacks the conceptual framework for e.g. creating magic items and whatnot. What Zu does, however, it does very well, being cheap in both experience and magical capability. As the literal language of creation Zu also has a thematic mandate to be outright supreme in theological terms, which works with the game's rules system to enable a Zu master to put up meaningful resistance against characters much more experienced in other magical systems.<br/><br/>As you can see, my first example magic system from TSoY goes the route of explicit power lists and complex combinatorics: a Three-Corner magician can learn magical skills, the scope of which is modified by magical secrets, which in turn can be combined into specific spells to control the sheer amount of magical power that the ever-more complex magical working needs. The system is still less hide-bound than many in that the players are expected to compose their spells themselves, developing their own standards for precisely what magical secrets are needed for what purposes.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Zu language works entirely differently: there are not lists of different powers, but instead there are only three powers, and each of them are accessible to all practitioners. Characters can possess different magic words that determine how extensive and flexible their application of the magic is, but those are just a list of words; any dictionary suffices, so there is no need for a list of powers.<br/><br/>Also, you can probably see with a little examination that there is no way in hell that any of this is in any way balanced to the degree that one would expect in e.g. D&amp;D or Exalted - it's more like Ars Magica, which also shares the ideal that character powers should be colorful and setting-appropriate rather than simply carefully combat-balanced. Three-Corner and Zu are very different, and they operate at different scales of time and space and activity; there is no meaningful way to say which one is better, expect to say that both have their strengths and weaknesses, and it will require actual play to put them to a test and see what the players make of them.<br/><br/>The reason why I recommend something similar for you is that just like TSoY, your setting also seems to feature culturally colorful magic systems (or "character heroism platforms", whatever one might call a set of special powers) that do not relate to each other in any particular way. I also get the sense that you're leaning towards allowing multi-classing, which means that you'll fundamentally have to choose between making all the powers basically the same, or making them different and accepting that it'll be a wild, wild world of imaginative combinations out there when the players get their hands on the system. I've been very fond of the way TSoY does this, which is why it seems like your game might benefit from a similar design philosophy as regards character powers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453948/#Comment_453948" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-18T17:20:24+00:00" title="June 18, 2016  5:20PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This might work for the Wu Wei stuff, via I ching trigrams.

So for example, instead of having the traditional wuxia ability of lightfoot, the hero has 'Lightfoot Tendons'.<br/><br/>Tian Code is powerful software derived from code based on the digital 'gods' - Hsien - of Tian, an ancient super-powerful galaxy spanning computer network.<br/><br/>Wu Wei, which I want to focus on now, is a set of mental disciplines that allow the practioner to create essentially magical or psychic effects. They are inspired by the 8 Trigrams, comprising a total of 8 Wu Wei Equations that are processed mentally to create effects.<br/><br/>A hero specialising in Wu Wei would have a corresponding Skill, the function of which is solely to Create Advantages. These would be aspects representing changes in the game world/narrative created by the mind of the practitioner, through his knowledge of 1 or more of the aforementioned equations.<br/><br/>There would then be around 8 stunts/effects representing these formulae to provide effects benefits or limits to how the aspects could be created. Otherwise how do i define what a hero can or can't do?<br/><br/>Could this work?<br/><br/>I want to stress that while these qualify as psychic powers, i'm not going solely for traditional psychic abilities such as telepathy or telekinesis.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455046/#Comment_455046" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-12T14:45:09+00:00" title="July 12, 2016  2:45PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, it looks like it could work.

This makes it difficult to answer a question like "how should I go about mechanically representing this idea" without considering just about everything involved in the game's design.<br/><br/>What this means in practice is that if my game is already using dice, then I'll know that economy of design makes using dice attractive in any new facets of the game as well; if one character class relies on lists of powers, then it is more attractive to do that with another as well; if I considered improvised GM judgements feasible in one matter, then I will probably find it feasible for another situation as well. Consistently developing the game from first principles ("this game uses dice") to a variety of practical outcomes ("here we roll to hit") makes the whole elegant and efficient.<br/><br/>Different games have different assumptions and requirements, different "footprints" in terms of required player skills, player resources and player enjoyments. By being consistent about your assumptions you can make your game work well for the subset of the audience that the game is truly intended for. Thus, when writing up e.g. a character class, you should already know whether your game is one of those games where the players use their imaginations to think up all kinds of magic effects on the basis of simple rules, or if it's one of those games where the players read many pages of mechanical intricacy and then apply those pre-written capabilities in a lawyerly process. Both types of games require different skills and are fun in different ways, so I cannot tell you which is the one your game should lean towards; it depends on what the game you are making is supposed to be like, whether it's a fish or a fowl.<br/><br/>Of course the various possible ways of describing a magic system also differ from each other in terms of designer effort; if you're making a miniatures skirmish game that needs dozens of different powers that the players can recombine in inventive ways during the game, the odds are that you'll have to do quite a bit of grunt-work to lay the landscape for the players; meanwhile, a Heroquest-like game can get by with a couple of paragraphs of description, as the only thing the game truly requires is for the players to know what kinds of things Wu Wei is generally supposed to accomplish, and the rest will come from their own imagination and judgement.<br/><br/>The amount of work is rarely the determining factor in how one goes about the design, though, as it is rare for a designer to be willing to compromise the quality of their game due to laziness; if they're already putting a lot of work into the game, it doesn't really make sense to start skimping on subsystems. The reason to opt for a lighter approach is that it's the right one for the game, not that it's easier.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455112/#Comment_455112" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-15T16:34:20+00:00" title="July 15, 2016  4:34PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nicely put, Eero.

The former is the region you grew up in, which offers a couple of basic kungfu. The latter is more of a character class from where the greater bulk of kungfu can be chosen. So a Wu Wei Practitioner would be a Faction. <br/><br/>This just seems easier.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
