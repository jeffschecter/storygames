I think a big part of it is your group's social dynamic, because any game can benefit from this.  But you need a degree of trust and flexibility as well as permission to throw stuff out and see what sticks - as well as permission to say "no".  This last point may be important - games where authority is clearly defined handle this better than those where it is not.  Like in Grey Ranks (just to pick a game we've both played recently out of the air) if you frame a Personal scene, it's all yours, so an atmosphere that encourages suggestions is fine and healthy, because you have explicit permission to ignore all of them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_194102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194102/#Comment_194102" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-25T10:26:47+00:00" title="February 25, 2009 10:26AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 25, 2009 10:35AM by David_Berg.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice, Jason, that totally adds up.  Forge some agreements about the parameters of the fiction you're creating, grab or generate some facts and color for inspiration springboard purposes, roll out a dynamic situation, and use rules that clearly state who can/should make suggestions/declarations when.  Voila!<br/><br/>I guess at this point there's a fairly long list of "Forge-style" games that do this, huh?<br/><br/>I've had this thought bouncing around for a while, for a game in which players posit competing new additions to the fiction, and then another player (or a group vote) determines which one is actually accepted, based more or less on "that would be the coolest addition to this narrative!"  Is there already some game that does that?  I know Universalis has some "put your money where your inspiration is"-type deal going on, which sounds similar in some ways (and maybe better), but meaningfully different.<br/><br/>What if all the narrative competitors were GMs, and the judge was the one player playing a character?  The GMs don't battle for what simply enters the setting, they battle for which of their setting entries is the one the chracter chooses to interact with.

It could even use a similar "inspiration springboard" procedure.  I could definitely improv cool rocks, rusty gates, strange animal noises, dropped diaries, etc. all day.  It certainly doesn't sound any harder than improvising compelling character behavior over and over!  But maybe that speaks to your point about a particular skill set.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Of course, if you're throwing out pure color with no plan, what happens when the character opts for your color?  How does that contribute to a playable situation?  Improvising an answer to <i>that</i> could get hard.  This might work best in a cosntrained environment like a whodunnit or a dungeon...<br/><br/>As for plan (a)... I could see the "winning" GM running with a situation while the two "losing" GMs think about how to work their respective contributions into it.  There could be defined options ("threat", etc.) to give them something to shoot for.  As opposed to plan (b), the "vote on contributions" phase would take longer (as GMs baked fuller contributions) and happen less frequently, and "winning" GMs would get a longer time to steer the fiction.<br/><br/>Man, I've threadjacked myself three times already.

Basically I want the collaboration before the conflict to help frame really good stakes on both the players and GM side, regardless of who get narration.<br/><br/>While the narration adds color and can twist things a bit, in general stake setting before hand avoids two problems<br/>1) having someone buy in with fanmail, win narration and take story somewhere unfun for the player having the conflict<br/>2) automatically negate what the original stakes rather than take the story somewhere more interesting<br/><br/>Both of these concerns are probably a result of running mostly convention games where folks will occasionally either freeze up when winning narration, or sometimes grief other players and the GM.
