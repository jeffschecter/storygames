Those event-cards are one of the most efficient setting-tools I've ever seen. They removes completely the need for a GM in this game. <br/><br/>Here's an example:<br/>_________________________________<br/><br/><b>Dead seagull on the beach</b><br/><br/>It has a needle through its head.<br/>_________________________________<br/><br/>1 - Players take turns drawing and reading the event-cards in the game.<br/><br/>2 - Drawing a card is a simple action, signaling that a new situation has arisen on the island. <br/><br/>3 - Reading the card is simple, as the text it never overly long (most are a bit longer than in the given example).<br/><br/>4 - After reading the card it is placed in the center of the table, and the standard evening conversation is played out. Anyone may join in. Very efficient!<br/><br/>When you read such a card, it feeds right into the weird and mysterious mood of the game. You've got a situation at hand, and at the same time some new weirdness of the setting has been established. And it is open for interpretation; the players are free to relate this element to the other elements of the game, as they see fit. And the game is all about the players exploring the situation and finding answers to the many mysteries. Their particular answers.

The economic aspect of it never worked, so I had to rethink how the economy of the characters would be simulated. I took to the use of a trait called "levek\xe5r" (may be translated as "living conditions"). This trait is expressed as a number, ranging from -2 to +7. Most people got the living conditions of 0 or +1. <br/><br/>The number symbolizes the coins, ordinary clothing, and ordinary items of the characters. No money is ever counted in the game, other than as part of in-character conversation. If they find a treasure, it is expressed in the levels of LC it may raise the characters (if they get to use it at a market or in a large city). The number is used as a bonus in certain actions (mostly social and political), but that is not the interesting thing here.<br/><br/>What <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is</span> interesting, is that, in order to make this work, I had to design a table of living conditions, with guidance on what a character could afford to buy, in an inn or at the market. And that table had to be placed in the hands of the players, to make them see this. And then I had to fill the rest of the sheet too, with lists of elements central to the game; titles, known songs, beasts of the wilderness, etc.<br/><br/>Thus I made a very strong setting tool; the players <b>resource-sheet</b>. It gives players lots of suitable elements to use when framing scenes, and helps us all knit our game-play more tightly to the framework of the setting. As a result the average play of the game has a more unison direction. It brings us closer to that hard-to-grasp quality of a strong-flowing narrative, while keeping the crunch and scope of the classical role-playing game.<br/><br/>The <i>resource-sheet</i> may be described as a reinvention of the "GM-screen" of old, for the direct benefit of the players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_313600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313600/#Comment_313600" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-22T05:04:45+00:00" title="February 22, 2011  5:04AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One setting tool I'm particularly fond of, is <b>the hand-drawn map</b> over a nation, a city or a village, with an info-bar on the side, containing a list of characters in that location, from high to low.

Sure, you can add at the bottom of the trait list that players can use the traits given as a springboard to their own, unique ones, but by making the connection between character and setting hook so plain by default it gets the players looking for ways to do so.<br/><br/>There's a school of thought that says that good chargen design should make it hard to create a 'bad' character- I'd certainly extend that to include making it hard or impossible to create a character without solid links to the setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313638/#Comment_313638" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-22T08:10:49+00:00" title="February 22, 2011  8:10AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tomas:<br/>If you like the <i>Until We Sink</i> example, have you considered chopping up your setting elements onto index cards and just putting them out there on the table top?<br/><br/>To me, it seems like the real problem with settings is that players just don't want to read the damn book and choose things they're interested in initially. (I certainly found that true with <i>Spione</i> for example).<br/><br/>I'm not suggesting doing it exactly like UWS. I'm thinking something less formal, a sort of feedback loop. As GM, pick out, I dunno, 20 elements keyed to the local starting point, plus a few keyed towards a slightly larger area. Then just scatter or deal a few out and leave the rest face up nearby or in the table center.<br/><br/>The idea here is that there's incomplete information on the parts of the players. You could, and probably should, still verbally sketch out the setting for the players. The individual cards might expand on bits of that verbal description, or re-inforce it.<br/><br/>Between sessions, more cards could be added. By the GM, these are bits of the expanded setting, including perhaps stuff affected by previous play. Players should also be able to add cards, based on things perhaps they've read about the setting between games (something I've found more likely once gaming has commenced. The info in the various VtM Clan books and other splats really played into this behavior).<br/><br/>The concept here is just plain based on human behaviors:<br/>Some players will desire at least a little bit of mastery and one upsmanship. Knowledge is a key part of that..<br/><br/>Some players will do better when they're connecting weirdly disconnected bits of info and then building a mental pattern based on it.<br/><br/>Similar to the above, some players will find it a jumping off place for creativity, especially when they can expand the connections or detail them further. I suspect this is where your vividness comes into play.<br/><br/>Admittedly, my take on this is very ad hoc and casual. I'm sure a better, more formalized pattern of use could be built. It would, I suspect, follow more closely some of the games I've played in where play evolves from a state of minimal understanding of the setting, mostly provided by the GM and in regard to a smallish area, to one that is more customized to player /character interests + GM input.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313642/#Comment_313642" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-22T08:35:25+00:00" title="February 22, 2011  8:35AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the setting tools in Dresden and Shock.<br/><br/>In Dresden Files: City creation. Use as much or little as you want. A little complex for my taste, but allows the setting to be designed more specifically by the players, but <i>not from scratch</i>. Also, the function of any FATE game to create the setting in play, the ability to put aspects on your surroundings, and then use them in a fight. This reinforces details, making the setting seem more alive, and valid, and vivid.<br/><br/>In Shock: Minutia. I find that, its not the big overarching setting you need in play, it's the details that make it vivid. I like both being in control of what these are, and being able to create them when they're necessary, especially in a sci-fi setting which is probably the setting most difficult to describe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_313691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313691/#Comment_313691" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-22T11:19:36+00:00" title="February 22, 2011 11:19AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>If you like the<i>Until We Sink</i>example, have you considered chopping up your setting elements onto index cards and just putting them out there on the table top?</blockquote>Yes, I have considered that, and have done some of it in my classical frpg <i>Fabula</i>. I like to think in <i>easy to handle elements</i> in both how I write the book, and how I organize play. My idea is that such elements are more flexible, and more inspiring.<br/><br/>But I'm not going all the way, as you suggest. There are multitudes of tools to choose from in design today. A lot of modern games have great new tools. But no tool is for every game. Designing nowadays is as much about choosing the right tools, as it is about inventing new ones.

Minutiae is good in most scenes, helping us to get a feel for the place. I believe it should be created on the spot, inspired by the location, and having players contributing here is invaluable.
