I'm all too familiar with that myself, though these days I no longer shy away from running something I fully expect to be a TPK.<br/><br/>(I still have only one of these under my belt (and only a low-level one), but otherwise my game's high bodycount is a source of pride -- because I work(ed) hard to become a killer DM and I consider it a requirement for this type of play, not because I'm a sadist.)<br/><br/>As a mental exercise, I'd like to assemble a list of the advantages (and perhaps disadvantages?) that the players' characters have over NPCs and monsters in OSR-style D&amp;D. <br/><br/>Off the top of my head, I can think of the following advantages:<br/><br/>1. PCs don't need to make morale checks (because the players decide when/if to run).<br/><br/>2. PCs might have better ability scores (only if 4d6-drop-lowest, arrange as desired etc. is used rather than 3d6-in-order). That said, the same process might be applied to classed NPCs.<br/><br/>3.  PCs might have a class or a superior class with various perks compared to normal men (usually only in later versions of D&amp;D, but I'm not really sure about this).<br/><br/>4. Players are less likely to play up disadvantageous superstitions and beliefs (e.g. "awed by authority") than the DM with the NPCs. YMMV (and if it does, tell us about it!).<br/><br/>5. Players outnumber the DM, so it's the creativity, tactical acumen etc. of an entire team versus that of the DM and perhaps a module's author.<br/><br/>6. PCs' often have a laser-like focus: Unless the DM and the rules maintain the fog of war, focus fire and ruthlessly geek-the-magician-first tactics etc. are the norm; some DMs might do this, too, but I, for instance, randomize target selection to maintain neutrality).<br/><br/>What else is there? Are there disadvantages, too?<br/><br/>(I have no problem with any of this, by the way. On the contrary, I find it emotionally satisfying that the players' characters get to beat opposition that may appear to be their equals or that technically outclasses them in terms of level, hit points etc.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/adamwb" title="adamwb"><img alt="adamwb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/adamwb">adamwb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470706/#Comment_470706" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-16T23:45:54+00:00" title="March 16, 2018 11:45PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 16, 2018 11:47PM by adamwb.">edited March 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            magic-users are very good<br/><br/>more than most npc or monster spellcasters, they can use their magic proactively to determine the site and terms of encounters. the dm only really gets one chance to do this, when creating the dungeon, the players can spend their whole lives trying out different versions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470721">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vivificient" title="Vivificient"><img alt="Vivificient" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/869/nJT73EZCYKXZO.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vivificient">Vivificient</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470721/#Comment_470721" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-17T17:53:11+00:00" title="March 17, 2018  5:53PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            PCs are a mixed force.

I'd say it applies to all PCs (though M-Us indeed have some of the best tools for this): Being the pro-active side, the one taking initiative, the invading force, the attackers etc. provides a distinct advantage that usually rests with the players.

I've read this whole thread an think you're all high. You're certainly not doing OSR the way I would do it. Honestly, it's been a long time since I Gm'ed a dungeon, but my feeling is that GMs (and designers) often treat monsters and other NPCs as if they couldn't co-ordinate themselves, as if they didn't know each other or know of each other's presence.  Monsters are always encoutered one after another (following the dungeon script) as if they were cardboard cut-out mooks with no co-ordination between them or no knowledge of their own environment.  <br/><br/>In a defensive battle 1:3, odds, defender to attacker, is more that enough to defeat the invading enemy.  <a href="/forums/profile/Komrade_Bob">@Komrade_Bob</a> wrote about this before me, but I'll repeat what he said, intelligent monsters (even kobalts) with home-field advantage should be able to move through the dungeon take advantage of choke points, higher ground, and alternate routes to get behind the enemy, to defeat even the most powerful enemies.  Every community has guards, and alarms and small triggers that warn them when something is wrong. A small tribe of 10 kobalts should easily defeat 30 levels of invading player-characters.  I'll repeat that.  A small tribe of kobalt should be able to defeat 30 levels of invaders.<br/><br/>IMHO, in real OSR play, the GM should be an vicious adversary! But that doesn't lend itself to a cool, heroic stories. So, yes, I'm questioning whether you're really doing OSR play, at least as I envison it.<br/><br/>This is a serious problem with both dungeon design and GMing.  All this talk about magic-users having the advantage of timing and location of battle, modern tactics, and player creativity is complete bullshit.  In a real dungeon, the first character killed (by missle fire) against an even marginally intelligent adversary would be the MU.  Now take into consideration lighting, terrrain, establish traps, etc. and player don't have any advantage at all.  TPK should be the norm!  One character in a whole party escaping the dungeon should be considered a victory!  But most people treat monsters like they're stupid.<br/><br/>The only reason that characters survive at all is unprepared and weak GMing. I partly blame this on bad dungeon design (for novice GMs).  If it is simulationist play (i.e. ORS), there should be instructions for the GM on how the monsters would stragegize against invaders, but I've seldom seen that.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470806/#Comment_470806" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-19T16:35:16+00:00" title="March 19, 2018  4:35PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Did you understand, Wanderer, that this thread is not describing procedural guarantees? These people are not listing things they give to the players free of charge when GMing; they're describing how the game plays for them, and what the emergent strengths and weaknesses of a typical PC adventuring party tend to be when compared to their opposition.<br/><br/>I wouldn't touch that "no true Scotsman" thing with a 10 foot pole; I'm not interested in what's "real OSR" and what's not. Description of how you play is appreciated, even if it seems to be a hypothetical stance in this case.<br/><br/>That being said, my experience is that there are a bunch of observable strategic strengths and weaknesses that adventuring parties have. Our ideal of challengeful D&amp;D play is very much about "what would really happen" wargaming, conscientiously ignoring concepts like game balance or sympathy for protagonists or anything like that. The procedures strive towards a happy optimum between neutrally refereed gameability and realism of outcomes.<br/><br/><b>Advantages that heroes tend to have in our campaigns:</b><br/><br/><b>Initiative:</b> They usually choose the time and place of the attack, even if they don't know what they're attacking against, and where. (I don't mean tactical initiative here.)<br/><br/><b>Faster OODA loop:</b> A combination of better information, training and purposefulness results in heroes being more tactically agile, being able to e.g. feign retreats and take intelligent risks.<br/><br/><b>Morale:</b> As has been observed, PCs don't traditionally take Morale checks except in extreme circumstances.<br/><br/><b>Advantages that the monsters tend to possess:</b><br/><br/><b>Numbers:</b> There's usually more dungeon denizens than heroes.<br/><br/><b>Terrain:</b> They're more familiar and better adapted to the environment than the heroes.<br/><br/><b>Advantages that sometimes favour one and sometimes the other side:</b><br/><br/><b>Strategic perspective:</b> Sometimes the heroes know what they're after, while the monsters don't know it. Sometimes it's the other way around.<br/><br/><b>Force Quality:</b> Sometimes the monsters are sub-level rabble, while sometimes the heroes are all 1st level and they're facing grotesquely superhuman things.<br/><br/><b>Knowledge gap:</b> Sometimes the monsters don't recognize e.g. a magic-user, while other times the adventurers fail to recognize what it is that they're fighting.<br/><br/>All in all, it's very similar to a viking or nomad raid of the pre-industrial times.

The history of warfare recognizes many circumstances that are advantageous to the defender, but also there are many factors that benefit an attack. Success on the attack often relies on force multipliers and negating factors that make defensive planning useless.<br/><br/>As I intimated above, we're basically talking about viking raids here. Few would say that vikings could not possibly achieve their strategic objectives because they're inherently on the attack, and therefore the defenders should be able to overcome them.<br/><br/>For example, one of the basic tactics for a dungeon raid in a realistic campaign is advance scouting, followed by a surprise assault. The kobolds are caught by surprise, scattered in confusion and hunted down or pinned down by a foe who moves according to a preplanned schedule and refuses to get pinned down in turn.<br/><br/>(The ideal counter-tactic for that is a combination of hard blockades and traps. An enemy trying a fast raid will run straight into a trap, should one be laid on their route. A hard blockade like a barred door takes time to bring down, which loses the surprise advantage. These are the primary reasons for why the smart captain does not commit to a lightning raid without a successful scouting mission; you need to know where you target is, and that there aren't hard blockades or traps on the way.)<br/><br/>Another basic tactic is the dungeon siege approach, in which the party advances slowly and carefully, takes control of travel junctions to curtail enemy movement, and ultimately pins the enemy down in a dead-end to finish them. (Alternatively, depending on the strategic goals, you simply force your way through enemy territory to get what you came for, and then get out the same way you came in.) Ambushes and traps are dealt with by tactical scouting, hard obstacles are cleared, and outright assaults by the enemy are conquered with defensive tactics.<br/><br/>(This latter approach is something that the local gamers here have elevated into a high art. Use of canaries - animal scouts - to trigger traps and dangers, portable barricade constructions to retain control of dungeon corridors, guards to control the retreat route and other similar solutions enable the party to crush forces many times their own size as long as the foe is not organized and prepared for an advanced siege assault.)<br/><br/>Of course it tends to be the case that the ideal tactics for various situations require resources that the party doesn't have at low levels, which may force the adventurers to default to "let's open that door to find out what's behind it" play. My own experience is that even advanced players who are fully aware of the tactical possibilities will often default to surprisingly "naive" tactics at campaign start; the resources you have at 1st level before that first successful heist are simply so scarce that the best strategy seems to be to treat the dungeon expedition as a light scouting mission. With luck you'll find something without having to fight anything, and maybe with this initial funding you can then build up the party to be able to actually accomplish planned objectives.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470828/#Comment_470828" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-20T04:42:36+00:00" title="March 20, 2018  4:42AM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First, I would like to apologize for my coarse language earlier.

I don't want to get into a long, drawn-out discussion about this because I don't really care about OSR that much, except for one aspect: respect the monsters.<br/><br/>Monsters are smart, even lowly kobalds.  They know they are living in a dangerous environment and in dangerous times.  For the most part, they know they are being hunted by adventurers--surely kobald foklore tells of this. They can have made plans and have contingencies. They often have their own magic which they should know how to use effectively.  They can have thoroughly explored the dungeon.  And they can change the dungeon once an invasion starts.  Anything less than that and it seems like one is abusing the monsters.<br/><br/>There was a question lurking behind my original screed.  Why do the players have these advantages (most of them listed here, anyway) in actual play?  A dungeon (in the classic sense) is not a Saxon village or an undefended monastery.  It is an easily defendable fortress of sorts. Initiative doesn't matter that much in this kind of situation--it's not an open battlefield.

So when you claim that people play monsters soft, or that we're not accounting for this or that strategic factor, you're not revealing a revolutionary insight - you're basically accusing a large, unspecified group of people of failing in doing what they're trying to do. How do you know that I am failing, specifically?<br/><br/>That's like claiming that "story gamers wouldn't know a good story if it bit them in the ass, I'm annoyed by how clueless they are about how to go about it. I haven't really played any story-oriented games for 20 years myself - I don't even like them - but I would still do it better than these bozos."<br/><br/>Is that really the message you're trying to convey?<br/><br/>That aside, here are some answers to your concerns:<br/><br/>First, kobolds do not need to be inhuman murder machines that are prepared for an existential threat 24/7. If they are, that's a major, major facet of their character, a game-changer much more important than a paltry hit die here or there. I actually wrote an adventure where the central challenge involved just <i>one</i> kobold-equivalent equipped with the psychotic focus of a true wargame pawn.<br/><br/>Of course you can imagine your kobolds any way you want, but I think that in most people's games they go into the same general box with all the other low-level humanoid rabble - there are campaign-specific cultural quirks, but their general cognitive and social processes are similar enough to humans. They hunt and gather, they have families, they have leaders. They do not stand guard every moment of their life waiting for some adventurers to come contest them in an initiative check. Alternatively, it's pretty popular to make them fey magical critters of some sort; again, not ideal soldiers.<br/><br/>If the kobolds knew that they could be beset by adventurers at any moment, why would they even be there? <i>That</i> would be actually stupid, much more so than being caught unaware by the first human explorers stupid enough to delve into their caves in a long time.<br/><br/>Second, if you decide to create an adventure location that is the ideal fortress inhabitated by the ideal soldier, then <i>of course</i> it is going to be tough going for the attacker. You know what your average old school dungeon is not? One of these ideal fortresses, that's what. I've played a number of old and retro D&amp;D dungeons over the last decade myself, and the general trend has been that the humanoid monster lairs have a relatively low alert level, reasonable close guard and inadequate perimeter patrols. This often makes sense, as the humanoid groups don't have enough numbers for actually useful patrolling, and they're clearly not expecting an attack when the adventurers first arrive. The typical lair is much more like a primitive village (that happens to be underground) than a devious murder-maze.<br/><br/>That situation changes completely once the monsters are placed in a military situation that they recognize as a serious, existential threat. It is a stupid adventuring party that decides to go against such opposition. My humanoids have been known to do anything ranging from traps to allies to outright moving out of the dungeon when the adventurers have given them strategic room to maneuver in.<br/><br/>I've read about Tucker's kobolds same as everybody else, and I'm willing to implement that when and where it makes sense, but it's not the default position of every intelligent monster in your typical D&amp;D campaign. The average humanoid tribe doesn't really get the chance to turn their home into a murder-maze before the adventurers have already either succeeded or failed in their goals.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/manixur" rel="nofollow">manixur</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>(If a dozen orcs pick one PC to shoot all their arrows at, they're far more effective than if they separately aimed at random, but this requires a GM/referee pretty much picking a player to die.)</p></div></blockquote>\nMy orc-equivalents shoot at the enemy leader if they get the chance. This requires them to recognize the leader and be in a position to try for them. Failing that, the orcs will do a general volley.<br/><br/>Both are reasonable things to try in D&amp;D when you remember that hit points aren't visible on the outside. Most peoples in my campaigns "know about hit points" in the sense that they have cultural beliefs about heroes and divine favour and other such things (which hit points pretty much represent, insofar as they can be said to represent anything). This might cause some given orcs to not bother with the bows against a famous hero because "it wouldn't work anyway", but it might just as well cause them to all focus fire on that famous hero in an attempt to take them down before they'll kill them all.<br/><br/>And yeah, player characters do routinely die when they end up on the receiving end of something like that. The GM's gotta be tough enough to kill them when the occasion arises, or otherwise the game's no fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470859/#Comment_470859" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-21T04:07:50+00:00" title="March 21, 2018  4:07AM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 21, 2018 4:15AM by Paul_T.">edited March 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like this discussion of "how hard do you play the monsters?"; I think it's a fundamentally interesting question for OSR play.<br/><br/>My own solution to it has been to create a monster creation procedure which informs me whether the monsters are organized, military-minded, and/or cooperative (or to randomize that, if it's unknown). Some are simply a family living underground, and bicker amongst themselves. At the opposite end of the spectrum, they may be telepathically-linked warriors with predetermined defensive patterns.<br/><br/>I like the variety of situations this gives us in play, and the guidance it gives me as a GM.<br/><br/>However, I DO believe that, in any case:<br/><br/>1. It's a bit of a sliding scale. I like it when the monsters' response to the players is believable and interesting: if they are intelligent, they will prepare for a "second visit" in intelligent ways (a good reason for adventurers to consider carefully whether they're willing to retreat from a dungeon, to come back later!).<br/><br/>2. However, I think there's a totally valid school of OSR play where monsters operate as random fighting creatures with little sense or organization, as well. The rules and the reality of the situation still make play dangerous and strategic. <br/><br/><i>For an example, see this actual play: <br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/18249/the-osr-in-vivid-colour-an-actual-play" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/18249/the-osr-in-vivid-colour-an-actual-play</a></i><br/><br/>3. In any case, though, generally speaking in OSR play the PCs benefit from a sort of <i>attention advantage</i>. <br/><br/>A group of several intelligent people totally focused on finding successful strategies and very few constraints (they can use their full skillset here) are up against a single person who has a million other things to manage and doesn't spend all of their time thinking about how to get maximal use out of a wheelbarrow and a barrel of oil.<br/><br/>The players can focus entirely on this task; the GM has many other duties (in some groups, perhaps even helping the players come up with a good plan or brainstorming with them!). In addition, the GM generally must "handicap themselves" to remain impartial. For instance, Eero and I will both occasionally use a randomizer to see if an enemy <i>really could</i> come up with such a clever plan.<br/><br/>Between the "attention advantage" and the GM's need to "remain hygienic", the players are going to have better, more thought-out (or, at least, more creative) planning. And I think that's part of the fun: cleverness prevailing over what should have been impossible odds, simply because we, as a group, are willing to devote 8 hours and three separate tries to solving something. The opposition rarely gets that kind of attention or opportunity.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470860/#Comment_470860" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-21T04:14:44+00:00" title="March 21, 2018  4:14AM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 21, 2018 4:18AM by Paul_T.">edited March 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This same principle applies when it comes to adjudication:<br/><br/>I believe that the most functional way to play in this style is for the referee to attempt to be as impartial as possible... but, in edge cases, to always err on the side of the players.<br/><br/>No point wasting good will just to make the game harder, in other words - there will always be another challenge around the corner.<br/><br/>I know there are some "killer GMs" out there, but, in my experience, this is less fun as a game and less appropriate from a social perspective. When I run an OSR game, I'll set up the dungeon or the opposition to be extremely challenging when that's what the situation calls for, but if there's some kind of misunderstanding or mistake in play, I'll always adjudicate it in the favour of the players (and, likely, then explain how it will be handled in the future).<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">@Adam_Dray</a> said this well when we played D&amp;D together: <br/><br/>"The dungeon isn't fair, but I am."<br/><br/>In <b><i>ideal play</i></b>, this would never come into effect - the referee would be free to be perfectly impartial. In actual practice, though, there will be situations where someone misunderstood something someone else said, and this put a PC in danger, someone's cat knocked over a lucky roll, and so forth. <br/><br/>Over time, this can be an advantage in the PCs' favour.<br/><br/>This also shows itself in the design of the rules, of course: in most rulesets, for instance, there might be a "death save" kind of system (to survive deadly situations) which works for PCs but is rarely applied to monsters, the monsters don't "gain XP" for killing PCs, and so forth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/manixur" title="manixur"><img alt="manixur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/manixur">manixur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470863/#Comment_470863" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-21T05:17:36+00:00" title="March 21, 2018  5:17AM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>2.

It was a tough fight. The PCs outnumbered the defenders 2:1 thanks to auxillaries but only through application of magical Darkness (something the defenders were not used to, no creatures on that dungeon level use magic) and improvised siege equipment did they succeed (at the loss of  1 PC and 9 auxillaries).<br/><br/>I think coordination and speed of communication is a big advantage for the PCs. I'm usually lax with allowing them to discuss tactics mid battle even when their characters don't have time or range to do so. I'm less lenient when it comes to them giving orders to henchmen or mercenaries. The party essentially acts as a hive-mind or experienced soldiers who support each other with no or minimal communication, I don't let them use mercenaries as perfect additions to the hive-mind. I do my best to make sure the monsters play in Fog of War and the players are very vigilant to when it's broken on accident (if their opponents ever had telepathy or a messenger system faster than movement speed they would notice right away through induction).<br/><br/>In short, they take full advantage of their OODA loop. In some cases they don't and the result is often a full retreat when they notice they risk being cut off or outnumbered. It would be possible to enforce realistic communications but I think that would suck the pace out of the game. But who knows, it might give an extra dimension just as counting torches and hit points does.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470878">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470878/#Comment_470878" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-21T16:38:51+00:00" title="March 21, 2018  4:38PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">@Hopeless_Wanderer</a>,<br/><br/>Personally, I rather enjoy your contributions to these discussions, and hope you don't stop.<br/><br/>Eero is right that you slipped a bit into a "you're all doing it wrong!1!1!!!1!!!" tone there, but I like hearing your take on this thing, and would like to hear more.

As you say, Krippler, it's very natural for the format for the GM to simulate these things precisely, while the players basically do the super-fast thinking (as in: they use more real time than the characters have in game time) hive-mind thing.<br/><br/>Much of this has to do with the fact that kibitzing is a constant and central part of the game's enjoyment: when stuff happens to other people's characters, you want to be involved in pondering the conundrum. And if you do that, then you're naturally going to be making suggestions and maintaining a big picture in combat as well.<br/><br/>Probably the way to try out harder procedures in this regard would be in a chat or video chat game where the GM could maintain partition of information and communication in a much sharper way, much easier.<br/><br/>The best tabletop approach I've tried is to add artificial static to the processes of the players, basically the way <i>Pendragon</i> does it: have them roll various observation, wit, initiative checks at appropriate times to find out what the characters have time and presence of mind to plan and communicate. Failures force the characters into doing things that may or may not be what the player would have chosen anyway. Basically the player still has his privileged god-like wargamer view of the action, but sometimes his options are limited by the internal failings of his own character.<br/><br/>If anybody wants to try that approach, I suggest starting with a simple <i>idea saving throw</i>: any time another player gives you an idea that you intend to execute, you either have to establish that the characters had time to plan together, or you have to roll a save to see if your character manages to invent/hear/understand the idea. If you fail, you are obligated to do <i>anything else but</i> the suggested idea.<br/><br/>I guarantee that the players will quickly get much more careful about when they open their mouths, and whether the other players <i>really</i> need you to coordinate their actions [grin]. The best thing about that rule is that it produces hilarious situations, of course. "What, now I have to go left just because you told me to go right?"<br/><br/>Adding a time limit is the other low-maintenance solution. It's just not entirely conceptually clear where and how much time pressure there should be: most people would agree that it's part of the game that the players, unlike their characters, have the luxury to stop and enjoy a particularly screwy situation.<br/><br/>A third basic idea is to just say that only the players of Fighting-Men get to speak during a combat sequence at all. Others only get to write their actions. Rough but quick way to add back some of that combat confusion, plus you can never give Fighters too much privilege.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sadurian" title="Sadurian"><img alt="Sadurian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sadurian">Sadurian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470880/#Comment_470880" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-21T17:17:55+00:00" title="March 21, 2018  5:17PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 21, 2018 5:21PM by Sadurian.">edited March 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My take on the classic OSR dungeoneering adventurers is not that they consider themselves soldiers who will assault underground fortresses head-on and expect to have to conform to the 3:1 offence/defence odds to gain success (not always the case in real life, of course).<br/><br/>Instead, the PCs are the special forces. They are the infiltration team who are going in hard and fast and focussed. They avoid the huge barracks of armed hobgoblins and instead take a short-cut to the treasure/hostage/maguffin.<br/><br/>Now sometimes the party will, through inexperience, bad luck or player <del>stupidity</del> poor decision-making, meet the enemy warriors head-on in a toe-to-toe fight. In that case my GMing would lead me towards demonstrating what a bad idea this is and that planning to run away is a good idea. <br/><br/>As the GM I don't want a TPK. I don't like running games as competitions between GM and players where I am actively trying to kill the PCs. I like the idea of characters developing and of players becoming fond of their character and party. I even run Call of Cthulhu in a way that allows most characters to continue (in time). I don't run Hackmaster and my decision-making changes according to the situation. I'll throw a bone to the inexperienced player who forgot that his Bard was as useful in melee as a five-year-old with a sponge finger. <br/><br/>Remember that not all aspects of OSR power-levels are obvious to the PCs. That well-dressed hobgoblin might be a wealthy first-level type, or he might be an 18th level high priest of {insert death god here} (I know that OSR generally doesn't give levels to monsters, but hopefully you see the point). If the relative power level is obvious (1st level adventurers facing ogres) then the players have the advantage of reacting by avoiding contact. If they choose to charge in even after some carefully phrased snippets of GM advice framed as observations, well, that's up to them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470941/#Comment_470941" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-22T04:54:02+00:00" title="March 22, 2018  4:54AM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I absolutely minimize player kibbitzing during combat.

At 3:1, you're likely to win, but only with some casualties. At 6:1 you usually brutally overwhelm them without the victims being able to effectively respond. Keeping in mind that this is all more complex than 6 dudes and 1 dude in a blank room with sticks. Go read something grognardly to get a better idea where this comes from, like something by James F. Dunnigan.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As for killing low level parties with not too many kobolds, no need to get into unfair GM knowledge or Tucker type antics. It's really more a combination of these following things:<br/><br/>1) A particular reading of the Basic D&amp;D optional Morale rules and implementing it. Specifically, a reading that says morale checks are made, among other times, when <span style="text-decoration: underline;">anyone</span> first takes damage. Which, depending on how you read it, could mean when kobolds inflict damage as well as when they take it. Kobold morale sucks. They could feasibly ambush the party with ranged weapons, inflict damage, then immediately bug out. And do this repeatedly throughout the complex, creating a running ( literally running) fight.<br/><br/>2) The movement rate rules for exploration and mapping combined with encumbrance rules. You move significantly faster in combat. In your home turf ( or mapped and explored areas), you can use the full move rate not your mapping exploration rate. Kobolds are pretty likely to be on their home turf and largely unencumbered ( little to no armour, very basic weapons, not much else). The PC party is likely to be sticking together and moving at the rate of their slowest member. If quicker members break off to pursue...well, the rule about not splitting the party exists for real if often unexamined reasons.<br/><br/>3) Lighting distance and encounter distance<br/><br/>You remembered light sources and/or demi humans, right? Kobolds are often going to activate beyond the distance of your light source radius. Especially in a long straight hallway, they'll be able to see you, inside that radius, long before you can see them.<br/><br/>Which, as you can imagine, has some unfortunate implications for the tactical situation when combined with points 1 &amp; 2 above.<br/><br/>While I doubt my kobolds are smart enough to gank the Magic User first, they may well gank the guys with the torches first, since the kobolds can see without those light sources.<br/><br/>4) Wait, so the Kobolds all ran away and left their treasure! Bonus!<br/><br/>Enh, not so much. If you ran after them, you weren't mapping and may well be lost and have to start over, mapping from where you are, but now you're encumbered by treasure. You may have lost party members or at least used up a fair bit of your healing resources.<br/><br/>Now you have to get back through the caverns in the opposite direction, but more slowly. If there are any secret and /or unexplored passages and loop backs in the complex, now it's just a matter of setting up a bunch of quick side-hall ambushes with ranged weapons and refusing to go toe-to-toe in melee, all the way back to the end of the complex, or at least the end of kobold territory. Maybe further, like in the forest on the way back to civilization, if they're really mad at you. All while focussing on minimizing their own casualties.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
