Is it possible without a moderator?<br/><br/>    Lordy, I Hope - The Hearing Game<br/><br/>    This is a minigame to simulate a conversation which takes the format of a hearing, questioning, or any similar and pointed discussion. It is mostly intended for use within RPGs, but may be played by itself if desired. It requires an impartial moderator, two other players, three six-sided dice, and some pencil and paper.<br/><br/>    Setup<br/><br/>    The first thing to be done is for the moderator to brief the two players on the topic of their debate. For example, the moderator may say, \u201cJames Comey and Senator Rubio will debate the issue of Comey\u2019s firing from the FBI and the organization\u2019s ongoing investigations.\u201d<br/><br/>    Drafting<br/><br/>    Now each player gets an opportunity to draft their lines of attack and responses.<br/><br/>    -The Questioner<br/><br/>    The player who will be doing the questioning gets 6 lines on their sheet. Each line should contain a short summary of a line of attack or topic they may wish to touch on. These do not need any specific order, but may wish to be somewhat general as they will need to be combined with other items on the list to form questions. Rubio may for example list \u201cHillary\u2019s emails\u201d or \u201cTrump is new\u201d among other things.<br/><br/>    -The Questioned<br/><br/>    The player who is being questioned gets 7 lines on their sheet. They should place their most central response/argument in the center 4th line. James Comey, for example, may place \u201cTrump said \u2018I hope you can let this go\u2019\u201d on that line.<br/><br/>    The lines radiating out from the center one should have decreasing relevance as they get further away. For example, Comey imagines Republicans may ask about emails and Democrats may focus on Trump firing him. So he places those two below and above his center line, since they are tangential but highly relevant. The ones below and above those should again have decreasing relevance, and so on until the sheet is full. The 7th line will come up the least, so should be the most specific or tangential.<br/><br/>    -Review<br/><br/>    Depending on the moderator\u2019s wishes, he may review the lines of attack and response sheets for relevance. For a more humorous game, skip this step.<br/><br/>    Gameplay<br/><br/>    Now the game begins. The game consists of players either asking questions or giving responses. Whatever a player says is their final response, and the moderator must make their call regarding if it is suitable. Players do not get a second chance. Play immediately passes as soon as a player has made their statement and the moderator has ruled.<br/><br/>    Questioning<br/><br/>    The questioning player begins. He rolls 2 dice and references the matching lines of his lines of attack. Now his job is to link the topics on those lines of his sheet together in order to form a coherent question. If he can accomplish this task using the two rolls he originally got, he makes a check mark on one of the matching lines, and receives a token. If he decides he can only utilize one of the two rolls, he may adjust another die to a line on his sheet that he can work with. The other player receives one token for each line that he moves (so Rubio going from a roll of 6 to a roll of 5 would award Comey 1 token). If the player decides not to adjust, but is relevant to one die roll, he simply does not receive a checkmark.<br/><br/>    Response<br/><br/>    After the question is given, the player under questioning goes. He rolls a single die and looks at the matching line of his sheet. If he can form a coherent response to the specific question just asked by utilizing that line of his sheet, he receives a check mark there. If he can use either line adjacent to that line, nothing is received by either player. If he can use lines any farther away than that, the other player receives 1 token for each extra line away (so if Comey rolled a 4, and uses the 2nd line for his response, the 3rd line is his \u201cfree\u201d line, while getting to the 2nd line means Rubio receives one token).<br/><br/>    Tokens<br/><br/>    One token may be spent for one reroll at any time, even on the other player\u2019s dice.<br/><br/>    Judgment<br/><br/>    The moderator must decide that a player's question or response makes sense and meets their dice roll criteria. Any player ruled by the moderator to have given an incoherent or irrelevant response must erase a checkmark from their sheet. Judgments made by the moderator are final.<br/><br/>    Winning<br/><br/>    The first player to have placed 6 checkmarks on 6 different lines wins (it is not necessary for the player under questioning to place a checkmark on line 7, and indeed impossible).<br/><br/>    Competence Variants<br/><br/>    It is possible that you want to simulate a more or less competent individual in either role.<br/><br/>    Questioner<br/><br/>    For a sharper questioner, give them three dice. Any two of these may be used for the response. To play with a worse questioner (\u201cJohn McCain style\u201d), give the player three dice. All three must be used together to earn a checkmark.<br/><br/>    Questioned<br/><br/>    To play with a sharper person under questioning, allow them to roll two dice and choose either one. To play with a worse person under questioning, make them roll two dice and utilize both.<br/><br/>    Regardless of the use of these variants, only one checkmark can be earned in a single player\u2019s turn."<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463777/#Comment_463777" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-09T15:09:43+00:00" title="June  9, 2017  3:09PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is pretty interesting. Has anyone tried this?<br/><br/>I like how it forces people to work with certain topics when framing the conversation.<br/><br/>I don't love the necessity of a moderator to determine the outcomes of each turn. It would be great to reframe this somehow so that the two participants make that decision for each other (with appropriate tradeoffs), and perhaps an "audience" role for the people who are listening and trying to make up their mind about the issue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RickDean" title="RickDean"><img alt="RickDean" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/466/nYRCWQBW2OXHC.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RickDean">RickDean</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463804/#Comment_463804" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-10T03:45:56+00:00" title="June 10, 2017  3:45AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm also not sure it needs all the randomization. The questioner could have a list of questions and the questioned could have a list of responses and they could freely choose which to use, but would be penalized for using the same arguments repeatedly. You would want to save your really good questions/responses for crucial moments, making for some almost push-your-luck tension.<br/><br/>I think having a couple rounds could be cool to give the players a chance to adapt their strategy after a round of questioning. Definitely needs some play testing and refinement but I like the concept.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463832/#Comment_463832" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-11T07:44:11+00:00" title="June 11, 2017  7:44AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm thinking Microscope. Instead of Eras, Events, Scenes, you have Topics, Points, Validity-checks. E.g. topic: Trump is new, Point: New people should be cut slack, Vc: Is this a valid enough point that's applicable here? Talk it out. I.e. there are limits to the slack available <small>fnord</small>, or new people should be held fully accountable, etc etc.<br/>Always with dialectics between 1. The Vc should be about that point and that point only, not bring in other points or over other topics. But, (and this is in practice the more common error), 2. The arguers should keep the full scope of the argument in mind and not quibble over an almost irrelevantly minor point. <br/><br/>As per Microscope, each topic can contain many points and each point can have several aspects to Vc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
