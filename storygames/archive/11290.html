You are in the Lair of the Possessed Otyugh. You are standing in the rubble of a partially collapsed tunnel. Ahead of you is a door. You pry open the jammed door and...<br/><b>Luke</b>: Enter the Preparation Room. The room is lit by guttering tallow lanterns. Tables covered in jars line the room. A slab for embalming bodies rests in the center of the room. A corridor leaves ahead of you and another entrance on your left leads to a small room.<br/><b>Luke</b>: Choose your path!<br/><b>Razor</b>: Enter the small room<br/>4:24 PM<br/><b>Luke</b>: It is dark in here. The light from the Preparation Room only dimly highlights the shadows. The small room is lined with three cells on the facing wall. The cell on your left contains a stiffened corpse. The center cell contains a pile of rubble. From the cell on the right, you can hear whimpering and grunting. What do you do?<br/><b>Razor</b>: Search the rubble<br/><b>Luke</b>: The door is locked, but as you get closer to the grill, you discern something blacker than black in the cell...a tunnel leading out!<br/><b>Razor</b>: Talk to whoever\u2019s in the right cell<br/><b>Luke</b>: It appears to be a starving man in priest\u2019s robes. \u201cLet me out,\u201d he says, \u201cplease.\u201d<br/><b>Luke</b>: \u201cYou\u2019ve all gone mad.

Too late, you realize the chest was trapped.<br/><b>Luke</b>: A poisoned needle shoots forth and lodges itself between the first and second knuckle of your sword hand. Your arm goes numb and you drop your fabled blade.<br/><b>Razor</b>: Noooo!<br/><b>Razor</b>: Search chest<br/><b>Luke</b>: You haul the chest out into the light, spilling its contents on the ground.

Magic flows through you and the edges of objects take on a ghostly dwoemer. Lantern light leaves trailing streaks in your vision.

They lie in ambush.<br/><b>Razor</b>: Kick ghouls<br/><b>Luke</b>: The ghouls cannot be attacked from this vantage point.

They appear to be unaware of your presence until you look into a murder hole. You look straight into the yellow, bloodstained eyes of a man transformed into a ghoul by foul magic. You both scream. He runs deeper into his chamber -- seemingly a great underground temple -- and you lose your hold and fall to the corridor floor with a thump.<br/><b>Luke</b>: A booming roar echoes through the corridors. The ghouls squeal in terror in the distance.<br/><b>Luke</b>: You have awoken something.<br/><b>Razor</b>: Go back to cellblock!<br/><b>Luke</b>: You scramble back to through the Preparation Room into the cell room.

So I suppose I owe Alexander for the inspiration.<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously, it's problematic. The values for the player's attributes become known after each is used. And the "GM" player can choose deliberately broad search terms to win a challenge. (Murder holes? Come on.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe trick is to institute a rule that makes the search terms as florid and obscure as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe range of results is too wild to use the margin of difference between the two, but I'm itching to try to use the actual page results in play. Somehow tie resolution into the first page that turns up.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm also trying to figure a way to use "I'm feeling lucky." I'm thinking that maybe a quoted search term in that mode that turns up a result is a critical hit or special effect or something.<br/>\n<br/>\n-L                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_250776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250776/#Comment_250776" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-14T08:30:57+00:00" title="January 14, 2010  8:30AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Definitely some neat things going on here.

If you get 349859456 results, that gets you a 56. Probably too hard to "game" and it becomes noise at that significance in a wide search. <br/><br/>You might also ask the player to choose one word from the aspect you're searching, and each word can be used only once per session. Give players a 12-word budget or something to create their characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_250782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250782/#Comment_250782" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-14T08:44:28+00:00" title="January 14, 2010  8:44AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The great thing about the search mechanism resolution is that it's simple and it looks like normal office behavior.

Rather, you might think of those PC aspects as touchpoints that give meaning to the otherwise arbitrary numbers that spring up. The only way to tell if a million hits is a big or small number in this system is if you have some constant to compare with - and if you know that a million hits is enough to beat aspects A and B of the hero but not C, then that seems like a good thing to me. Of course there needs to be some reasoning that limits the player from always picking his best aspect in every conflict, but that's an old problem with a zillion solutions.<br><br>(Probably still a good idea to make the aspects only semi-permanent, just to mix things up a bit. But changing them after each conflict seems unnecessarily random to me.)<br><br>Anyway, an excellent way of making use of the microdungeons. You can feel the imaginative pressure in the play account.

Through watering eyes, you see more murder holes in the left hand wall. This corridor is a mirror image of the other on the opposite side. Through the murder hole you see the back of another cloaked ghoul. He\u2019s standing atop a pile of offal, shoveling it into a pit that appears to be roaring and writhing. The sound of running water comes from within that room. You cannot get there from here.<br/>Light trickles through the murder hole. You see another smaller room behind you at the end of the corridor.

They lead to the murder holes. At the top of the refuse pile is an opening. Water runs from the opening down into the pit. A ghoul cultist stands atop the pile, shovelling garbage down into the pit. The pit contains a writhing mass of flesh and tentacles, \u201cFEEEEDMMME.\u201d it bellows. \u201cYOUR GOD HUNGERS.\u201d  The ghoul leads you to a side table on which sit tainted vessels full of corrupted wine and water. \u201cDrink.

I think it was productive in terms of design, authority and content. <br/>Read on, if you can stomach the stench of the Lair of the Possessed Otyugh!<br/><br/><b>Luke</b>: Okay, where were we?<br/><b>Razor</b>: My arcane amulet was destroying the Otyugh!<br/><b>Luke</b>: Oh, that\u2019s not quite how I remember it.<br/><b>Razor</b>: LOL \u201cThe amulet explodes in burst of arcane fury. Eldritch energy courses down the foetid tentacles, arching into the tooth maw of the fell beast. It writhes and shivers. The ghouls howl. The bellowing beast falls mute. The ghouls whimper.\u201d<br/><b>Razor</b>: Well, he fell mute<br/><b>Luke</b>: You won the talk challenge. You silenced him and convinced him that if he ate you he\u2019d have to answer to the God of Gods.<br/><b>Razor</b>: Yes. That\u2019s accurate. But I\u2019m still in his clutches, I believe?<br/><b>Luke</b>: You are indeed in its clutches, dangling over its maw.<br/><b>Luke</b>: New Rule time<br/><b>Razor</b>: Shoot<br/><b>Luke</b>: The Narrator (that\u2019s me) must use search terms either from the microdungeon itself or directly based on the action transpiring in the narration. The Narrator may not use the hero\u2019s aspects as search terms unless he explicitly gains control of them via a challenge (or is somehow given the aspect via the hero\u2019s actions in play).<br/><b>Razor</b>: Ok! But you haven\u2019t done that yet, have you? You haven\u2019t used any of my aspects as search terms yet<br/><b>Luke</b>: Correct, but I could have if I had wanted to. Nothing was stopping me. Now there\u2019s a rule.<br/><b>Razor</b>: Gotcha.<br/><b>Luke</b>: Es claro?<br/><b>Razor</b>: Si, claro.<br/><b>Luke</b>: New Rule Time <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a><br/><b>Razor</b>: k<br/><b>Luke</b>: Stuff found or acquired in the dungeon grants the player new aspects that can be used in challenges, but these items or effects have limited uses. Limits can be a number of uses as determined by the narrator when the aspect is gained or a limit to what challenges the aspect can be used in -- talk, search, attack or improvise.<br/><b>Razor</b>: cool. got it.<br/><b>Luke</b>: I think both of those were implicit in play, but they\u2019re important and good enough to state explicitly.<br/><b>Razor</b>: Okay. Sounds good.<br/><b>Luke</b>: So can we look at your amulet? How would you like to treat it? Would you like to take limited uses or limit it to specific challenges? I personally think the latter.<br/><b>Razor</b>: Specific challenges for sure. So far I\u2019ve used it for Talk only, I think<br/><b>Luke</b>: I think Talk and Search. Well, you did use it for one Attack challenge, but you used it to convince a ghoul there... to convince the ghoul and search the Sacristy<br/><b>Razor</b>: hrm. well if I had to pick one type, i\u2019d pick talk.<br/><b>Luke</b>: I don\u2019t want to cheat you out of your arcane amulet. I just want to nail down what it does. So if it works for Talk and Search, it works for Talk and Search. (I don\u2019t want you attacking me with it in the next scene!). I think this is a good rule for making items varied, useful and graded in power. If your amulet is for Talk and Search, imagine the godly might you\u2019d possess if it worked for all four!<br/><b>Razor</b>: I agree!<br/><b>Luke</b>: Are we settled then?<br/><b>Razor</b>: Settled.<br/>12:37 PM<br/><b>Luke</b>: You are a sick, poisoned rootless wanderer wearing demon\u2019s skin boots and bearing an arcane amulet around your neck.

What are you then?<br/><b>Razor</b>: Nothing?<br/><b>Luke</b>: You gotta be something.<br/><b>Luke</b>: You ain\u2019t nothing until you\u2019re dead, mad or lost.<br/><b>Razor</b>: Well I lost my rootless wanderer aspect when I vomited it out of my guts<br/><b>Luke</b>: True<br/><b>Luke</b>: So you\u2019re just back to being a plain old hero? a sick, poisoned hero?<br/><b>Razor</b>: I think so! You tell me.<br/><b>Luke</b>: Well, you\u2019re the hero player. I\u2019m the narrator. It\u2019s your job to be the hero. It\u2019s my job to challenge you.<br/>12:44 PM<br/><b>Razor</b>: I didn\u2019t choose to lose my rootless wanderer aspect! Sick, poisoned hero works for me. But I was under the impression that I lost my rootless wanderer guts for good. So if I heal up, I\u2019ll just be a plain old hero. That\u2019ll be a pretty powerful search aspect in Google.<br/><b>Luke</b>: Interesting. Well, we haven\u2019t come to \u201chealing\u201d rules yet, so we can deal with it when we do. If we do!<br/><b>Luke</b>: Muahhahahh<br/><b>Luke</b>: So<br/><b>Razor</b>: Yes<br/><b>Luke</b>: You are a sick, poisoned hero wearing demon\u2019s skin boots and bearing an arcane amulet around your neck. You are currently vomiting bile and blood as you dangle by your feet over the odiferous maw of a Possessed Otyugh. You are dangling over a pit of filth in the center of a ruined, sunken temple. Tallow lantern light gutters around you. Two cultists transformed into ghouls tittering with anticipation, awaiting your destruction. The Otyugh, however, believes that if he should destroy you, he will be confronted with the God of Gods.<br/><b>Luke</b>: What do you do?<br/><b>Razor</b>: I tell him to let me go, and kick him with my demon\u2019s skin boots!<br/><b>Luke</b>: He burbles, \u201cIWILLNOTRELEASEYOUUNTILYOUPRESENTTHISGODOFGODSTOME.\u201d You think he\u2019s laughing through the burbling, but trying to conceal it.<br/><b>Razor</b>: I shout, \u201cThe God of Gods will not come unless he is Pleased or Angry!\u201d<br/><b>Luke</b>: (If you want a talk challenge, you\u2019re going to have to initiate it.

Demon\u2019s skin boots beat the Otyugh Tentacles. Tell me how.<br/><b>Razor</b>: The evil sensors in the Demon\u2019s skin boots have been heating up throughout the entire exchange and have finally reached their critical temperature. They begin to burn through the Otyugh Tentacle skin. He coils in pain just long enough to drop me from his grip.<br/><b>Luke</b>: Brilliant.

I don\u2019t trust him because I don\u2019t trust the Otyugh.<br/><b>Luke</b>: What aspect are you using?<br/><b>Luke</b>: Your boots, I guess?<br/><b>Razor</b>: No, I just got a shovel!<br/><b>Luke</b>: ::stunned silence::<br/><b>Luke</b>: ::hysterical laughter::<br/><b>Luke</b>: I literally can\u2019t stop laughing.<br/><b>Razor</b>: ::sheepish::<br/><b>Luke</b>: Okay, you have a rusted, bent shovel<br/><b>Luke</b>: I am a ghoul cultist and I\u2019m going to kick your ass<br/><b>Razor</b>: ::regret::<br/><b>Razor</b>: Go!<br/><b>Luke</b>: 2,360,000<br/><b>Razor</b>: I think it might be over for me.<br/><b>Luke</b>: That\u2019s much higher than the search terms for me yesterday<br/><b>Razor</b>: 551,000<br/><b>Luke</b>: The ghoul firmly takes the shovel from your hands and leads you back over to the trash pile. As you climb atop, you see the other ghoul huffing and covered in slime, shoveling garbage down to the insatiable Otyugh.

The ghoul has taken away your rusted, bent shovel.<br/><b>Razor</b>: I search the garbage pile.<br/><b>Luke</b>: For what are you searching?<br/><b>Razor</b>: I\u2019m searching for anything holy, evil, or valuable to use to help myself. My years of rootless wandering has taught me to always search before I act. The Otyugh seems to have a taste for powerful consumables.<br/><b>Luke</b>: With what are you searching?<br/><b>Razor</b>: My demon\u2019s boots!<br/><b>Luke</b>: You\u2019re taking quite a risk here.<br/><b>Luke</b>: If you lose, you\u2019re down to your goblet of anise, rue and horehound mixed in milk.<br/><b>Razor</b>: I\u2019m going to lose my boots?<br/><b>Luke</b>: Definitely!<br/><b>Razor</b>: Would I just like, find something I don\u2019t want?

Hrm.<br/><b>Luke</b>: Are you searching the pile?<br/><b>Razor</b>: You\u2019re going to win, with offal and refuse. No.<br/><b>Luke</b>: Madame, I am merely the narrator of your story.<br/><b>Razor</b>: I begin shoveling trash down into the pile. While I do so, I talk to the slimy ghoul. \u201cGhoul\u201d, I say, \u201cTell me where you came from.\u201d<br/><b>Luke</b>: His dead, soulless eyes briefly light, \u201cI was flesh and blood, once, like you. We belonged to a mystery cult. We met secretly here in this temple. The cult promised knowledge and eternal life, but it was all lies. My brother and I found the seedling of this creature. We stole the priest\u2019s books and performed a ritual upon it. Thus was born the God. It has granted us eternal life...though in exchange for eternal service.\u201d<br/><b>Razor</b>: \u201cIs there a ritual to reverse the curse?\u201d<br/><b>Luke</b>: He looks dumbly at you, as if to say, \u201cWhy would one want to do such a thing?\u201d<br/><b>Razor</b>: \u201cWhere is the Priest now?\u201d<br/>3:00 PM<br/><b>Luke</b>: \u201cHe would not join us, you understand...He came to no harm.

I thought that\u2019s what we decided<br/><b>Luke</b>: You lost your rootless wanderer aspect to the stench. You don\u2019t gain a more powerful aspect because of that. If that\u2019s the case, then there\u2019s never been any risk of you losing.<br/><b>Razor</b>: I didn\u2019t realize how powerful it was until I just googled it<br/><b>Razor</b>: Okay. Fine.<br/><b>Luke</b>: I\u2019m glad you agree.<br/><b>Razor</b>: alright, I use \u201cdemon\u2019s skin boots.\u201d<br/><b>Luke</b>: How are your demon\u2019s skin boots going to help you in this talk challenge?<br/><b>Razor</b>: We used to roll and then describe. Not complaining, just mentioning the change.<br/><b>Luke</b>: I\u2019m not asking for a description of your success. I\u2019m trying to understand what exactly your hero is doing as he attempts to convince a ghoul cultist with his demon\u2019s skin boots.<br/><b>Razor</b>: My boots will exude a heat as they sense the ghoul\u2019s knowledge of such a powerful evil. This warmth will help convince the ghoul to give me the information.<br/><b>Luke</b>: The ghoul cultist obfuscates.<br/><b>Luke</b>: Yeesh: 12,500.<br/><b>Razor</b>: what did you search? ghoul cultist again?<br/><b>Razor</b>: 610,000<br/><b>Luke</b>: \u201cGhoul cultist obfuscates\u201d<br/><b>Luke</b>: Your imminently useful demon\u2019s skin boots bring the glowing realization that you are standing atop the cult\u2019s repository of knowledge.<br/><b>Razor</b>: I would like to drink my potion.<br/><b>Luke</b>: To what effect?<br/><b>Razor</b>: An improvise challenge?

For a moment it seems like you\u2019re going to keep it down, but you inadvertently inhale the putrid fumes of the otyugh as you try to settle your stomach. And you explosively vomit the healing mixture all over the refuse pile. Overcome, you swoon from weakness.<br/><b>Luke</b>: You awake a moment later to find yourself in the Otyugh\u2019s pit.

How do you improvise?<br/><b>Razor</b>: I use my demon boots to cling to the tenticles and scale them to the top of the pit.<br/><b>Luke</b>: Hm, I shall use slimy otyugh tentacles, then<br/><b>Razor</b>: 616,000<br/><b>Luke</b>: 1090.<br/><b>Razor</b>: heh<br/><b>Luke</b>: Your powerful demon\u2019s skin boots allow you to scale the unscaleable.

Have you done much chat- or email-based play before?<br/><br/>I like the breakdown between different mechanical challenges, but it doesn't seem to matter before you limit the amulet to specific kinds of challenges, otherwise they all resolve in the same manner, yeah?  It's interesting that you threw out that seed of an idea early on but it only came to fruition later.<br/><br/>In "Waiting/Tea" I talked about the different between "actions" and "expressions" in text-based games (including chat / email), where actions have mechanical significance (potentially changing the state of the game) and expressions are the flavorful descriptions and dialog that provide context for the actions.  It was interesting to see movement between distinct locations / rooms as being somewhere in the middle of an action and expression.  Like, when she's in the pit and has to use her boots to get out, movement is clearly an action. And movement definitely changes the options you are presented with or at least the sections of the fiction that you can engage mechanically.  But movement typically is just done, not resolved as a challenge, which makes me think that, in your game, you basically have three spheres of possible action as a player: challenges, movement, and then description (even though the description can also be broken into talk / search / etc.)<br/><br/>Question: the player often talks and searches without it necessarily being a challenge, yeah?  Can you ever fight or improvise without a challenge arising?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251282">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251282/#Comment_251282" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-18T13:06:46+00:00" title="January 18, 2010  1:06PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 18, 2010 1:47PM by Nathan_H.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Luke Wheel</cite>D/F/K?</blockquote>\nFMK?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251332/#Comment_251332" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-18T21:08:13+00:00" title="January 18, 2010  9:08PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero -- no need to make jargon even more obscure.

Find the first full word in the title that was not one of the search terms.* This word is the result.<br/>3) Compare resulting words, highest alphabetically sorted word wins.<br/>4) The next time you use that same search term, you must subtract the result word you got previously.<br/><br/>Example:<br/><br/>- Lucky search "arcane amulet" (without quotes).<br/>- At the moment, this returns a 404 page! So, with the title bar saying "404 - Not Found", the first full word is "not".<br/>- Next time, lucky search "arcane amulet -not".<br/>- Title is "Arcane Amulet of the Sun...", so word is "of".<br/>- Next time, lucky search "arcane amulet -of".<br/>- and so on.<br/><br/><br/>* If there is a found page that contains no qualifying result word, the player narrates something happening to the aspect that results in its search phrase changing. Ideally, the contents of the page that came up would color the result, somehow. As an example, maybe it becomes "blackened arcane amulet" because first thing the player notices about the page is that it is very dark, and narrates how, during the challenge, flesh seared against the amulet, leaving an oily residue. The new phrase is then lucky searched and that result is used for the current challenge. If, on the other hand, the search initially returns no results, then the same thing happens, but the GM chooses the narration and term alteration based on the result of his own test.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251645/#Comment_251645" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-20T16:36:14+00:00" title="January 20, 2010  4:36PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 20, 2010 4:37PM by sage.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have no inside knowledge on this, but I wouldn't be too surprised if repeated searches can effect the result as more pages are indexed for that term and the estimated number of results becomes more exact.
