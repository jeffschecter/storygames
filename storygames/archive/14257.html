Sometime soon, it is my task to organize a game of Faery's Tale (Deluxe, if it matters) for my three nieces, aged 11, 9, and 7, and nephew aged...um, either 4 or 5. I know he's on the cusp, anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't think I'll have any problems with imagination, as they are chock full. After a brief explanation of the four types, the boy for example has exclaimed that he wants to be a Sprite named Jake, who has a blue mohawk and rides a squirrel. The eldest girl has decided to be a Pixie with leaves for wings named Isabelle. Obviously, these kids are awesome.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what I'm looking for here is anyone with experience running the game, either with adults or kids, and any tips you might have for me that I may be overlooking. Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323574/#Comment_323574" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-09T10:34:52+00:00" title="May  9, 2011 10:34AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I will have to think about it, but one suggestion I would make is to give them a villain they can't just fight... Like a giant who is too big to notice them, even if they take a swing at him. The reason I suggest this is, if the five year old is like my guy of the same age, his solution to everything is to bash it. Give them a reason to think of something more clever, a reason to negotiate or to do something prank-like, and then let the idea work, but maybe not in the way they expected. Once they get into it, the narration will kind of feed itself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323584/#Comment_323584" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-09T11:28:39+00:00" title="May  9, 2011 11:28AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've only played it with my daughter when she was 4 and 5 - which means she's a completely different sort of person from a 6-9 who again is completely different from 11.  Might get crazy having all those age ranges at once!<br/><br/>My daughter absolutely needed it to be diceless when the stakes mattered. She wouldn't even roll the dice if there was a possibility of failure. But if her attribute was simply lower than her opponent and I said, "You won't be able to outrace him, he's too fast" or whatever, that was fine. And if it was just a tournament she was playing in, rolling dice to see who won the game of hide-and-seek or whatever was fine. You might have the same issues with the nephew - you might ask the other kids if they're okay with the nephew not rolling dice. Or maybe he has thicker skin than my daughter.<br/><br/>My daughter also went off the rails. "Okay, so the frog prince wants your help. Will you help him?" "No." My solution was to let her - "Okay, he goes away, sad" - and then pull another scenario from the booklet and run with that. It made things sort of sandboxy - she could pursue a mission or not. And, maybe this is me being a little too harsh, but when she didn't pursue a mission there would be consequences. The princess married an evil prince instead of the frog prince and the evil prince had a vendetta against the fairies (some of my favorite sessions came out of that) ... or the fairy queen is upset with her for disobeying. Also, did a lot of "Yes, and" - she wanted a cat friend and the cat friend would get new powers every session. Awesome creativity and I let her go with it. <br/><br/>Also, we drew the map of the fairyland and neighboring kingdoms together. Automatic fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323623/#Comment_323623" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-09T15:03:31+00:00" title="May  9, 2011  3:03PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I've been mulling it over, and it seems like most people run this for one or two kids at a time. It may be hard to make sure they each get their fair share of spotlight time, success, failure, and redemption...with four of them at once, I mean. Yeah, I may have Jake's player run it diceless, but I suspect he'll at least want to roll dice, as that's the tactile aspect of the game, once he sees his sisters excitedly rolling and reading dice results.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323632/#Comment_323632" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-09T15:54:37+00:00" title="May  9, 2011  3:54PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My guess is that the 9 and 11 year olds will be OK with a reasonable amount of non-focus time, but the younger ones may want to be in focus a lot.<br/><br/>One possible solution - pair up an older one with a younger one, putting the younger one in the more "in charge" role. Like have the 11 year old play a character who is assigned to guard and protect the 5 year old. And have the 9 year old paired up with the 7 year old.<br/><br/>You'll have to feel it out and see if that seems to deprotagonizing for the older girls. But it might help.<br/><br/>My 10 year old son is playing in a game with 6 of my adult friends. There's too many players, but most of the time he's ok with having a fairly big chunk of time where he's not in focus. So 4 kids may work out OK. But I think pairing them up might be helpful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323634">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323634/#Comment_323634" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-09T15:59:50+00:00" title="May  9, 2011  3:59PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Huh.

If you take a look at the credits, you'll see my name in there. <br/><br/>One of the important things I learned is to keep the adventures fairly short for the young ones, somewhere about half an hour. The seems to be the squirm point for most 4-5year olds. Also, do not play in an environment with a lot of potential distractions. If you are in a room with toys in it, they will want to play with them when they are not in the spotlight.<br/><br/>Unless their parents are also playing, playing with children is a lot like herding cats. They haven't learned much in the way of social skills, and they may not see the GM as an authority figure. Keep the group small and/or get the parents to play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323853/#Comment_323853" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-10T20:59:53+00:00" title="May 10, 2011  8:59PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another very good point. <br/>\n<br/>\nAdditionally, I just had what I think will be a very cool idea!
