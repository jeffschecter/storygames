I think one of the more important skills a Ganakagok GM needs to possess is the ability to figure out which PCs are internally motivated by their characters' back stories and which need the GM to provide a powerful external motivating force, and so to be hands-off in one case and very hands-on in the other. Additionally, it's important to push for "the crux" -- the point of the individual character's turn where it's apparent that the game needs "to go to the mechanics," which are really just a formal structure for participating in the narrative and allocating game-mechanical consequences. I often try to work it so that the first player's turn moves very rapidly from the start of the turn to the crux, so that players can see that fiction doesn't stop when the mechanics are being used, but rather continues in a very consequential way.<br/><br/>The rules as written are agnostic as to "sessions," but five or six hours strikes me as about right, including 1 to 1-1/2 hours of in-play setting and character generation. According to the rules as written, the end-game gets closer and closer as a particular in-game currency ("Stars in the Night Sky") counts down as a game-mechanical result of a certain kind of player decision, In practice, it's often easier to tie the end-game to the real-world clock, and just say that Dawn comes (and the game ends) 15 minutes before the end of the slot, leaving enough time for narrating "final fates" and ending the game. I've seen Nick Wedig do it that way, and it seems to work well. Another way of doing it is just to say, "we're going to go around the table once [with 4 or 5 players, say] or twice [with 2 or 3] and give everyone a turn."<br/><br/>I think Jason is right that there's some self-selection going on in terms of liking the game; it isn't universally appealing or always successful, and it takes some skill to run and to play -- although a skillful enough GM can facilitate good play from novices. One very early game that I ran had two teenage D&amp;D players who played out a very nice story in which one of them became the voice of the Sun and the other led the People into icy caves to hide from the Sun, and their final confrontation was a debate that the Sun's advocate lost, leaving the People to shiver in the cold darkness while outside the Sun shone on a new people. Sad and lovely! And I'm sure there are degenerate strategies that make it possible to "win" mathematically and overwhelm the fiction, which is unfun for others to be sure. But with a good group it is <i>absolutely fantastic</i> and really memorable. The last game I ran was at Origins, and you can see at least two of those players saying that the "one cool thing" they saw there was the other players playing the game. And I <i>always</i> feel that way when I run the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340952/#Comment_340952" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-30T10:52:40+00:00" title="August 30, 2011 10:52AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My girlfriend is a self-identified "non-gamer" and this is her favorite game ever.<br/><br/>She says that using the cards to frame scenes and conflicts helps her a great deal, because she doesn't see herself as creative enough on her own.  So being able to frame a vague idea with some given imagery or context helps her a great deal.<br/><br/>She also loves that pretty much everyone gets involved in conflict resolution, but that it's really about the <i>characters'</i> involvement, rather than the players' involvement.  It helped her get a better feel for her character and have a good time.<br/><br/>Also, maps are a great deal of fun.  At conventions, I usually bring butcher paper and a paintbrush.  When someone wants to add to the map, I make them add it to the map.  It winds up looking a bit more sumi-e than Nitu, but the feeling is the same.<br/><br/>The initial mapping/relationships/star calculation can take time, which is the only drawback for me.  Sometimes, when I try to run it for new people, I feel like they're loosing interest, and I want to jump forward to the actual play to show how it works.  In the end, all that planning is WAY worth it, but sometimes, a half-built set-up, or a FIRM GM hand of guidance is very very useful.<br/><br/>The shuffling of the dice can be really hard to understand sometimes.  Some players over-analyze what's going on, I think.  When I get a chance to play, I let my character's actions go, and just trust the game engine judge and reward the character.  I'm certainly not saying that this is the "best" way to play, but it's my preferred way, because I've noticed that once one player starts agonizing over where each and every pip goes, other players will follow suit, and the game can slow down.<br/><br/>Overall, I like it a lot, and I'll be running it by request as a pick-up game this weekend.  It continues to be quite popular and easy to play.<br/><br/>Hope this helps.<br/><br/>P.S. I love the stars as the pacing mechanic.

The rules also talk about other alternate pacing mechanisms, essentially telling the GM to feel his or her way to the end of the game. Good Medicine and Bad Medicine I leave alone, since those random initial dispositions of game-mechanical karma are part of the point of the game\n<blockquote>So, number of players is a big factor.
