Do you guys have others? <br/>\n<br/>\nRules Lawyer: Will stop a game just to look up a rule or more importantly play the "it's covered in the rules this way" during a session. Even if it breaks the flow of a game.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwink/MinMaxer: Used the rules to maximize effectiveness of character for game mechanic's reasons. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Book: The one player you can reliably expect not only know what the rule is but where to find it if she doesn't know the exact details of the rule. Usually has her role-playing book with little tabs all over it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFudgemister: The player who doesn't trust the GM to be fair with the game. Will fudge his dice, use his outside game knowledge either subtly or not to keep his character alive.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe RPist: Will play the character's flaws to the detriment of himself and the story line. Doesn't mind a good death for his character and enjoys the hell out of getting work form his GM to make the story move forward.<br/>\n<br/>\nTag-along: Comes to games cause its "cool" but falls asleep during the session, has to be woken up for either combats or anything special.<br/>\n<br/>\nSide-traker: That guy who's read all the source books and novels and then cuts in with "Wouldn't it be cool if Bla came in." Or "Bla Bla has this...." and you spend the next 10 minutes wanting them to be quite so you can get on with the game. (These ones annoy me most of all.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_372100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/1of3" title="1of3"><img alt="1of3" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/1of3">1of3</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372100/#Comment_372100" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-10T08:57:32+00:00" title="April 10, 2012  8:57AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Players who play anything the book says is rare in the setting.<br/><br/>Players who do not quite understand the rules, but still love that particular game.<br/><br/>Players who favor a particular campaign setting, then do not use anything official from the setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SavageHominid" title="SavageHominid"><img alt="SavageHominid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SavageHominid">SavageHominid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372130/#Comment_372130" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-10T11:14:33+00:00" title="April 10, 2012 11:14AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Silly Hat: A player who throws on a character voice, and does a lot of "roleplaying" but will actually avoid making any choices unless they are given a "safe plot option" by the GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_372146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372146/#Comment_372146" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-10T12:02:21+00:00" title="April 10, 2012 12:02PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How about the guy who picks up the beautifully painted miniatures and starts bashes them together simulating combat ! joking here but....<br/>\n<br/>\nafter we have identified all these types of players could we categorised them too?<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm interested in getting player and players ( The playing group ) aware of types.

Not that I am against splitting hairs, that can be fun and interesting too.<br>\n<br>\nOk going into thinking out loud in type mode:<br>\n<br>\nYou do pose some interesting questions and suggestions, Player medium of play (PMoP), cause I am not typing that again, suggests that players are either aware enough to change tactics during play or can modify their needs long enough to keep a game flowing. (Not always true, from my experiences) I think that might be asking a bit much for a human being to step too far outside their comfort zone and move whole zones... <br>\n<br>\nMaybe the player could conceivably move closer to another quadrant of play long enough to enable another player to control/move the story/game forward? <br/>\n<br/>\nThat brings in the group dynamics part of roleplaying where people suspend their need for the greater enjoyment of the game? (again not always true from personal experience)<br/>\n<br/>\nSide Note: Thinking of a player in the grid you could have people who can only play one zone as well as players who are so close to seam of two zones that they could move fairly easily between zones. I would be interested in seeing the spread of a whole community of players.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill there should be a default PMoP that players prefer or stick close to. (I am going to have a little side project in watching my player cohort for this dynamic change during a game to see if I can catch it happening.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to how to handle such lack of control in the PMoP, I suspect that would come down to what type of person they are...<br/>\n<br/>\nBut a GM who's aware of his/her players being like this could cater better to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far you are making sense, ha!<br/>\n<br/>\n1of3,<br/>\nOk then Exoticist it is.

The vast majority of the negative behaviors you've identified in this thread represent players frustrated with a lack of opportunity to satisfy these motives productively.<br><br>(Note: This list was developed primarily through observing live combat larp players, which is why you have things like Exercise in the list. But it works well for tabletop if you allow for that.)<br><br>Motives:<br>Audience - Experience a satisfying narrative<br>Catharsis - Experience emotions through the character<br/>Comprehension - Figure things out. Solve problems and puzzles.<br/>Competition - Win at something, or at least enjoy the act of competing.<br/>Crafting - Create non-ephemeral things (costumes, props, documents, etc.)<br/>Education - Take away new knowledge or understanding as a player.<br/>Embodiment - Make decisions based on character background, knowledge, and motivation.<br/>Exercise - Enjoy physical activity and movement.<br/>Exploration - Experience the fictional setting.<br/>Exhibition - Show off (costumes, props, acting chops, mad skillz, etc.) and get kudos.<br/>Fellowship - Enjoy time with friends (also includes flirting and such).<br/>Flow - Enjoy losing oneself in the moment.<br/>Leadership - Be important to the player community.<br/>Protagonist - Be important to the story and impact the game world.<br/>Spectacle - Experience the awesome stuff (pretty costumes, elaborate sets, funny NPCs, etc.)<br/>Versatility - Collect important things (spells, lore, favors, etc.) and have the right thing at the right time.<br/><br/><br/>I think recognizing that players have these desires, and that they are perfectly reasonable things to want out of a game experience, can lead to a productive discussion with your players. They can also be used to identify what players are looking for and guide session planning.<br/><br/>These are the short versions of the motive descriptions.

Then we can discuss why and where of the placements.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso getting out side your comfort zone isn't atypical of roleplayers, I do agree you should because it makes for interesting gaming....but not everyone is capable of that. I think this is why we have power gamers, they use that rule book like a demon possessed to maximize their comfort zone. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don't think it means you can't be a balanced roleplayer because your not outside the rule book, I do think it might be a bit repetitive...after a while. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhich bring me to the "One Trick Pony" Player, only one style of character, they can but don't play the others types of characters. I don't see them not making the game interesting but they are very reliable in their out comes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRob, <br/>\n<br/>\nMight need to read your 20 pages to wrap my head round your motives. Though shouldn't be too hard to map them to the grid with the other player labels. <br/>\nStill you could probably fit the labels in your listing as well...I haven't really been focusing on what motivates these people yet, just identifying them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't know if LARP and tabletop have the same equivalency remembering that LARPers usually are more out going, thus the costumes and physical locations thing. Tabletop more in your head don't always include being in the physical location and not normally wearing gear.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI would see that even though they do have very similar requirements, Tabletop lacks the Motivators: Exercise, Exhibition, Spectacle, Crafting as tactile part of their game set. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll of the data you present does come into use after the fact of the labels, what motives these player labeled people to do what they do, but I feel that maybe your one step ahead of what I am looking for currently. And once we have, as Paul suggests, the chart maybe we could marry up your motivations to the labels?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways that's all I have right  now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alejandro_Etsu" title="Alejandro_Etsu"><img alt="Alejandro_Etsu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i28.tinypic.com/2uqiyv8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alejandro_Etsu">Alejandro_Etsu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372648/#Comment_372648" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-13T01:51:56+00:00" title="April 13, 2012  1:51AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 13, 2012 1:58AM by Alejandro_Etsu.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>I think it's far more useful to classify <i>behaviours</i> rather than people.<br/><br/>People are complex, changeable, and diverse.

I find these classifications even offensive and unhelpful.<br/><br/>I once played with a friend who tried everything to keep his character safe.

Playing a kind of Call of Cthulhu hack, he would not go out to investigate, because being a horror game If you investigate you die. (He had never played Cthulhu or any similar game before. He was not a roleplayer.) Then we change to Trial of Cthulhu... And immediately he became the leader of the group, making all the decisions, and risking his character life to advance the investigation. It was awesome.

Hope you people have a good imagination.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst things first the two outliers: <br/>\nTag-along: Needs more sleep could be anyone of the quadrants<br/>\nOne Trick Pony: Could be anyone of the quadrants<br/>\n<br/>\nI really didn't want to draw in a new circle set round the grid for those two.<br/>\nI'd like to point out here that will be giving my reasoning for each location as we go.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk so lets move round the grid from Combat Focused through Power Gamer to Tactical Focused<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Hulk (aka combat wombat) I place this player close to the Combat Focused line but deep in the  power game quadrant. Most Hulks need to have a good level of knowledge about the game while still being able to focus on powering up the characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Book moving closer to the middle of the arc through Power Gamers, but close into inner circle of  where it's less difficult for people to make the move over the line of gaming. I place the book here because usually these players tend to be more about the game overall, trying to make the game flow fast and by the rule. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Noble Politician, moving deeper into the grid of power gamers  but almost in line on the same arc with the Book is where I think you'd find the Politician, They are more selfish about their motives of power gaming. The rules are there to benefit them. <br/>\n<br/>\nRules Lawyer, continuing down closer to the Tactical Focused line you'll find the Rules Lawyer,  pretty much below the Politician. These players tend to want to play the game fairly at an individual level, this means if it good for them it's good for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Line of Tactical Focused:<br/>\nWelcome to Fudgemister land, a place where balance is important. If this player feels you are putting them at a tactical disadvantage and doesn't trust you to be fair they will use their considerable knowledge of the game and skills as a character actor to fix this issue <br/>\n<br/>\nSide-traker, Moving from Tactical Focused towards the Story Focused just outside the white circle maybe about  4 o'clock  is our Side-tracker, using his character actor skill to opportunistically stop the flow of the game giving them either time or just to derail the play the game dynamics change or stop.<br/>\n<br/>\nExoticist, deep deep in the far right hand corner is the Exoticist, someone who's whole play is based deeply in their enjoyment of Character Acting. This can be detrimental storyline if the player doesn't account for everyone else. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Rpist, crossing the line of Story Focused into Storytellers we find the Rpist at about 7 o'clock about halfway down the grid. Plays the game for the story now always versatile enough deep play a character but understands the need for their play to move with the story.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Scene Maker, deep in the Storytellers about 8 o'clock is the Scene Maker with a good balance  of Strategic and Story focus to ensure very memorable scenes, though sometimes not rules consistent.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Martyr moving close to the Strategic Focus line half way from the edge of the grid and the white inner circle you find the Martyr, a player willing to sacrifice for the over aching storyline and giving the players enjoyment as well as themselves. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Improviser found in the inner circle very close to the Strategic Focused line so close that they can easily move over the lines to be what is needed for the game. <br/>\n<br/>\nMoving over the Strategic Focused line into the Thinkers we find The Challenger not too far mirrored from the Martyr. With a deep understanding of the game and loads of thought the Challenger bring his vision of the role-playing games base premise to the story.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwink/MinMaxer, last but not least on my little list sitting in the centre of the Thinkers grid is the Twink, master of his math, and games rules that are so grey they can use them to get the maximum out of their characters. <br/>\n<br/>\nOk that's it, if you disagree let me know, or want clarification.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372855/#Comment_372855" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-14T11:40:45+00:00" title="April 14, 2012 11:40AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>What's a problematic behaviour you've noticed?</b><br/>\n<br/>\nOk back at me :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree instead of using the label Player we should use behaviour.<br/>\nI have noticed the <b>problematic behaviour</b> from nightweave's list and could imagine the one's I haven't, But....<br/>\nIts not really the behaviour thats the problem its the control of that behaviour.<br/>\nThe awareness of it blowing up, getting inflated and taking up more space in the game then anything else.<br/>\nThe player caught in his moment of bookishness for example, is oblivious to the players rolling their eyes, and the eye rollers are unaware of the repetitive long term effects of eyerolling :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm trying to make light of this.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo once we have a definitive list of negative behaviour and possible positive with motives <b>( Rob  quote# 17 These are the short versions of the motive descriptions.

Don't get me wrong I know loads of people who don't like being put in a box, or labelled, or even having been classified, the aim here is to get a level playing field for the basic types of play out there.

What effect GM story telling can do to help or hinder these player styles.<br>\n<br>\nI am starting with a player focus because it's always about the players, their enjoyment, their play, their story. <br>\n<br>\nPaul88,<br>\n<br>\nMore eloquently put than I'll ever be able to do. The aim: Define issue, look for fixes, or work arounds, enhancements and rewards. <br>\n<br>\nAgreed there should be more threads about deflating unwanted behaviour and building more constructive behaviour in games, I know this might not interest some people as they are lucky enough to have players that don't cause problems, I am not that lucky. That is why I am working on this, and still we need a set of language we can use to stay on track, that is my aim here.<br>\n<br/>\nOn a side note:<br/>\nAh the Exoticist, one of the more rare player types, I think this is more of a phase most players go through, when they are younger (read experienced wise in game) and the exotic nature of the character types has that shiny allure of coolness and we forgot about the playability of the character in a group setting.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372930/#Comment_372930" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-15T08:23:41+00:00" title="April 15, 2012  8:23AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 15, 2012 8:25AM by Paul88.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was thinking we could try a bit of humour here and put some behaviour to video, here's a few I have found<br/>\n<br/>\nVentriloquist or ventriloquism behaviour....

"Take out that bunker before the machine gun kills us all!" is Tactical.<br/>\n<b>The vertical axis is Combat Focused to Story Focused.</b><br/>\n"Combat Focused" means "Conflict resolution is interesting to me." "Story Focused" means "The world and the interaction of the characters is intersting to me."<br/>\n"Kick this door down and kill anything that moves" is Combat focused. "This door has the Mark of Malvena; the space within should be safe for us to rest in" is Story focused.<br/>\nThis creates four quadrents. Starting in the upper left and moving clockwise, label these quadrents <b>Thinkers, Power Gamers, Character Actors</b>, and<b>Storytellers</b><br/>\n<br/>\n<b>A Thinker</b><br/>\nIs a player who most enjoys the game when it delivers Strategic/Combat Focus. This kind of person is likely to enjoy min-maxing a character, spending hours out of game to find every conceivable advantage available in the system to deliver maximum damage from behind maximum protection, even if the min-maxing produces results that are seemingly illogical/impossible. This kind of person wants to solve puzzles and can keep track of long chains of facts and clues.<br/>\n<b>A Power Gamer</b><br/>\nIs a player who most enjoys the game when it delivers a Tactical/Combat Focus. This kind of person is likely to enjoy playing a character that has a minimum of personality (often, this kind of person plays a character that is simply an extension of the player). This kind of player enjoys short, intense gaming experiences. The consequences of a failed action are minimized for this player, who will roll up a new character and return to the fray without much thought for the storyline implications of that action.<br/>\n<b>Character Actor</b><br/>\nIs a player who most enjoys the game when it delivers a Tactical/Story Focus. This kind of person is likely to enjoy the act of theater; using voice, posture, props, etc. to express a character's actions and dialog. This player will have a character that makes sub-optimal choices (from an external perspective) to ensure that the character's actions are "correct" from the perspective of the character's motivations, ethics, and knowledge.<br/>\n<b>A Storyteller</b><br/>\nIs a player who most enjoys the game when it delivers a Strategic/Story Focus. This kind of person finds enjoyment from the logical progression of the narrative of the scenario. There should be a beginning, a middle and an end. Characters should develop over time in reaction to their experiences. This player will look for a non-rules answer to inconsistencies or anachronisms in the game experience.<br/>\nThere is a fifth type of player, who does not express a preference along any of the four axis. This person is a "basic roleplayer", who finds enjoyment from strategy, tactics, combat and story in rough equilibrium.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_373148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373148/#Comment_373148" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-16T18:44:27+00:00" title="April 16, 2012  6:44PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My article is in the 2011 WyrdCon Academic Book, found here:<br><br><a href="http://www.mortalisrpg.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mortalisrpg.com/</a><br><br>It's in the Downloads block on the left.

Sometimes others can see our motives more clearly than we can see in ourselves. <br><br>I can identify players for whom, for example, Exhibition is a huge motive. But because having such a motive is often considered vanity, society encourages people to not acknowledge and embrace the fact that they enjoy such things. And that is why I focus heavily on presenting all the motives in a positive manner. <br><br>All the motives, when channelled and encouraged properly, can bring TONS of good stuff to a game. I played a tabletop game with a player who loved to play characters with very specific accents and mannerisms, sometimes funny and sometimes serious, depending on the game. He played a troll decker in a Shadowrun game that used a speech mannerism based on the main character from Sling Blade and had his decking port hidden up his nose. I laughed so hard when he spoke that my sides hurt for days after we played. And we all had a great time. It's an excellent example of Exhibition being used to entertain the rest of the group. The player probably didn't consciously acknowledge that he was showing off his funny characterization and playing for laughs - he's a pretty humble guy and the idea of "showing off" would appall him. But by giving an appropriate amount of free reign for it to happen, the GM gave him the opportunity to satisfy his motive and gave the rest of the table the opportunity to be thoroughly entertained.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
