Admittedly, no one was in a particularly mathematical mood for that game, so I think the fact that it would be more cost-effective to only pay to invoke the Aspect AFTER the roll didn't really concern us.  If a conflict was really important (or if the player just felt like showing off), they'd invoke Aspects and pay for them before they even picked up the dice, and everyone would laugh and cheer and hope for a ridiculously high result.  And if an important roll went really badly, people scrambled to find Aspects to mitigate the damage, and that was also fun.<br/><br/>So at least one part of my answer to your question would be to say that yes, you absolutely can let people invoke Aspects before their rolls without breaking the game; I've seen it done, it worked fine.  You don't even have to make it mechanically different from invoking after the roll, you just have to...er...let people do it.<br/><br/>But I think that answer may be missing your point, which leads me to ask: what kind of change do you want?  Would you be happy with players sometimes invoking Aspects before rolling the dice out of sheer enthusiasm, or do you want them to always invoke the Aspect first and therefore need to find an incentive to make it a better choice than waiting until after the dice have come up short?<br/><br/>FWIW, I think that your idea of making a mechanical distinction between the two isn't necessarily terrible, but it does seem to undermine one of the best things about Aspects: the way they can take a lot of the gamble out of rolling the dice.  A +2 bonus means a lot, and knowing that you can fall back on an Aspect if the dice don't go your way and thereby snatch victory from the jaws of defeat (or at least mild injury from the jaws of unconsciousness) is cool.  Cutting that safety net isn't something I'd do lightly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284393/#Comment_284393" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-05T07:35:52+00:00" title="August  5, 2010  7:35AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JB Bell, one of our more shouty players, voiced the idea that FATE play is not really about influencing the roll but rather about rolling to set the real odds and then using Aspects to show how badly (or not) you want success. That is, the mechanism isn't really about random success but about setting a price tag to pay. I think that's pretty insightful and tinkering with FATE starts there for me.<br/><br/>This leads inevitably to the idea that the narrative surrounding the use of Aspects needs a very flexible timeline -- the table timeline and the narrative timeline do not necessarily correlate at all. Narrating an Aspect use as preparation you made last month is kosher. So is implying the pain you will feel tomorrow.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'd never lay down the law on this. Tag Aspects whenever it feels like a good idea -- the game won't break no matter when you do it. Hell I'd seriously consider a variant where you tag an Aspect at the beginning of the session and use the bonus somewhere near the end.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284424/#Comment_284424" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-05T10:47:41+00:00" title="August  5, 2010 10:47AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The mathematical changes between permitting people to do something before or after they roll is enormous, and often <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem" rel="nofollow">ridiculously nonintuitive</a>.  It's also (speaking generally here and not specifically about Aspects) one of the most-house-ruled, or perhaps least-enforced sort of rules I've ever seen with gaming groups. I think to some degree people say "Ugh, it's lame that they're not allowed to do X because they forgot to declare it before their roll" and leave it at that.

So, I'm really digging on this whole thing about how mechanics and the fiction interact.  In practice that means how the mechanics facilitate communication among the players about what's going on in their personal understanding of the imagined events.  So what bugs me about Aspects (and a lot of post-resolution modifiers) is that the fiction stops moving (i.e. communication stops happening).<br/><br/>What tends to happen is the player announces an action like, "I raise my sword, anger in my eyes, and strike him down with a clean cut."  The dice are rolled.  It doesn't go well.  The player then starts chucking FATE points while reading off a list of Aspects, "Swordman of the Holy Cross", "My True Love Is In Danger", "Rainy Weather", etc.  Meanwhile the *image* in my head hasn't changed at all.  It hasn't moved since that initial description.  I see that all those things are relevant because of my co-author relationship.  I have all the "meta" information necessary to understand their relevance to the scene.  However, the player doesn't communicate to me what the director/cinematographer/comic artist what have you is adding to the scene that would communicate those things to the *audience.*  The audience part of my participation isn't being satisfied.<br/><br/>Sometimes, if I'm feeling bold, I'll say something like, "And what does the audience see on the movie screen that lets them know that" or "How does the Rainy Weather work to your advantage, visually speaking" or something like that.  But having to step in and interject that all the time gets exhausting.<br/><br/>This isn't wholly unique to post-roll mechanics.  Application of Traits of PtA have the same problem and so do Helping Dice and FoRKs in Burning Wheel.  Both of which are pre-roll modifiers.  The difference, for me, however, is that once the dice hit the table the emotional impact of the result feeds immediately back into the discussion and the fiction starts moving again right away.  The "dead space" of mumbled intellectually understood (rather than emotionally felt) modifiers is at least shuffled away BEFORE the point of tension rather than after.  I still don't like it but it's better placed for me.<br/><br/>As an example of things that work for me I offer Dogs in the Vineyard and Sorcerer.  In Dogs in the Vineyard whatever dice you bring in have to be incorporated into your See or Raise.  They aren't modifiers at all.  They ARE your action.  Sorcerer has two basic dice tricks.  One is the chained victory dice which means bit of communicated fiction A has to flow into bit of communicated fiction B.  The other is the bonus dice which apply directly to the current action and are awarded by the GM.  That means, your right now, right here action has to be compellingly communicated otherwise the GM won't know to give you those dice.<br/><br/>I'm currently working on a game called Thornes (which about 80% a Sorcerer hack) and one my design rules is, "No self given awards."  Players can do things that make bonuses *available* but they can't actually receive the benefit of those bonuses unless another player chooses to "activate" that bonus and award it.  Initial play testing has revealed this to be extremely frustrating of the players.  I have yet to determine is that frustration is real "not fun" or more like exercise of atrophied muscles which can fucking painful until you get back in the swing of it.<br/><br/>Jesse<br/><br/>P.S. Oh and I completely agree with the JB Bell assertion above.  The more experience I have with FATE the more I think it's a resource management game where the die roll sets the minimum bid.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284466/#Comment_284466" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-05T12:36:52+00:00" title="August  5, 2010 12:36PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My own house rule for tagging aspects is:<br/>you can't get the bonus unless you narrate action that incorporates that bonus. An action is a flexible unit of time and expands and contracts as needed to fit the narrative, and one player's turn might have more action in it as a result, just like in movies where one person does much more when the spotlight is on him. <br/>So, basically, it works exactly like Dogs in the Vineyard raises. <br/><br/>it generates some interesting to-ing and fro-ing, if you and your opponent both spend aspects - you can respond to each other, and sometimes, one person's aspect is exactly the justification the other player uses to bring one of his aspects into the narrative.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284470">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284470/#Comment_284470" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-05T12:45:30+00:00" title="August  5, 2010 12:45PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: NomdePlume</cite>you can't get the bonus unless you narrate action that incorporates that bonus.</blockquote>\nThat's technically the rule for Helping Dice and FoRKs in Burning Wheel.  The problem is, you have to police it.  That gets exhausting.<br/><br/>You don't have to police it in Dogs because the other player literally can not respond with out the content of your See or Raise.  The game stops moving.  Burning Wheel doesn't stop moving if someone just hands over a die and says I'm helping with "Cartography" without saying anything more.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284476">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284476/#Comment_284476" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-05T12:57:02+00:00" title="August  5, 2010 12:57PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I didn't like the "auto-succeed-as-long-as-you-have-the-resources" thing about Fate back even before SotC came out (I was playing Fate 2.0 and then SotC the most before I actually got my physical copy of the book).  Some of my hacks then only allowed "personal" Aspects to be tagged before the role, allowing environmental or opponent Aspects to be used only after the roll, and then only for re-rolls rather than +2s.  Sort of my version of Diaspora's "scopes" before Diaspora.  My reasoning was you could always count on yourself if you committed to the task beforehand, but that things outside of yourself were less certain.  I also liked the narrative effect, where player describes their character's action along with how their "Defender of Xenopolis" Aspect applied, paid their Fate Point, rolled, and then had to decide whether to tag and pay for "The Temple's Aflame!" and how their actions continued on to take advantage of that Aspect.  And then if they rolled really poorly at that point the narration carried on in interesting ways unless they had some other external Aspect available for yet another re-roll.  I also felt it also allowed for more interesting decision-making following a roll than the default "+2 or re-roll for every Aspect at any time" which always has exactly one correct decision based on the math. <br/><br/>My later hacks had something very like scopes in response to the same issue where I didn't want people to be able to just always win when they had 10, or even 4, Fate Points.  Some of my other hacks "lock" rolls on any four of a kind so that four pluses, blanks, or minuses are your roll, AND tagged Aspects after that "locked" roll only grant a +1, period.  That also created some incentive to possibly pay some Fate Points ahead of the roll.<br/><br/>There are lots of reasons for doing it different ways depending on the nature of the game and on the preferences of the players.  There are surely better and worse choices but none of them break Fate.  It's very flexible that way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284545">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Carl" title="Carl"><img alt="Carl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Carl">Carl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284545/#Comment_284545" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-05T22:56:21+00:00" title="August  5, 2010 10:56PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>In Dogs in the Vineyard whatever dice you bring in have to be incorporated into your See or Raise.</blockquote>\nSuch is not actually the case.  When you bring in a trait or  belonging or relationship in a Raise or See you have to include it in the narration, but the actual dice rolled just go into your pool of dice available to use for Raises or Sees, and might or might not be used right away.<br/><br/>I like the idea of Aspects giving a +2 if tagged before and a reroll if tagged after, with player getting to choose which dice to reroll.  I'm not that fond of Aspects, but that's OK, lots of people do like them, so different gherkins for different gurkhas is fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
