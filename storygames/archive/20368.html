While they talk he glimpses out of the window (their apartment is on ground floor) <b><i>the face of an old man</i></b>, with grey ruffled hair and the mouth that silently opens and closes.<br/>But it's just a glimpse, the moment he focuses his attention on the window, the image is gone.<br/>"Maybe it was just the reflection of someone walking by... whatever."<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>Scene 2</i></span><br/>Next morning Rani is at his company's office to collect the details on the new job assignment and meet with Bernard Ulrich, his work partner. The office secretary hands him some documents with the technical data and the address and some pictures of the damage.<br/>One picture is weird: it shows the wreckage of a boiler and pipes among a lot of steam, and the steam kind of looks like <b><i>the face of the old man</i></b>!<br/>Nobody else seems to see a face in the spires of the steam, and Rani too can't see it anymore after passing the picture around. Must have been imagining things...<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>Scene 3</i></span><br/>Rani and Bernard get to the old part of the HafenCity dock area, where the building is located, and meet with Mr Levitt. He explains the situation and the accident and then leaves them to carry on the inspection. They are led to the main boiler room. The building has electricity and work-in-progress industrial lights, but in this one room some cable must be malfunctioning because it is pitch dark. And seen up close, with only the light of the heavy duty flashlights, <b><i>the boiler has a kind of foreboding look to it</i></b>. Also, Levitt explains, the accident is weird because the boiler was supposed to be off and not operational, yet something must have turned it on AND somehow clogged a pipe because there was a buildup of steam and hot water that eventually burst some pipes open, tearing them apart.<br/>While listening to this and looking at the damage, Rani feels <b><i>a strong sense of deja vu</i></b>, as if he had already been here, in the dark.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>Scene 4</i></span><br/>Still in the basement, Rani is now alone. Levitt went away and Bernard is checking the secondary boiler in an adjacent room. Suddenly there is a heavy <b><i>banging on the wall</i></b>, strong enough to have some dust fall from its bricks... like three slow thumps.<br/>Rani calls out "<i>Is this you Bernard? Is everything ok?</i>"<br/>No answer, then three more thumps.<br/>Rani shouts a louder call "<i>Bernard!</i>"<br/>And in that moment Bernard enters from the other door, perfectly clueless "<i>What? I'm here</i>".<br/>Rani "<i>Where you banging on the wall? I thought you needed help or, something</i>"<br/>Bernard "<i>I did bang on the wall with the flashlight, at some point, so yeah I guess it was me</i>"<br/>Rani "<i>But right now? a moment before you entered this room?</i>"<br/>Bernard "<i>I don't know, I guess, what's your point?</i>"<br/>Rani "<i>Err... no... nothing... nevermind</i>"<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>Scene 5</i></span><br/>Another day Rani is alone again, in one of the bathrooms from the third floor, checking the piping for signs of damage or clogs. Nothing much happens, but he is <b><i>feeling watched</i></b>, and the weirdest part is that the feeling kinda comes from the washbasin and toilet holes... it's as if <b><i>the pipes had eyes</i></b>... a stupid feeling he tried to shrug off.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>Scene 6</i></span><br/>A day later Rani and Bernard are meeting at the ground floor of the building to compare notes and findings. All looks fine, old and in need of renovations, but fine... the new owners might not need to change all the plumbing after all. Only problem is that they could not find the cause of the explosion, and until then the whole system is at risk.<br/>It's weird, <b><i>the accident makes no sense</i></b>, there are no signs of tampering, the boiler was definitely off, and yet it had steam into it, and obviously something that clogged the pipes, causing the explosion.<br/>Also, some pipes are not accounted for... you can see them enter the wall, but it is not clear where they exit, there are no sub-levels, and all other pipes have a clear entry and exit point.<br/>"<i>This is gonna take some time... and the boss is gonna pressure us for every extra day... shit!</i>"<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>Scene 7</i></span><br/>Rani is home again and is talking to Shireen about his work related frustrations.<br/>She asks him about the previous owners of the building, because maybe what they did might explain the boiler failing, maybe something stressed or corroded the pipes, or something.<br/>He now notices how he actually knows nothing about the building's history.<br/>The documents he has state that the past owner was a company stocking (fake?) persian carpets, but this is very recent, like 3 years in the past...<br/>Rani feels that there might be something wrong in the past of this building, and decides to dig deeper.<br/>He asks to Shireen to look online for any info, since she is so good with computers, and resolves to ask more info to his boss.<br/><br/><br/>- - -<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448686/#Comment_448686" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-22T16:46:50+00:00" title="September 22, 2015  4:46PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 24, 2015 3:00PM by Hasimir.">edited September 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CHAPTER TWO - Rumors</span></b><br/><b>Station</b> :  Hod<br/><b>Shadows</b> : <i>art, science, human craft</i><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>Scene 8</i></span><br/>Rani is at a nice cafeteria, meeting with Margaret.<br/>They are chatting about the current state of their lives and obviously Rani mentions his new job and the bad feeling that has started to creep on him since its beginning. When he mentions the building in which he is conducting the survey, Margaret declares that it sounds familiar. After checking online with her tablet she confirms it, that building has a bit of history to it, apparently there was some gossip about it in the late '40s, something about Nazis using it as a chemical facility or lab of some kind. Nothing creepy as the infamous "<i>Island of Orphans</i>" but still an interesting piece of Hamburg's past.<br/>This rubs Rani in the wrong way and he decides it is time to dig deeper; he asks Margaret if she can find out more, then resolves to also ask to his boss any info on previous owners of the building complex.<br/><br/>[<b>Note</b>: it is little known that in Hamburg there truly is a small island in the Elba river where there was a concentration camp (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuengamme_concentration_camp" rel="nofollow">Neuengamme</a>) particularly infamous because nazis performed tuberculosis-based experiments on the inmates, including more than 20 children]<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>Scene 9</i></span><br/>After work Rani went to the gym and now he is coming back home afterwards.<br/>It's night and he's walking through a park, as he does usually, but today he feels suddenly uneasy as if <b><i>being watched</i></b>. He starts accelerating his step, more and more until he breaks into a run. <br/>Getting scared while walking through a dark park is nothing extraordinary; but at that moment, while running, Rani felt again the <b><i>creepy sense of deja vu</i></b>, as if he had already been in this situation, running through a dark "forest" while being chased by something scary.<br/>But before he could really reflect on this he was out of the park, back into the city light and movement and life. Breathing heavily he looked back but there was nothing out of the ordinary.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>Scene 10</i></span><br/>Back home he chats with Shireen. He is under the shower, and she is in front of the computer.<br/>She found something about the building; various sources talk about it in relation to some sort of scandal... the place was used to either stock or produce medical supplies for the war effort, but some sources talk more specifically about human experimentation and toxic substances. Problem is, most of such "darker" sources seem not too reliable; one is what passed for a gossip magazine back in the '50s, others are little more than amateur websites a hair away from talking about aliens and conspiracies ... nothing that could be taken too seriously.<br/>Shireen "<i>So there you have it, chemical waste of some sort left to stew for 50 and more years; I'm no expert but that might have corroded the pipes or something, right?</i>"<br/>Rani "<i>Maybe, but there were no traces on site...</i>"<br/>Shireen "<i>Daah! Some new owner has to have cleaned up stuff at some point, I mean, we are talking some residue; you are really stressing out too much, this mystery is solved, cheer up!</i>"<br/>Rani "<i>I guess you are right...</i>"<br/><br/>[the <b>Menace</b> die advances enough to reach the Touched One on his Path, triggering a <i>Dark Moment</i>]<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>Scene 11 - Dark Moment</i></span><br/>Margareth is alone at home. It's night. She is comfortably sipping a hot soup in her dressing gown while looking at her computer.<br/>Someone knocks at the door; she goes to see, but there is no one there.<br/>Going back to her soup she glances at the window and sees the old man in the reflection, he is behind her! His face is fixed in a weird expression, with the mouth slowly opening and closing, as if he was unable to breath.<br/>Scared she turns to face the man and get away from him, but trips and falls to the ground. She suffers from asthma so she too grasps for air.<br/>The moment ends showing Margareth desperately clawing at the table to reach her inhaler while the old man walks towards her.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>Scene 12</i></span><br/>Rani is again in the boiler room, in the dark, alone.<br/>He knows something is wrong here, he KNOWS it.<br/>Feeling frustration he grabs a sledgehammer and starts lashing out at the metal carcass of the exploded boiler.<br/>The pounding makes the connected pipes vibrate, and this in turn shakes the bricks in the wall... and a couple fall down, revealing that the space around one of the "mismatching" pipes is not solid wall, but it is empty.<br/>Rani stops for a moment, then starts tearing down that section of the wall until he carves a man-sized passage out of it.<br/>His flashlight revealed a small interspace between the two boiler rooms.<br/>It was an empty space going down for a full 3 meters, practically a whole sub-level!<br/>And the mismatching pipe did not indeed come out from the other wall because it too curved downwards, where more unaccounted pipes could be seen.<br/>Rani felt feverish and without waiting to tell anyone started the climb down.<br/><br/>[here dice got rolled, and after an initial failure, Rani succeeded in climbing down without injuring himself... but at the cost of raising his Unease rating]<br/><br/>[the table also agreed that this might qualify as turning the Key for the end of the Chapter, but that actually entering and exploring the sub-level would have been a much more fitting Key]<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>Scene 13</i></span><br/>Down into the interspace, Rani started walking along the wall until he noticed a dim light coming through the wall... the holes where some pipes were going through the brickwork were letting out a sort of <b><i>weird light</i></b>, possibly electrical.<br/>Tapping the wall with the flashlight he assessed that there was empty space on the other side, so he put his back on the solid wall, his feel on the ancient brickwork, and heaved, hoping to push the bricks loose.<br/>It worked. Dust and bricks came down. He entered the passage.<br/><br/>[another die roll, this time luckyer]<br/><br/>- - -                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448687/#Comment_448687" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-22T16:47:56+00:00" title="September 22, 2015  4:47PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 24, 2015 3:37PM by Hasimir.">edited September 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CHAPTER THREE - Descent</span></b><br/><b>Station</b> :  Geburah<br/><b>Shadows</b> : <i>harsh judgment, limitation, confinement, punishment</i><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>Scene 14</i></span><br/>Looking around through the settling dust, Rani saw a room full of machinery... sort of electrical panels and button consoles full of glowing lights and leds. The source of the <b><i>weird lights</i></b>, and currently the only light source in the room.<br/>Looking around he noticed that some panels had also tags with stuff written on them in german; the nearest and most visible read <b><i>"Cell #1" and "Cell #2"</i></b>.<br/>There was a door on the other side of the room, but Rani decided to not risk it alone; instead he climbed back up and went looking for Bernard.<br/><br/>[another successful roll]<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>Scene 15</i></span><br/>Rani explains the situation to Bernard, but the colleague seems to not hear him, being only concerned with the idea that Rani carved a hole through a wall, unauthorized, without any security standard, damaging the client's property and very likely putting both their jobs in jeopardy.<br/>Rani insists that he comes along to look at what he found and, after some convincing, Bernard follows him into the boiler room.<br/>"Yeah ok there is an interspace, so what?! YOU MADE A FUKING HUGE HOLE IN THE WALL!"<br/>"Climb it down with me, you have to see what I saw!"<br/>"Man you are crazy, no fucking way!, and you're gonna get us both fired!"<br/>Bernard storms out of the basement.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>Scene 16</i></span><br/>Rani is once more walking through the park at night to go back home after the gym.<br/>Again he feels the <b><i>smell of stagnant water and mould</i></b>, quite out of place, and this time he also hears a sort of <b><i>metallic clunking sound</i></b>.<br/>He thinks of pipes and boiler rooms with a chill, but steels himself and instead of running away goes on to check the source of the sound.<br/>It was just the swings in the children's area; rusty metal chains moved by the wind.<br/>But then, in the darkness beyond the swings, near the far bushes, an <b><i>old man</i></b> stares at him... the same man he glimpsed in his window.<br/>Rani freezes with fear... and the Moment ends.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>Scene 17</i></span><br/>Rani is home, in front of his computer, reading an email from his brother, from Syria.<br/>Naghib tells him about his life as a freedom fighter, as a fugitive and a protester; all is fine, all is good, I love you brother...<br/>Rani feels guilt and shame, as his problems seem so stupid and trivial in comparison to the ones Naghib is facing, living in a war-zone.<br/>Maybe all of this situation is just caused by stress and paranoia, maybe he is imagining things and overreacting too much and making himself scared for no good reason, just like he did when he was a child, always afraid of things that were not there.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>Scene 18</i></span><br/>In the company's office Rani is speaking to his boss about the sub-basement he found.<br/>The boss seems to not be too much upset, but is also not really listening.<br/>He is worried for Rani's health, he already spoke with Bernard, the hole is a problem but can be somehow justifies... Rani has always been a good worker and must have had his reason, etc etc etc.<br/>But no, no one needs to go into the sub-basement. It is not on the maps, it is not in their contract, it is not part of their job UNLESS the client says otherwise. Checks will be made, papers will be compiled and sent, bureaucracy will have its curse.<br/>Until then Rani is to stay well away from that place and never mention that he climbed down without proper security measures.<br/>That, or they will have to let him go...<br/>Frustrated beyond words Rani opts to not press the issue.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>Scene 19</i></span><br/>Rani goes to visit Margaret in her apartment. It's been days since they last spoke, which is unusual, and he really needs a friend to listen to him. Also, the other time she promised to help him dig more info about the history of the building...<br/>He finds her in a weird state of mind, very despondent, almost absent minded.<br/>But she claims (feebly) to be OK.<br/>The conversation languishes until he sees a folder of papers on her table... she did find some more info...<br/>An article from an old newspaper talking about nazi medical experiments; human trials, <b><i>disfigured victims</i></b> found in the area surrounding the building, dumped in the river. There was also a live witness that got interviewed, a survivor none the less, that the attached picture reveals to look very much like the <b><i>old man</i></b> Rani saw in the park... only a bit younger. His name was Franz Herrmanz, while the reporter's name was Uwe Schmidt.<br/><br/>[the <b>Menace</b> reaches the Touched One again]<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>Scene 20 - Dark Moment</i></span><br/>Shireen is at home, waiting for Rani to come back from work.<br/>After a full day of her own job she needs a shower.<br/>Naked, with her eyes closed while soaping her hair, she smells stagnant water and mould in the air, and feels something cold and slime-y with her feet.<br/>Washing away the soap from her eyes she sees some black viscous substance coming out of the bathtub hole. And an instant later she clearly feels something moving in that mud, something that caresses her ankle like a sort of snake.<br/>Screaming she tries to get out of the tub but slips and falls on her lower back, covering herself in the black slime. Now frantic she claws at the shower curtains, finally climbing out of the tub to end up, sobbing, on the cold floor.<br/><br/>[this is where we stopped the game session]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448723">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448723/#Comment_448723" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-24T15:46:46+00:00" title="September 24, 2015  3:46PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Done!<br/>Woooooh this one was a biggie <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aaron_Griffin" title="Aaron_Griffin"><img alt="Aaron_Griffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/469/nQL6632G2O226.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aaron_Griffin">Aaron_Griffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448731/#Comment_448731" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-24T18:11:52+00:00" title="September 24, 2015  6:11PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can you explain the Station/Shadows bits?

Once something has been introduced in the story, though, it can be reused freely.<br/><br/>This list is built by advancing in the story from one Chapter to the next.<br/>The story is structured in 5 chapters, all laid out on a Path (a map).<br/><br/>Stations are "places" on the Path, there are many, and you only ever end up in a single one for each Chapter. Every Station adds one entry on the list of possible shadows.<br/><br/>In addition to this, even within the realm of normal/mundane things, any <b>shock material</b> is forbidden unless filtered through some <b><i>Degrees of Separation</i></b> (2 in the first chapter, 1 in the second, 0 from the third onward).<br/><br/>Basically a Touched One can't simply happen to stumble on a corpse. She might be told about a dead body by someone else (indirect) and this someone might be drunk or a bit crazy (unreliable).<br/>Or she might read about it (indirect) on an old old newspaper (distant in time).<br/>Etc..<br/><br/>Again, after something has been initially injected in the story, it can be freely used. So after a Touched One learns about the corpse, she might freely act to find it and look at it first hand.<br/><br/>This way the story starts mundane and slowly raises in creepiness and unease, eventually progressing into dread and the final horror.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
