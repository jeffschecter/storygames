I've never been interested in playing in media characters before but this idea sounded so good to me. Added to that my buddy's been wanting to run a SW game.<br/><br/>The game would be played with the goal that Anakin will become Darth Vader in the last act of episode 3, Padme will die in a logical and emotionally ressonant way after Leia is old enough to form memories (early language acquisition), and most importantly Jar-Jar Binks will enter the scene and quickly be eaten by a large resident of the Gungan biosphere. At first the scenes will follow the 1st movie with the exception that Anakin is 16-18 years old to start and there will be a notable lack of a character with the initials JJB. As things go, dependent on the player's actions, the whole story changes.<br/><br/>So what system would you use? <br/><br/>Edit: Okay apparently Evan and Daniele Di Rubbo have been working on just such a project.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Praion" title="Praion"><img alt="Praion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Praion">Praion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388904/#Comment_388904" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-31T05:53:34+00:00" title="August 31, 2012  5:53AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lady Blackbird Hack?

Their "religion" would already be in decline, and Anakin's eventual slaying of the Jedi would be more symbolic than decisive.<br/>--make Anakin a rebel slave who uses his power to single-handedly overthrow the Hutts, only to become sick of the bureaucracy and B.S. that modern power systems require as he takes over leadership of Tatooine<br/>--have Palpatine be an opportunist more than a master plotter \u2013 someone who sees his (beloved) Republic crumbling and learns the Sith powers in order to "correct" it; like the Nazis, he would already have his monumental plans for starships and whatnot ready to roll out once he seized power.<br/>--bring Padme in as the girl Anakin can't have because of <i>her</i> political commitments, but she's totally attracted to him and so they have this hot love affair and Anakin uses his Dark Side powers to mask it from Yoda.<br/>--promote Leia as the true head of the Rebel alliance, who then perceives Luke as the upstart kid who might be usurping her power... until it turns out he's just like Anakin and hates actual leadership<br/>--show Luke as being so much like Anakin that he actually falls to the Dark Side, and it's a painful choice as to whether or not to follow in his father's legacy (the New Order of the Empire) or join his sister in the Rebellion (the Old Aristocratic Order behind the supposedly "democratic" Republic).<br/><br/>Basically, I want the injustices that created Darth Vader in the first place to be <i>societal</i> rather than <i>personal</i>, and that Luke then has to choose between military fascism and aristocratic oligarchy, as in between the lesser of two evils.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388922">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jacob" title="Jacob"><img alt="Jacob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jacob">Jacob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388922/#Comment_388922" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-31T08:16:27+00:00" title="August 31, 2012  8:16AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joss Whedon.<br/><br/>oh wait, game system, nm.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388923/#Comment_388923" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-31T08:26:10+00:00" title="August 31, 2012  8:26AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now I really want to do a Clone Wars version of The Regiment and I'm itching to photoshop clone troopers and republican officers into the playbooks.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388932/#Comment_388932" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-31T10:14:27+00:00" title="August 31, 2012 10:14AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/mease19">@mease19</a> -

When West End Games gave up the ghost, they took the D6 engine that Star Wars used and released it as <a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/29204/D6-Core-Set-%5BBUNDLE%5D?manufacturers_id=468&amp;it=1" rel="nofollow">Open Source materials</a>.  Others have tinkered with the OpenD6 core, including AntiPaladin Games, with their free PDF <a href="http://antipaladingames.com/minisix.html" rel="nofollow">Mini Six</a>. They include a couple of settings in the back of the book, including a generic <i>Star Wars</i> style setting called <i>Imperium in Revolt. </i><br/><br/>Hope this helps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388946/#Comment_388946" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-31T11:58:03+00:00" title="August 31, 2012 11:58AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All games can be used to play Star Wars.  <br/><br/>Star Wars is a hologram.  A fractal.  A Rorschach test.  What system you choose to play Star Wars says much about what you think Star Wars is about.  If you use Polaris, then your prequels are about holy knights fighting to save a doomed civilization.  If you choose My Life With Master, your game might be about Sith apprentices trying to please their dark overlord.  If you use Feng Shui, it's all action and melodrama and little of 'plot' or 'social relevance'.  If you use Misspent Youth, it's about youthful rebellion and learning from your friends.  If you choose Microscope, it's about events bigger than any one character.  Different systems reflect the story and setting in different ways.<br/><br/>Star Wars succeeds in part because it means different things to different people.  This means that there is no one right way to do Star Wars.

Luke was angry and aggressive just like his father. To me Yoda's council that a Jedi uses his power for knowledge and defense never for attack seemed pointed at exactly that. I would like to use Yoda's council as the elements that cause Anakin to fall.

I think the series should have been restructered with the assumption that Anakin becomes Darth Vader at the end of the 2nd movie, and the 3rd movie is about the fall of the jedi as he hunts them down - ending triumphant, but with a clearly visible (to us, the audience) hope for the future hidden away on tattoine.<br/><br/>If anything is salvageable from the 1st two movies they would be combined into one better starting movie, introducing anakin (without a jar jar binks in site) and padme, as well as the future emperor. The jedis and future emperor's plotting would take centre stage in the second movie, leading up to a conflict and moral choice for anakin and he takes a different route to the one Luke took in Empire Strikes Back.<br/><br/>As to the RPG used... Lots of great suggestions already. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388999/#Comment_388999" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-01T07:27:40+00:00" title="September  1, 2012  7:27AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Meh, I maintain that JarJar was the most enjoyable and developed character in the first film.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Onix" title="Onix"><img alt="Onix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/814/nLOXPRKOM00IG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Onix">Onix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389014/#Comment_389014" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-01T15:18:06+00:00" title="September  1, 2012  3:18PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Meh, I maintain that JarJar was the most enjoyable and developed character in the first film. </blockquote>Most developed, maybe.

I personally like a three movie arch something like this.<br/><br/>Movie One: Palpatine is the hero. He and Obi Wan have an adventure on Anakin's home world that draws him into a life of adventure. The story makes you like all of them. It ends with Anakin's leaving home to become a Jedi.<br/><br/>Movie Two: The Clone War begins. The clones are the bad guys. Padme is introduced. The story is more complicated because it is not just good and evil. Good still wins but at a cost of innocence. May clones are replacing people, maybe Palpatine?<br/><br/>Movie Three: We know Palpatine is now bad but the heroes don't - the Jedi have to be ambushed and destroyed after all. Anakin's has to become totally compromised but the reason has to be to do good. The means don't justify the ends though so this makes everything fall apart. The whole this is a sad exercise in tragic mistake. It has to look like there is hope for redemption but it can't happen. We need to want it to happen, but we can't have it happen. I'd end it with the secretly pregnant Padme leaving but that is just because the pathos is stronger. We know she dies but it really doesn't have to be part of the fall. Her leaving says it all.<br/><br/>I've thougt way too much about this...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389133/#Comment_389133" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-03T18:29:42+00:00" title="September  3, 2012  6:29PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 3, 2012 6:29PM by Evan_Torner.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">@MatrixGamer</a>:<br/><br/>I think we all have.<br/><br/>There was so much anticipation up to that fateful spring of 1999, since we had all imagined what these prequels could've been.<br/><br/>Lucas' bid for our imaginations failed.<br/><br/>In a reboot-happy era, it's time for us to lay our counter-proposals on the table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389135">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Onix" title="Onix"><img alt="Onix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/814/nLOXPRKOM00IG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Onix">Onix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389135/#Comment_389135" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-03T18:58:26+00:00" title="September  3, 2012  6:58PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">@MatrixGamer</a> I sympathise. I have always had a picture in my head of what the prequels would be, based on what was said in the first movies.<br/><br/>1. Luke is angry like his father<br/>2. When Ben met Anakin, he was already a great starpilot and a cunning warrior. I'm liking the idea of Anakin fighting the huts to free the slaves on this one.<br/>3. Obi-Wan thinks he could train Anakin as well as Yodah but is proven wrong. This must tie into the anger that Yoda fears in Luke. It's his primary concern. Ben still doesn't recognize this as a problem when he's training Luke. I did like how Qui-gon, is portrayed as a bit of a renegade and he may not have trained Obi-won to worry about anger because it was never an issue with them.<br/>4. Yoda says that a Jedi uses the force for knowledge and defense, never for attack. Yet Luke uses it to force choke the gammorians in Jabba's palace. The Jedi do force pushes all the time. This means there has to be some wiggle room in this, but if you stick to Yoda's instruction you're safe.<br/>5. Anger, fear and aggression lead to the dark side. However they don't automatically since a good number of times Luke and other Jedi act aggressively. Again, wiggle room, almost like a precipice that you only know where the edge is when you're calm, at peace, passive.<br/>6. Leia remembers her mother, possibly by the force, having a vision of her but I'd prefer that the twins are three to four years old when separated from their mother.<br/>7. Darth Vader (not Anakin) hunted down the Jedi.<br/><br/>Now, impressions that I have.<br/><br/>Anakin is powerful to start with although untrained. He may have learned to instinctively tap into the force with his emotions. This becomes a difficult habit for him to break.<br/>Anakin might view Obi-wan's and Yoda's efforts to get him to break his emotional use of the force as keeping him from being the best he can be. Maybe this is really drilled into a padawan but when one becomes a Jedi, they let the screws off a little and they are allowed to show some aggression, some anger. Anakin sees this and feels he's just as good or better than them if they'd only let him shine.<br/>Palpatine is fine, starting as a Senator. He should however notice the anger in Anakin and take him under his wing early. Possibly seeding Anakin with doubts about the Jedi order. Feeding his ego, going through huge efforts to give him special awards for his contribution to the war. Then he reveals that he "dabbles" in the force. At first Anakin would likely be worried about this but Palpatine is his friend. Palpatine might reason with him along the lines "If a sentient has an affinity for the force but has never heard of Jedi, what do they do? They have to find their own way just like you've had to do. Does that make them bad?" Then he might reveal alien writings that were "useful" to him. These would not be Sith texts but would introduce the concept of other sources of guidance for the force.<br/>The Jedi are taught to not use the force in fear. Maybe this is one of the hardest emotions to work through and still stay away from the Dark Side. They are fearful that a Sith will emerge and therefore cannot try and see him using the force.<br/><br/>Padme and the visions of her dying, if done better could be used to great effect. Introducing the visions early could reinforce the idea as a problem of real concern. Give the promise of the Sith having the power to save someone from death more weight comes back to the idea of Palpatine giving Anakin "alternate teachings" in the form of books (or holocrons) precedence and it's a pattern. Very simply this technique may require enormous power and strong emotion. Anakin might try to use the power to fix the vision but not be able to. He is set on a quest to gain more and more power, relying more and more on his emotions. Thus falling further and further to the Dark Side.<br/><br/>Palpatine, in the meantime is setting up the Jedi so that he can have them slaughtered.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Icel" title="Icel"><img alt="Icel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/505/n7G8E3X2QBUOV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Icel">Icel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389140/#Comment_389140" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-03T22:10:42+00:00" title="September  3, 2012 10:10PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 3, 2012 10:32PM by Icel.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Joss Whedon.<br/><br/>oh wait, game system, nm.</blockquote>\nI LOL'd :-D<br/><br/>I'd use MHR just because I like it as a system, and it can be used to portray characters of different power levels working together.<br/>Using Milestones, you can direct player to the scenarios you imagine, and reward them with Unlocks which advances the overall plot.<br/><br/>On a side note, Qui-Gon and Darth Maul are my favorite characters in the entire series, despite everything else.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389141">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389141/#Comment_389141" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-03T23:12:15+00:00" title="September  3, 2012 11:12PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lots of other good suggestions here, but I think I'd personally take a long hard look at Amber.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389158/#Comment_389158" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-04T07:06:53+00:00" title="September  4, 2012  7:06AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Onix<br/><br/>I like your version to.

He's very much interested in bringing "balance" to the force. Since the Jedi are not immediately experiencing a problem with the Sith, that would mean that light side force use was out of whack. As such, I find Qui-gon's excitement about the prophecy either naive or he's interested in there being fewer Jedi. In any event it makes some strong statements about Qui-gon. It also suggests that the Jedi are aware that their use of the force is unbalancing it.

Every time you do something significantly dark side-y, roll an X-sided die. If the number you roll is on your list, you fall to the dark side. If not, write it down. Some things can add/remove numbers from the list. X is determined by how likely you want it to be that people will fall.<br/><br/>2) You've got a deck of cards. Every time you do something significantly dark side-y, draw a card. If it's a king, set it aside. Otherwise, discard it. When you have all 4 kings, you fall. If you want people to be less likely to fall, also require queens, or whatever.<br/><br/>3) You've got a deck of cards and a "Dark Side Score", which ranges 1-10 (or whatever). Every time you do something significantly dark side-y, increase your score by 1 and draw that many cards. If you get a (pair, triple, quadruple), you fall; if not, just shuffle them back in.<br/><br/>1 is inspired a bit by Misspent Youth, and 2 by Murderous Ghosts. All of them provide an environment where you get progressively more likely to fall, but you're never quite sure if *this* will be the time - you only know vaguely how close you are.<br/><br/>There are, I'm sure, way more ideas, too!<br/><br/>- Alex                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Onix" title="Onix"><img alt="Onix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/814/nLOXPRKOM00IG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Onix">Onix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389858/#Comment_389858" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-11T19:02:51+00:00" title="September 11, 2012  7:02PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Normally I don't like card mechanics but in this case it just might work. Riffing off those ideas, how about this.<br/><br/>Each force user is dealt 3-8 playing cards depending on how powerful the force user is. When they want to do a force move, they use a card and the value of the card is how powerful the move is (card value + to their roll). Once used, it's discarded in a pile in front of the player and then draw from the deck.<br/><br/>Hearts are anger or fear<br/>Diamonds are aggression or lust<br/>Clubs are defense<br/>Spades are knowledge or meditation<br/><br/>The player knows what cards they're discarding but to look at the pile they need to be "calm at peace, passive". This has to cost something, like getting rid of powerful dark side cards (maybe a certain number of points). They go back into the deck, not into the discard pile.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the balance is weighed. Each force user is especially sensitive to either hearts or diamonds and gets 3-4 points instead of the usual one. They are also better at centering themselves with clubs or spades so one of these are worth 2 points. All other cards are worth 1 point. A Jedi is not allowed to know what their sensitive suits are but they can try and surmise what it is. A Jedi character may be informed of the general outline of this but a padawan or uninitiated force user will not have any knowledge of the system (at least until they play for a while).<br/><br/>At the end of a scene, if the discard pile has more dark side points than light side, the player moves closer to the dark side. (What this means I don't quite know yet. Maybe they get one dark side point)<br/><br/>Now, instead of using a heart or diamond force card, the player can return any card they want to the deck. This is them meditating and controlling their dark urges. The idea here is that it might be trivial to return a low value card to the deck but a high value card might be really handy at the right time. Since the deck will be filling up with dark side suits, it might make it harder to play it safe after a while showing the growing stress on the force users over time and the growing temptation to give in.<br/><br/>Another reason I like this is because it also conforms to "Is the dark side stronger?" "No! Easier, quicker to join you in a fight." The dark side suits aren't stronger but they open up the force user's options.<br/><br/>In later video game cannon, Darth Vader is shown throwing dozens of people around, maybe with each dark side point you can play more than one card at a time and stack the bonuses? Not sure if I like that, It goes against the paragraph above but it's an option.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390665/#Comment_390665" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-18T09:12:32+00:00" title="September 18, 2012  9:12AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 18, 2012 9:12AM by Evan_Torner.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Star Wars Microscope</i> was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">super</span> fun.<br/><br/>Part of the reason why is thanks to the mediocre prequels: Lucas gave us the opportunity to say "That's not how I imagined it" years ago, and now we've been percolating about sweeping questions in the Star Wars universe ever since.<br/><br/>The first run focused on Shmi Skywalker, Mother of Heroes, and how she came to inhabit a Nietzschean position of <i>pure will</i> which lets her later defeat her own son, Anakin.<br/><br/>The second run brought in the crimes of the Republic and the various possible factions that emerge among Force-Users: the Sith (Emperor Palpatine + Anakin), the Jedi (Yoda + Leia) and the Renegades (Mace Windu + Darth Maul + Luke).

A dark master is more likely to be able to make you do what they want.<br/><br/>And, of course, one of the things you hear dark masters in the Star Wars universe pushing people to do is to reach for the dark side power - because that will give them still more power in manipulating you.<br/><br/>You could say that when a dark jedi successfully pushes you into reaching for the dark side, they gain something equivalent to a Monsterhearts string on your character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vasco%20Brown" title="Vasco Brown"><img alt="Vasco Brown" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/720dbb7653b3d0bf450544cf2959a255.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vasco%20Brown">Vasco Brown</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391106/#Comment_391106" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-22T12:48:00+00:00" title="September 22, 2012 12:48PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Pheylorn%27s">@Pheylorn's</a> <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/17244/star-wars-world-an-apocalypse-world-hack-" rel="nofollow">Star Wars World</a> hack seems like it's a good place to start.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391136/#Comment_391136" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-23T01:09:32+00:00" title="September 23, 2012  1:09AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>There was a point of no return, sure -- but one did not know where it was for one's PC, let alone anyone else's.</blockquote>\nSo how was that accomplished?

character that is made hateful by Lucas' terrible characterisation. Maybe a slight rewrite needs to be undergone, say:<br/>Jar Jar, a completely competent soldier within the Gungan forces(Well, thats the biggest character change right here), outcast for breaking some social convention- maybe actually trying to push for the Gungans and Humans of Naboo to reconcile- encounters the Jedi, goes on their little adventure, and goes from social exile to war hero overnight.<br/>Now the Gungans require a Senator, becoming an individualy recognised civilisation in their own right, and Jar Jar is manipulated by Palpatine into running, and unintentionally rides the wave of this new Gungan pride, all the way to Coruscant. He is a capable soldier, but a bit of a fish out of water in the social and political environment he finds himself in. Its a pretty standard storytelling trope.<br/>Naturally, Palpatine's reasoning is that it gives him an extra vote in the senate, as well as someone to propose his 'reforms' for him. When a chancellor asks for executive power, ever the consumate soldier, Jar Jar thinks this is genuinely a pretty smart idea. In wartime, it will keep the army moving quickly, and keep the republic capable of responding to the confederate threat(Which he naturally thinks is the worst thing ever, despite them having a resoundingly solid political point). He puts the motion forwards and a frightened senate listens to the experienced soldier's warning, some even thanking him for offering advice in his area of expertise.<br/><br/>Suddenly we go from offensive and annoying 'comic relief' character to a serious and interesting extra element in the political spectrum of the Republic...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17136/whats-the-best-system-to-retell-the-star-wars-1-3-the-right-way" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17136/whats-the-best-system-to-retell-the-star-wars-1-3-the-right-way" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17136/whats-the-best-system-to-retell-the-star-wars-1-3-the-right-way/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F17136%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F17136%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
