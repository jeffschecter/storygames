<a href="http://www.gamingreport.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=Sections&amp;file=index&amp;req=viewarticle&amp;artid=193" rel="nofollow">New Out of the Box colum from Origins.</a><br/><br/>"Occasionally I'm taken to task by various peers and colleagues for "buying into the indie mystique," but I will say this. Leaving aside the issue that the "indie movement" has produced at least half of the true RPG masterpieces in the last five years, the various self-identifying "indie" game designers I meet at these shows are almost always folks whose first instinct is to talk about game design. "<br/><br/>"The Vanguard Awards -- allegedly for innovation and uniqueness -- were a slightly mixed bag, going to a sequel and a computer game, among other weird choices, but they also went to the very popular and cool Perplex City and Greg Porter's deserving Infinite Armies. "<br/><br/>"Probably the best new game I saw at the show, Brennan Taylor's Mortal Coil (93 digest-sized pages, black and white softcover with six full color plates, $22) is essentially the game of magical revelation." <br/><br/>"But the central core is sleek and fine, and Jennifer Rodgers' art is quite simply amazing, kind of an Art Nouveau Mike Mignola, if such thing exists."                        </div>

                            This may be entirely self-serving, but <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=277693" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> came at me entirely out of left field. A discussion about using Burning Wheel to run a|state. Not something i had thought of before, but the OP makes some very good points about the salient points of BW that would fit perfectly with a|state. Kind of allowed me to talk about some of the ideas I've been having for a revised system as well.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malc                        </div>

The corpse just hasn't quite hit the floor yet. There's maybe 3 or 4 companies making an actual, viable go of it. The rest are on their way out or are treading water, waiting for that one big hit to take them out.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, someone like Chad Underkoffler can sell several hundred copies of an RPG via online PDF and POD sales. He probably has moved as many copies of his game as what passes for a second string (non-WotC/WW) company these days.<br/><br/>There's a ton of reasons why this is true, but it's interesting to see almost all of Ron's proclamations circa 1999 come true. It's been interesting to watch the venom spewed at him by the dinosaur club in light of that."<br/><br/>Luke: "We may not be making 36K a year in profits, but this particular push in the RPG market is very young. It has legs and it's growing, whereas all signs seem to point to the rest of the traditional game publishing infrastructure shrinking.<br/><br/>Right way, wrong way, whatever. Chris is pointing out that there is a new way to do things and it is financially viable and has the potential for serious long term benefit -- we will continue to profit from our games for their entire lives which, as we know, can easily stretch into ten years.<br/><br/>What I'm interested in is the next step, when some of the small self-published operations gain enough momentum that they have to transform into a bigger business. I want to see how things wash out under those circumstances. Do they maintain all the bad habits or are they really something new?"<br/><br/>Go check it out.                        </div>

<br/>
There's been a great thread running on BW about the Duel of Wits mechanic. It's applicable to game talk in general since it is essentially a "roll play vs roleplay" discussion. The twist is the lead poster in the thread is a long time friend of mine and has played BW since its inception. He is also incredibly aggressive and belligerent at the table and our blowout arguments (that have led to me ending many a game) were one of the main drives for me to create the social conflict system in the Duel of Wits. I wanted to curtail what I saw as bullying type behavior. Well, predictably, he comes back at me saying that the DoW crimps his style.<br/>
<br/>
It's an interesting read. Check it out.<br/>
