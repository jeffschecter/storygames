To me, at first, it looked like "Generic Boxed Set RPG set in Colonial Africa". It was Jerry Grayson who told me why it was awesome:<br/><br/>* The game comes with two open, sketchy maps of Africa. As you go on expeditions and head deeper into the continent, you fill out more of the map. Eventually, your group has a map detailing your adventures which is unique to your game group.<br/>* You manage resources Oregon Trail style while going on these expeditions.<br/>* The backstory develops in play. Cthulhu-esque stories of dark demons and cultists emerge as you go deeper.<br/><br/>So, this might be a stretch, as I haven't heard any buzz about this game in the 8 or so years since its initial release (and many folks here aren't into the boxed games), but has anyone played this?  What sorts of things happened in your game? How did your map fill itself out?<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165630/#Comment_165630" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-27T07:20:50+00:00" title="August 27, 2008  7:20AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 27, 2008 7:22AM by Rich Stokes.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I bought a copy at the last proper UK Gen Con back in about 2002.  I bought it because:\n<ul><li>The guys on the stall seemed really passionate about the game.  They made it sound pretty cool.</li>\n<li>They seemed really nice, and I liked them.</li>\n<li>You seemed to get a lot in the box and it all looked really cool.  Nice art, good production values etc.</li>\n<li>Boxed set.  I mean, how cool is that?</li>\n<li>It wasn't d20.  That seems silly, but at the time it was one of only about 3 new games I saw that year that weren't.</li></ul>\nSo I got it home and started reading it and, well, I dunno, it just didn't work for me at all.  It had a pretty crap system, which was basically a re-hash of CoC.  the whole "supernatural thing" (what did they call that, "Hungry Night" or something?) was really, really cool.  The idea that you started the game as if it was just a regular historical game and then introduce the supernatural elements seemed neat, but I thought this was a bit of a bait and switch and I'm not a fan of hiding stuff that fundamental in a GM's book.<br/><br/>Dunno, I have to say I didn't really ever feel the urge to run it.  Maybe I should re-visit it through fresh eyes, maybe I'll see some awesome I missed back then.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165638/#Comment_165638" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-27T07:38:09+00:00" title="August 27, 2008  7:38AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rich Stokes</cite>The idea that you started the game as if it was just a regular historical game and then introduce the supernatural elements seemed neat, but I thought this was a bit of a bait and switch and I'm not a fan of hiding stuff that fundamental in a GM's book.</blockquote>\nAhhh, I see.  Yeah, the pitch I got came from my friend, who basically stated up front what it was. I couldn't imagine getting my friends to play it any other way, because the buildup from "normal exploration" to "CoC-style madness" is long enough that I imagine everyone would be getting pretty fucking bored with it if they don't know that *something* is coming later.<br/><br/>I mean, if you are the only GM for a game, and can hold your group hostage for half a year, then you might be able to go through the whole motions of starting normal and gradually introducing horror without telling the players in advance what to expect. But I couldn't imagine it working with my groups, without at least telling them "...and dark horror lurks the futher you go in" or "...and the setting changes the more you explore", or *something*. I might not spill the GM secrets, but I'd definitely let the players know that the whole campaign isn't going to be waxed moustaches, natives carrying baskets of your trousers on their heads, and rhinoceros hunting.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165646/#Comment_165646" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-27T08:01:29+00:00" title="August 27, 2008  8:01AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paging <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/1577" rel="nofollow">Source of the Nile</a>!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165666">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165666/#Comment_165666" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-27T09:00:15+00:00" title="August 27, 2008  9:00AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>I mean, if you are the only GM for a game, and can hold your group hostage for half a year, then you might be able to go through the whole motions of starting normal and gradually introducing horror without telling the players in advance what to expect.</blockquote>\nSeriously dude, if I'd ever sat down and started running this with the homies at Chez Stokes, they'd have known something was up.  I mean, the chances of me running a purely historical game are roughly zero.  So they'd expect it to get all Allan Quatermain pretty fast.  So I figure the chances of that bait and switch happening are pretty zero.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165675/#Comment_165675" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-27T09:47:41+00:00" title="August 27, 2008  9:47AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, in relation to the expedition management aspects of the game, it got me thinking back to Oregon Trail for a second, and this hilarious picture:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://kotaku.com/assets/images/kotaku/2008/08/hakbkaabe.jpg"/><br/><br/>I dunno, that screams Roleplaying Scenario to me.<br/><br/>"Jed Smith: Frontier grandfather clock salesman and pioneer"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165728">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165728/#Comment_165728" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-27T11:17:52+00:00" title="August 27, 2008 11:17AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Paging Source of the Nile!</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nI love love love me some Source of the Nile...so much so that I paid some obscene amount to get a copy off of Ebay cuz the one I played the crap out of as a kid wasn't mine.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts a bit dated and has a fair level of clunk to it by today's standards...but there's something tactically thrilling about drawing a jungle tree on the map board with a wax crayon and watching the path of your expedition fill in the heart of Africa.
