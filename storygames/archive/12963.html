We were in a bit of a silly mood, and the game had taken awhile to really get going, pacing-wise, though in the end the slow stuff from the beginning quite paid off.  Our silly mood in particular came from making a lot of jokes about Inception, like our characters knocking off from work early to go see it again and critique all the ways in which Nolan didn't quite get it right.<br/><br/>We dive.  We find the HP.  She's strapped to a hospital bed, having been wounded by the Blue City police during a botched bank robbery.  Thing is, she's not just some random person, she's a friend of ours, an agent who went on the first mission with us (whose player couldn't make it for this session).  She's unconscious and can't communicate with us, but we really really want to talk to her before putting the Device on her, to try to find out how she went nuts and all.<br/><br/>At this point, the three of us PCs kind of look at each other, in that sort of "ok, well, we know what we have to do but it's going to be realllllly bad" sort of way.  And we burst out laughing.  And then we make an Access roll... and requisition four slabs!  And we Dive into the next level of the HP's subconscious!  For the win!<br/><br/>Some other loopy stuff ensued, but what really stands out to me is the memory of the moment when all our jokes came back to kick us in the ass and impel us to greater awesomeness.<br/><br/>Matt                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292215">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292215/#Comment_292215" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-08T09:11:00+00:00" title="September  8, 2010  9:11AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You win at Lacuna.

This says something about my and Matt's comparative base silliness levels. X3<br/><br/>Seriously, though, has anyone else tried to dive into Level 2 in Lacuna before?
