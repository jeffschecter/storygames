The potential problem is if a player has destructive play habits. By this I mean, if a player doesn't want the game to work, is not interested in what it has to offer or cannot perceive the techniques used by the game (even when they are in plain sight), then he might get into a rut of repeating his D&amp;D experience - leveling up at insane speeds for no other purpose than leveling up and getting to shine in the eyes of the other players.<br/><br/>However, I've found that if this is not the case and the player just is a bit insecure or impatient, then it is no problem at all to give the player what he wants: faster progression via lots of Keys, which he'll presumably leverage himself in play (as opposed to waiting passively for the SG to work his ass off to hit every one of them). It is not <i>wrong</i> to want a fast-progressing character or a powerful character in TSoY, per se; that sort of thing only becomes a problem if the player has some problematic goals of habits. I removed the 5-Key limit in my Solar System booklet specifically because the issue almost never came up in actual play, and when it did, I actually overrode the rule because it does nothing when the game is played to intent. And if it's not, then that rule won't save the game.<br/><br/>I don't know the player in question so I have no idea at all if his motivation is more along the lines of wanting a complex character or whether he's just rubbing his hands in glee at how he's now "broken" the game and gets to piss on everybody else's characters with his superior firepower. Additional fun times are had when we realize that roleplayers are often so constrained by their own legends of "good play" that they'll routinely lie to others and even themselves about the reasons for what they do; I've never encountered a player who'd be blind enough to sit and play TSoY with mechanical character-optimization in mind while at the same time being perceptive enough to be honest about his motivations - each time I've encountered this sort of thing the player has been thoroughly disciplined into saying that he's just doing it to fulfill his character vision or whatever's the magic word in the local culture for getting to do whatever you want without taking each game on their own merits.<br/><br/>In summation: I've seen it work, I've seen it fail, and the reasons have always been squarely on the player who chose to create such a lopsided character. If he's doing it for a purpose (and one that is in harmony with TSoY to boot), then it's probably good; if he's confused about the goals of the game or just creates lopsided characters to avenge his abuse in the hands of tyrant GMs, then it's perhaps better if somebody reins him in for his own good and shows him how the game runs for a couple of sessions before letting him make his own decisions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_198463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198463/#Comment_198463" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-23T19:27:56+00:00" title="March 23, 2009  7:27PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>That sounds like one of those Gamists to me.

This is especially true if you follow the Solar System guidelines for activating Keys - that is, each individual Key activation should result from significant in-fiction events, and several Keys of the same character should not be activated on the basis of the same content. I use those sorts of guidelines as the Story Guide to control the Key situation a bit - it's not quite penalizing having multiple Keys, and I'm pretty loose on those principles of limitation; I just make sure that all Keys are handled as weighty matters in the fiction of the game, and allowed the amount of attention they deserve. In effect: each time a Key is activated, the audience should be focused on the issue the Key reflects. If this is not happening, then the Key scoring is being done in a too private or mechanical manner, when it should be a signal for the whole group to appreciate the character's situation.<br/><br/>A well-known technique for getting everything out of multiple Keys is to buy them off in quick succession to "go nova" on the story. The character burns his past, essentially, to become something new that can survive the drastically altered situation. High drama, very fun. Any character with multiple Keys has plenty of opportunities for doing this sort of thing as long as they are willing to make that break and change. The Story Guide should be serious about the limitation that you can only have a given Key once - if the crunch landscape of the game handles Keys as a sort of improvised list (like mine usually does), then make sure that the player doesn't later on replace his "Key of Romance" with a "Key of Love" or some such, essentially the same Key with a different name. Each buyoff is paid for with a permanent scar.<br/><br/>Assuming that the player wants to score his Keys efficiently, you might find that he'll race ahead of the other characters in terms of experience. We can discuss that as well if you find it problematic, but the issue is pretty simple in final consideration: the system does not care how powerful or fast-developing characters are, it's all part and parcel of the freedom the players have in taking action or not taking action, shaping their characters the way they are comfortable with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198492">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198492/#Comment_198492" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-24T07:01:32+00:00" title="March 24, 2009  7:01AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played in games where one character was burning through Keys and becoming more competent while others progressed more slowly.

A guy who blows through a bunch of Keys and gets very powerful is essentially writing himself out of the story, which is fine.  In my experience the opposite is more likely to be a problem - a player who is unwilling to buy off Keys, or doesn't really grasp the occasional necessity to play tactically to get what he wants at the "cost" of character transformation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_198642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198642/#Comment_198642" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-24T20:25:52+00:00" title="March 24, 2009  8:25PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, great advice, thanks!<br/><br/>Here's the character:<br/><br/>He's a Guardsman, part of small guard company, and a bit of an opportunist.

Any neat ways to get cool story out of any of these Keys that you're particularly fond of?<br/><br/>The first thought that comes to me is that the younger guardsman (Key of Fraternity) tries to lead him into danger...<br/><br/>Am I thinking along the right lines?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198668">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/oliof" title="oliof"><img alt="oliof" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.mausdompteur.de/gravn32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/oliof">oliof</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198668/#Comment_198668" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-25T03:28:59+00:00" title="March 25, 2009  3:28AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are nice pairings, as you saw your self: Fraternity lines up with Cowardice, and Glittering Gold with Superstition if you make the riches come from 'tainted' sources.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_198670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198670/#Comment_198670" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-25T04:46:56+00:00" title="March 25, 2009  4:46AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, he's off-loading all the work on you, unless the younger guardsman is also a PC (which he isn't, which sucks).  They are all external and require input from you to be activated.  You might point out to him how very suboptimal this is from the perspective of accumulating XP.  Pairing Bloodlust with Coward, for example, provides a nice contradiction and requires him to make an XP-earning choice every time he is confronted with violence.  There are lots of concordant pairs like that.  I guess Fraternity works like that, although it isn't in opposition to Coward exactly.  And it means you'll be putting that lil' guardsman in harm's way again and again, stealing focus from player characters.  <br/><br/>From my POV, no Keys tied to other player characters is a big red flag.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198686/#Comment_198686" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-25T07:29:13+00:00" title="March 25, 2009  7:29AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason and Harald,<br/><br/>Great points!<br/><br/>Fortunately, I only have two players for now, so I think that as long as I tie the younger guardsman to the other PC, we'll be OK for now. If the game becomes more long-term, I'll encourage the player to buy some Keys that target other PCs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
