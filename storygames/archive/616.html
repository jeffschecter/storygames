                    In this <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=607&amp;page=1#Item_0" rel="nofollow">thread</a> Larry wrote:<br/><br/><code>I wish Monster Burner had been a supplement dedicated to tying the monsters to a stake and setting them on fire. That would be a fun game. Alas, no.</code><br/><br/><b>Setting</b><br/><br/>A small village in the middle of nowhere surrounded on one side by cold big mountains, the other side by a hot flat desert, the other side by a salty big sea, and the other side by a lush green impenetrable forest.<br/>The village has a town square, some farms, housing, a theater, and a medieval disco, and not to mention the House of Pain, and a big tower to watch for monsters.<br/>Monsters live in all the areas that surround the town and they like to eat townfolk and break things.  They invade the town all the time.<br/><br/><b>Create a Burning Monster Character</b><br/><br/>All characters in Burning Monsters Now with Stakes consist of two stat dice pools:
<ul>
<li>Roping</li>
<li>Firestarting</li>
</ul>
Assign a d4 and a d6.  Also write down the stat of IncrediblyKillerWeapon which isn't assigned a die yet.<br/><br/>Take a deck of cards and remove everything but face cards.  Each player takes a face card.  Keep it hidden.  These card represent parts of the town that each character is defending.  When a character dies, the monster takes the card.<br/><br/><b>Create a Monster Character</b><br/><br/>The player playing the monster creates a monster using one stat and one ugly attack:
<ul>
<li>BigMeanStrongMonster</li>
<li>UglyAttack</li>
</ul>
Assign a d20 and a d12.  And also write down Anger as a dice pool, which will be added to later.<br/><br/><b>Fight</b><br/><br/><b>Step One:</b>All players not a monster roll a d6.  The highest roller gets <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">killed</span>...er...um... to go first. If two or more players roll the same number they roll at the same time and add their results together.<br/><b>Step Two:</b>The players take actions in the order determined in Step One.  Players can either Rope or Burn the Monster on their turn.  If a monster has been roped down to d6, all burning attempts gain an extra dice to roll.<br/><b>Step Two - Resolution:</b>The player rolls the dice pool equal to the stat that governs the action they are doing in Step Two.  If another player tied in step one, then they roll also and the two numbers are added together.  The monster rolls every dice.  The highest single result of one die of the two wins.<br/><b>Step Three - Damage:</b>
<ul>
<li>If the monster won in Resolution, the character is squashed -- the players makes a new character and the monster takes the now dead character's card. </li>
<li>If the character won in Resolution, one of the monster's dice is reduced by one die level (d12 becomes d10)-- the character's player picks.  </li>
<li>If the monster is damaged by Burning, then the monster gains one die a level above their highest die of anger.  All anger die start d6s. All anger die are also red.  (Example: if the monster had a d6, it gains a d8, and now has a d6 and d8 of anger.) </li>
<li>Also, if a character won, they gain one die a level above their highest die in whatever stat they would like.  When a character gains three die levels, the player can name the character, and they get to pick an extra card from the deck of face cards, and they get an extra stat called IncrediblyKillerWeapon, which starts at d10.</li>
<li>After a character is named, they get to take an extra card for each other die level they gain.</li>
</ul>
<b>Anger Die</b><br/><br/>If a monster is completely roped down and wins a fight by having its anger dice be the highest roll, then the monster breaks free of the ropes, and switches the anger die for the die in the BigMeanStrongMonster stat.<br/><br/><b>Killing the Monster</b><br/><br/>Killing the monster takes two steps:
<ol>
<li>Roping down the monster.  A monster is considered completely roped down and tied to a stake when its BigMeanStrongMonster stat is reduced to d6.  At this point burning attacks roll double the dice.</li>
<li>Burning the monster to death. Reduce BigMeanStrongMonster and UglyAttack to d4.  Whichever character to do the final fight becomes the town hero.</li>
</ol>
<b>Losing</b><br/><br/>If the players lose all the cards in the deck to the monster, the town is destroyed.  The end.                </div>

<p>I'm looking for the inevitable wordplay between "stakes" something wagered in the game, and "stakes" the sharpened wooden beam. I'm not finding it...</p>
<p>Also, you failed to use the word "burninate." What an egregious oversight.</p>
<p>I'd kinda like to see Burning Down the House be the name of the extended conflict resolution system.</p>

<p>This rule? This one's a gem! Not only do the characters suck at low levels, they don't even warrant having <em>names</em> at this point in the game. Love it. I totally-for-real-serious want to see this in a real RPG.</p>

<b>IncrediblyKillerWeapon</b><br/><br/>When a character gains the stat called IncrediblyKillerWeapon, which is a sharpened wooden beam picked up off the ground that was formed by the gods almighty in order to end the destruction of the village and when the gods declared that the villagers will <i>burninate</i> the evils beasts they formed this mighty killer stick to help in the <i>burnination</i>, the player may now invoke this item in every conflict.  To invoke IncrediblyKillerWeapon, the players must set stakes.  To do this, the player with the townsfolk character, states what will happen if she wins the conflict.  This can be one of two things, either Ã¢â‚¬Å“my character will rope the monster and reduce x statÃ¢â‚¬Â or Ã¢â‚¬Å“my character will <i>burninate</i> the monster and reduce x stat.Ã¢â‚¬Â  And the player playing the monster must then state what happens on the other side of the stakes, which is Ã¢â‚¬Å“my monster will squash the character and take all of his cards.Ã¢â‚¬Â<br/>After the IncrediblyKillerWeapon, a stake, is invoked through the setting of stakes, this stat may now by rolled along with the other stat in the coming conflict, and the result of the conflict is that which was set in the stakes.<br/><br/>Joshua - If you play this, you are my hero.<br/>Mike - Done.<br/>Larry - Enough wordplay?  Burnination added.                        </div>
