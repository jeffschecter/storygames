There are beads with a distinct color for each side in the conflict (always two-sided in MRG, I think). Opponents narrate their actions back and forth and everyone else is a spectator. Spectators toss a bead of the appropriate color into a bag when someone says something awesome. At the end, you draw a single bead and that player wins.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221813/#Comment_221813" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-31T10:03:30+00:00" title="July 31, 2009 10:03AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://open.crngames.com/src/inuma.html" rel="nofollow">Inuma</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Grant%20Davis" title="Grant Davis"><img alt="Grant Davis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Grant%20Davis">Grant Davis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221822/#Comment_221822" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-31T11:13:29+00:00" title="July 31, 2009 11:13AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's the core mechanic for my game Secrets and Lies.

I'll have a more thorough read through when I get more time.<br/>\n<br/>\nGrant, is there any point in which one player might have so much more resources, i.e. beads, than any other player that he is almost guaranteed to win every encounter?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea for using sortition in my first game Defiance came from blackballing. Which in turn came from some musing I had about how to play Dread if you didn't have Jenga. From there I wondered if instead of one specific bead being read as a disastrous result (equivalent of the Jeng tower falling in Dread) you could read<br/>\ncombinations of beads to mean different thing, e.g., success with a negative outcome or success with a positive outcome.<br/>\n<br/>\nDefiance is about insurrectionists in an 18th century European City that never existed.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy second game Radiance originally used d6 because I wanted something that most people could start playing straight away. I converted it to sortition when I decided it would be nice if people who were playing Defiance could also play Radiance using the same equipment. Radianc differs from Defiance in that Defiance sortition system is about characters taking actions and the consequence of those actions. While Radiance is about players using sortition to redirect the narrative and is much closer to blackballing, i.e., if you don't want to accept a redirection from another player, you make a draw, and if you draw a white bead you pass on narrative control to the player that suggested the redirection.<br/>\n<br/>\nRadiance is a game where focus of stories shifts away from the actions of specific characters and a more holistic approach is attempted.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Grant%20Davis" title="Grant Davis"><img alt="Grant Davis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Grant%20Davis">Grant Davis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222114/#Comment_222114" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-02T18:43:53+00:00" title="August  2, 2009  6:43PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Players are limited to the number of beads that they physically have. Also, for each new challenge they are usually limited by their skill level. Starting skill levels are usually 2, so no matter how many they have won previously, they start at 2 for the next challenge, then can draw for the beads they need to win. For challenges against other players, they can also draw for the beads they need.<br><br>As for what you can do with the extra beads: you allocate Discipline (beads) amongst several things: your job, suppressing desires, maintaining fitness, and skills such as Observation, Persuasion and Unobtrusiveness. If you can't maintain the allocation, then you put a bead of your color in the Consequence draw.  When the GM needs to move the action forward, he draws a bead (there are black beads that empty out the draw, so consequence is not inevitable). That may be the kind of sortition you had in mind.<br><br>-Grant                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222125/#Comment_222125" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-02T20:06:16+00:00" title="August  2, 2009  8:06PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The great thing about the wirework mechanic in Mist-Robed Gate is (almost every time I've played it)  that in most of the conflicts which had a wide disparity of votes, the person with the highest number of votes lost due to random chance. It's great, because the person who won is excited and the person who lost doesn't mind much. I realize it's a random thing, but it makes my experience of the game even better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
