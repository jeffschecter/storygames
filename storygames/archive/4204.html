No examples of play, though I might fill that fourth page with it.  <br/><br/>Thoughts?<br/><br/>RUSTY NAILS<br/>by Fred Hicks<br/><br/>[What You Need to Play]<br/><br/>A table with an uncluttered surface that everyone can sit around, evenly spaced with a decent amount of room to move.  Each player needs to be able to indicate all the other players by pointing, without it being ambiguous as to which player is indicated.<br/><br/>Each player needs a handful of NAILS, one for each player at the table.  The nails need to be large enough to be clearly seen from across the table, as they will be used as pointing devices.  The game will also need a pile of unallocated nails for use as play progresses.<br/><br/>Each player will need to have access to a handful of d4\xe2\u20ac\u2122s, d6\xe2\u20ac\u2122s, d8\xe2\u20ac\u2122s, d10\xe2\u20ac\u2122s, and d12\xe2\u20ac\u2122s.  A communal pool of these dice is fine.<br/><br/>Each will need a paper and pencil for recording characters and other notes for play.<br/><br/>Each player will need a WALL (barrier) for concealing what they are doing at their position around the table.  This barrier won\xe2\u20ac\u2122t always be up, but needs to be easily reached.  Possibilities include a \xe2\u20ac\u0153GM\xe2\u20ac\u2122s screen\xe2\u20ac\x9d, a hardcover game book, a folded sheet of paper.<br/><br/>[The Situation]<br/><br/>Before working up their characters, players should discuss the common situation for all their characters.  <br/><br/>Setting should be discussed early into this process.  It can be the far future, the distant past, a fantasy world, our modern mundane world, whatever works for everyone and excites folks at the table.    <br/><br/>Players are going to be creating and playing characters who are haunted by their past \xe2\u20ac\u201c a past which is catching up with them.  When creating the situation these characters find themselves in, an eye should be kept on making these things true:<br/><br/>-\tAn element of distrust exists among the characters. . . <br/>-\t. . . but circumstances compel them to work together, or at least remain in each other\xe2\u20ac\u2122s company.<br/>-\tOTHER STUFF I HAVEN\xe2\u20ac\u2122T FIGURED OUT YET<br/><br/>[Character Creation]<br/><br/>After the basics of the situation are established, it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s time to create characters.  (This can be done after setting but before situation is determined, if you want the situation to emerge from the character creation process, rather than the other way around.)<br/><br/>Everyone should put up their WALL.  Behind the wall, each player uses the nails he has on hand to indicate the other players at the table by laying them on the table, behind the wall, with the head of the nail towards him and the point of the nail towards the targeted player.  Each player must point one nail at every other player, but should have one nail left over to point at a player of their choice.  Inasmuch as a strategy exists here, the player one chooses to point the most nails at is the one most put \xe2\u20ac\u0153on the spot\xe2\u20ac\x9d.<br/><br/>Once everyone has placed their nails, the WALLS come down.  Each player should then tally the number of nails pointed at him.  This total is called his DRIVE, and should be written down on his character sheet.  Everyone should have at least a drive equal to the number of other players at the table, and several will have a few points more than that.  Each point of drive indicates one aspect of his past, from which he draws strength to get a job done, and which complicates his life with trials and tribulations.  <br/><br/>At this point, each player writes down a word, phrase, or sentence for each point of DRIVE, each on a separate line.  These should be expressed out loud to the table, creating a picture of the character\xe2\u20ac\u2122s past, capabilities, and foibles.  These are the character\xe2\u20ac\u2122s HAMMERS.<br/><br/>Once this is done, each player takes a turn being the focus of the rest of the table\xe2\u20ac\u2122s attention.  Going round-robin, each player indicates one of the HAMMERS (that has not been indicated before) and gives it a die rating: d4, d6, d8, d10, or d12.  This is a progression from weakness to strength, but is both negative and positive.  That is to say, a d4 hammer does not give the character a lot of capability, but it also doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t complicate his life very much.  A d12 hammer means the character is very effective, but also dogged by constant complication and downfall.  Players rating another PC\xe2\u20ac\u2122s hammers are encouraged to rate them according to how vivid, \xe2\u20ac\u0153strong\xe2\u20ac\x9d, painful, forceful, or intense the hammer feels, but any philosophy may be applied here.<br/><br/>Once this is done, leave the nails on the table pointed at the people they\xe2\u20ac\u2122re pointed at.  The orientation and number of nails will be important during play, and will change in ways that are significant to the story.  That said, at this point the character\xe2\u20ac\u2122s DRIVE is locked in, even if the number of nails pointed at him changes.<br/><br/>[Rolling the Dice]<br/><br/>Play then proceeds starting with the character with the most DRIVE, in a freeform fashion, with everyone at the table participating.  At various points a player will have to roll his dice, when a stressful moment or difficult choice confronts his character.  It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s up to the folks at the table to call upon him to make a roll.  The player called upon to roll is called the TARGET.  He must roll all of the dice made available to him by his HAMMERS.<br/> <br/>Any die rolled that shows a 4 or higher generates a POINT.  POINTS may be spent to narrate small, concrete details about what happens (think of POINTS as discrete units of change and momentum moving towards an incremental resolution).  If no POINTS result, special circumstances apply, which will be covered later.<br/><br/>POINTS are spent starting with the player who rolled the dice (the TARGET).  POINTS are always spent one at a time.  Whenever a POINT is spent, the die that created that point must be picked up by the player who spends the point, moved into his POOL, which we\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll talk about shortly.  (It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s to the TARGET\xe2\u20ac\u2122s advantage to claim the dice with the largest number of sides here, and the structure of play is such that the TARGET has the best chance of getting more than one die into his POOL if he has a larger DRIVE than the number of players.)<br/><br/>The TARGET goes first, starting a new chain of events by spending a single point and making a declarative statement (with the focus on small and concrete detail) about what happens.  If points remain, play passes to the left and progresses round-robin, with each player (called the SPEAKER on his turn) gaining the option to spend one of the points and add clauses onto the target\xe2\u20ac\u2122s statement (see below).  What clauses are allowed depend on how many nails the player spending the point has pointed at the target.  If the player has no nails pointed at the target, he may not spend a point and participate in the narration.  <br/><br/>Nails SPEAKER has pointed at TARGET\tClause Allowed<br/>0\tNone.  You must pass.<br/>1\t\xe2\u20ac\u0153Yes, and\xe2\u20ac\xa6\xe2\u20ac\x9d (Elaboration)<br/>2\t\xe2\u20ac\u0153Yes, but\xe2\u20ac\xa6\xe2\u20ac\x9d (Complication)<br/>3 or more\t\xe2\u20ac\u0153No.  Instead\xe2\u20ac\xa6\xe2\u20ac\x9d (Contradiction)<br/><br/>The SPEAKER may always choose a \xe2\u20ac\u0153lesser\xe2\u20ac\x9d clause; the table above indicates the maximum authority he has to react to the statement.  Due to the supply of points, the person to the TARGET\xe2\u20ac\u2122s immediate right is least likely to get a chance to spend a point, unless some of the previous speakers pass.  Play must progress until all points are spent, at which point the situation is fully resolved, or another roll of the dice is in order.<br/><br/>[more in next post]                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94201/#Comment_94201" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-09T12:47:00+00:00" title="September  9, 2007 12:47PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If no POINTS result at all from a roll, the player may talk about how the situation isn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t resolved, but sheds light on the other characters around the table.  The player may then reallocate his nails that are pointing outward in light of this.  (This means that characters with a lot of d4s have a greater chance of being able to change how their nails point, a lower chance of being able to change how nails are pointing at them, and a lower chance of having more nails pointed at them.)<br/><br/>When all POINTS are spent, if the TARGET is the only one who spent POINTS, then skip the rest of this process and return to normal play.<br/><br/>If two or more players have a small POOL of dice in hand, thanks to claiming the dice when narrating, each player with dice in their POOL rolls these dice again.  The player who scores the most POINTS on this second roll gets to take an action (see below); if more than one player scores the same number of POINTS, the highest single die value (ties are discarded) showing gets to take the action.  If nothing but ties exist, then no action is taken.<br/><br/>If the TARGET is the winner, he may remove one nail pointed at him, so long as the nail is removed from one of the players who acted as a SPEAKER (i.e., from one of the players who also had a POOL to roll).  The TARGET may make a brief statement about how his story is moving further towards a conclusion.<br/><br/>If one of the SPEAKERS is the winner, he may add a nail, pointed at the TARGET.  The SPEAKER may make a brief statement about how the TARGET\xe2\u20ac\u2122s story has no end in sight.<br/><br/>[Conclusion]<br/><br/>If a player ever manages to remove all the nails pointed at him, then his character\xe2\u20ac\u2122s story comes to an end.  He has full authority to describe how this happens, though optionally, he may roll all of his dice, and a round-robin expenditure of POINTS may proceed, as if everyone had a single nail pointed at him, allowing them to add elaboration (\xe2\u20ac\u0153Yes, and\xe2\u20ac\x9d) clauses to his story.<br/><br/>Even with his character\xe2\u20ac\u2122s story at an end, that player should continue to participate in play if he is still the source of \xe2\u20ac\u0153outbound\xe2\u20ac\x9d nails.  With his character out of the picture, he may even become more merciless if he\xe2\u20ac\u2122s in a position to exercise the more potent clauses (\xe2\u20ac\u0153Yes, but\xe2\u20ac\x9d, \xe2\u20ac\u0153No, instead\xe2\u20ac\x9d).   <br/><br/>[Free Associations]<br/><br/>These are free associations I did when I looked at my three chosen ingredients.

You place it before explaining how follow-up dice offs work - with people who have pools rolling dice and if you win you get to remove a nail.<br/>2.) And... how does it have a lower chance of having more nails pointed at them? I thought it would have the opposite - a lower chance of having more nails removed, because you're less likely to gain enough Points to have dice offs with opponents (read: enough Points for opponents to get Pools).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94265">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94265/#Comment_94265" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-09T19:18:46+00:00" title="September  9, 2007  7:18PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            People with more d4s are going to roll fewer points.  <br/><br/>People who roll <i>no points</i> can rearrange how their <i>outbound</i> nails point.<br/><br/>People who roll one point will not cause their <i>inbound</i> nail count to change.<br/><br/>People who roll two or more points will have a shot at reducing the number of <i>inbound</i> nails are pointing at them, but other people will have a shot at increasing the number of inbound nails.<br/><br/>Each d4 only has a 25% chance of generating a point.  If someone has, say, d6 d4 d4 as the dice in their drive, they've got a decent chance at getting a point.  If they get two points, they'll likely take the d6 when they make their opening statement, with the other guys taking the d4s when they add their clauses.

I'd love to hear more about how you free associate, anecdotally.</blockquote>\nSure.<br/><br/>Free association usually starts one or more seeds -- contest criteria being one example, though in DRYH's case it was an NPR story and my love for Midnight Nation.  I don't necessarily free-associate in any "formal" way.  Sometimes it's in my head, sometimes it's with a notepad of paper or electronic form.  In this case, I opened up the word file -- looking at the sight component of the game I'd already hit on the "rusty nails" title, so that was in the back of my head.  I put that at the top and listed the components and then went about my daily business with those three bits banging around in the back of my brain.  <br/><br/>I find a certain amount of deliberate distraction is crucial for getting a good free association going on; I'll follow predictable paths if I do it too consciously.  Every time I had a concept (or more often, concepts) happen, I went back to the file and got the stuff written down.  Any time my fingers caught up with my brain and I paused at the keys, I went back to do other things.  It's not about contemplation at this stage of the process; it's about putting a lot of stuff into the pot and letting it simmer, so I can eventually smell what's cooking.<br/><br/>Eventually that gave me a "palette" of related concepts and phrases that was broad enough to hit a critical mass and start to suggest themes and (sometimes more important to me) at-the-table power dynamics.  I got a vivid sense of the nails/grave-markers as pointers, pointing at people who were on the spot (or dead).   The running sound had definitely given me a kind of thready, panicky feel -- something that I particularly like in my games -- and with the nail motif emerging I knew I wanted the game to be about <i>evading</i> those nails, with other people trying to <i>nail you down</i>.   I'm probably weakest on my connection to the word "scour" in this, but I feel like the act of trying to get rid of those inbound nails and bring your story to a conclusion is connected to the feeling and spirit of "scour" without necessarily having a straight-line connection to its meaning.<br/><br/>I don't think I'd quite connected that idea together with the notion of someone's "outbound nails" being expressions of how much narrative authority they had over each indicated player -- that emerged as I was writing the game.  I knew I wanted the potential for "unbalanced stats", in the sense that not everyone around the table would have the same DRIVE, but I also wanted that imbalance not to matter quite so much -- much like with DRYH, having more oomph to your dice is both more powerful and more troubling at the same time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94335/#Comment_94335" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-10T09:00:51+00:00" title="September 10, 2007  9:00AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So I've been thinking a bit more, and there are a few notes I want to get down here since I'm away from the computer the file's on, today.<br/><br/>[Concerns about Endgame]<br/><br/>Right now, a character's endgame is tied to getting rid of all the nails pointed at him.  On the one hand, this works, because it means a character's story may conclude when he is able to exercise maximum authority over his story -- with no inbound nails, no one can change or add anything, so it's up to him to have the last word.  This says to me that the story for that character ends when his player is able to tell the end he <i>most wants</i>.  There's no value judgment here -- the story the player most wants for his character could be about his dude getting gunned down mercilessly, or it could be about ascending to be king.  I feel like that freedom's a good thing... I think.<br/><br/>I'm wondering though if there should be another kind of endgame, when a player is at <i>minimum authority</i>.  The clearest expression of this in play would be when every player has at least three nails pointing at the character, meaning that EVERYONE around the table can outright contradict any assertion made about your dude.  And that for me is a situation where your story ends, but you have no authorship in it: in my mind, these connect to the sad and sudden ends we see in some particularly heartbreaking storytelling.<br/><br/>Looking at the dynamics here, let's look at a 3 player game.  On average, each player will start out with a total of three nails pointed at him, though the starting range should run from 2 to 4.  It'll take a minimum of three conflicts which end in the final roll going a particular way for the character to progress either to "I have no inbound nails" or "I have 2 players each with 3 nails pointed at me."  That's not too bad, as I expect there to be a mix of wins and losses that make the nail dynamics shuttle back and forth.  And there's at least some apparent validation in suggesting the nothing-but-3+-nails as the other exit condition works pretty well, since there's the same "distance", mechanically speaking, to that endgame result.  It means that the system encourages created characters to be placed at the dead center of things.  This is good.<br/><br/>[What sort of game this system gives you]<br/><br/>There's something in the back of my head that says to me, this is a game that could produce <i>Once Upon a Time in the West</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94375/#Comment_94375" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-10T10:58:24+00:00" title="September 10, 2007 10:58AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [Multi-PC "Conflicts"]<br/><br/>Right now the system only really covers a single player rolling his big handful of dice and folks around the table messing with what he has to say.  I've been toying with various ways to let multiple PCs get their dice into the mix.  Right now I'm a fan of anyone who's directly involved in the "conflict" (I'm using quotes around conflict because it's not necessarily about clear, defined conflict, so much as a moment of choice or high stress) rolling their dice.  That said, more than one TARGET in action means that there's some complications to how things could play out.<br/><br/>First off, I want to review the single TARGET situation.  In this, every time it comes around to the TARGET's turn, he gets to make a declarative statement, establishing some finite, concrete detail about what happens, spending a point to do so; then everyone else around the table gets a shot at his remaining points, acting as SPEAKERS that add clauses to modify the TARGET's statement.  I've sort of casually referred to this target statement + speaker clauses process as a "chain"; let me make that CHAIN, to formalize the term for this bit.<br/><br/>So here's the deal.  When you have multiple concurrent TARGETs, then each TARGET is also a SPEAKER, and that might mean there are multiple CHAINS active at the same time.  My inclination is to be fine with the multiple CHAINs happening at the same time, but I'm worried that that'll be a tracking-headache.  <br/><br/>So the second perspective is that either TARGET can effectively accept what's happened so far with the other TARGET's CHAIN by starting a new CHAIN; in other words, the rule becomes, there is only ever one active CHAIN at a time.  <br/><br/>So suppose the folks at the table are seated in an order A, B, C, D.  A and C end up as the TARGETs.  A starts a CHAIN, and B acts as SPEAKER to put a clause on it.  C could either start a CHAIN or act as SPEAKER to put a clause on A's chain.  If C starts a CHAIN, then A's CHAIN is ended, and D has no shot at putting a clause on it.<br/><br/>Since, ultimately, both A and C are going to have to remain active TARGETs until all of their points have been spent, I think this is reasonably organic, so right now I think this is how I want to see it play.<br/><br/>Then, there's the use of the dice folks have claimed as a part of spending points.  I don't want folks to have to keep separate pools on a per-TARGET basis, so I think a unified roll-off happens here.  The top two (or three, or more, depending on the number of TARGETs) folks in points get to take an action (nail removal if they're one of the TARGETs, nail placement if they're one of the SPEAKERS).  If there's a tie in points, then the top two die values take it (it's always possible that the top two values are held by the same person; that's fine by me, so long as a TARGET only removes one nail maximum -- all the rest will have to be as nail placements).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
