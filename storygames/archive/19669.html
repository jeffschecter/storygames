Because when GMing I've often been asked at conventions how the rules of a game work and I always consider it a good question. In fact, teaching how the rules of a game work is something I obsessively do in convention play and it is not considered offputting or odd. And as a player, I always ask how the rules work and I always get a decent answer (at least, when the answer has been deficient it hasn't been for social reasons, it's been because the GM/group leader didn't quite understand the rules themselves.) <br/><br/>Like, I do occasionally get a bit of ribbing from people who laugh when I say "Hi everyone, I'm Jason and today we're going to play a game called Dungeons and Dragons, here's how the game works. My role is called 'the DM' and my job is..." but I probably get a far greater number of thank yous from people who, even though they may have "already known" how to play the game, they appreciated the refresher or (for games with a lot of flexibility) what my approach was going to be.<br/><br/>So can people share stories of times when this is considered a faux pas or somehow socially transgressive, to ask how a game works that you are sitting down to play?                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436847/#Comment_436847" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-10T13:15:07+00:00" title="August 10, 2014  1:15PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There\u2019s no problem asking about how an attack against AC work or how many spell slots you get back as an evoker or stuff like that.

To be specific, I remember having shaken the confidence of a few less experienced GMs when I've insisted on dragging the specific degree of illusion involved in the game out into daylight. One experienced GM was also less than enamoured by a similar event. I don't make a hobby of such, but I think I can remember about three distinct cases over the last decade where a GM has treated questions about their activities as socially transgressive. I've only gotten this reaction with GMs who actually have something to hide, which of course makes a fair bit of sense. And everybody is of course only too happy to explain the "player-facing" parts of the game when asked.<br/><br/>Overall I would not call this a social standard considering the number of GM's I've talked with vs. the number of those bothered by such questions; rather, it's a strain of thought within the tabletop rpg tradition that one occasionally encounters. It should be noted that regular illusionists are a narrow minority of the roleplayers in my regular circles, which obviously skews the results here - I've interviewed more GMs I've trained myself than GMs of the Nordic freeform tradition combined, for example <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>(To be explicit, I'm not saying that these GMs are wrong to be annoyed: if your method is to limit information to retain mystery like a stage magician, then of course you don't want to answer questions about it. I've yet to encounter a GM who would calmly say such, of course - for some reason the first instinct is to lie rather than say that the game'll be more enjoyable if you don't know.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436856/#Comment_436856" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-10T13:37:30+00:00" title="August 10, 2014  1:37PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with everyone so far!  The first time you sit down with a new GM, it's like eating in a restaurant you've never eaten in before.  You don't know how the chef <i>here</i> prepares their version of a "Shepherd's Pie".  It can be SO different from place to place, it's hard to not feel like some people should just invent a new name for it.<br/><br/>So in that sense, you can't really expect total clarity until after you've played a session.  I also agree that it's very subjective and depends a lot on how and when the question is asked.  Tone can matter.<br/><br/>But I think expecting "fairness" is a slippery semantic slope.  It needs unpacking.  Some people interpret fairness as "the GM will never tell a lie to you", some as "the GM will treat your creative input just as they treat their own", some as "the GM will not try to kill your character", while others simply see it as "the GM will treat all Players equally".  Certainly that last one is more universally expected than the others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436857/#Comment_436857" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-10T13:39:22+00:00" title="August 10, 2014  1:39PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I think it can appear rude if the one asked reads it as you sniping at the game and wanting to find details to pick at and criticize.</blockquote>\nExactly.<br/><br/>Yeah, there\u2019s also a lot of nerves and tension with being GM, some people feel like they really put themselves out there and don\u2019t want their hard work (be it sandbox prep or path prep) to be in vain.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436858/#Comment_436858" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-10T13:46:58+00:00" title="August 10, 2014  1:46PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I've only gotten this reaction with GMs who actually have something to hide, which of course makes a fair bit of sense.</blockquote>\nThat\u2019s not my only experience. I really pushed the limit (in email correspondence) with one GM trying to find out his degree of sandboxness vs illusion and it turned out he was squeaky clean and on the level. Kind of burned a few of the bridges with him but... hopefully I still can get in a game with him because he is a brilliant GM.<br/>(Rickard, I am talking about Anth here.)<br/><br/>Just goes to show that even these GMs more than raise an eyebrow when trying to figure out the style.<br/><br/>I have another GM in my past, Martin who was very secretive about whether he was running a sandboxy set up, a rail, illusion, or wholly improvised. I suspect a mix. I know that he spent a lot of time on prep.<br/>I was very interested in discussing prep and GM techniques with him but he was very secretive and, above all, he did not want to know to what extent my own GMing at the time was improvised (which it was \u2014 I\u2019d think of ideas before hand but it was all inside my head) since he wanted to fully immerse himself in my games.<br/><br/>So I say yes, there are a lot of potentials for faux pas in this regard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436859/#Comment_436859" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-10T13:47:46+00:00" title="August 10, 2014  1:47PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The problem is that way too may GMs think that "surprise" is an important game element and try to keep it even from before the start of the game. And the worst of it is that they apply that concept at some of the game mechanics. <a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">@Deliverator</a>, in your example it's easy to read that answer as "I'm going to surprise you later with that part, it's part of my act and if you're prepared for it, it won't have the same effect"<br/><br/>But then again, that GM isn't realizing that anyone can interpretate from that answer that there's a hidden agenda. Once a player takes note of this fact, the social contract is changed in his mind and now this game has another level: "you have a hidden agenda and I'm going to find out what it is either to help you or act against it if I don't like it." Add to that any judgement the player can make about that person a priori (he's hiding something from me and I don't like it / I like a GM with the guts to lie in my face, let's play) and the gameplay will go either the powergaming or the collaborationist way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436861">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436861/#Comment_436861" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-10T13:55:55+00:00" title="August 10, 2014  1:55PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Considering it further, saying that only illusionist GMs react negatively to queries about their system is a bit exaggerated - as has been noted, perceived criticism also plays a big part. It matters whether you're asking because you want to learn their excellent style, or whether you're accusing them of cheating with the dice, for example. Both are sort of "asking about how the game works", but the intent is completely different.<br/><br/>Let me rephrase my experience: given an equally amiable social context, the GM who is loath to explain their method has in my experience been concerned about the asymmetry of player perception and the "ugly underworks" of the game. The one experienced GM I truly managed to piss off in this regard didn't want to ruin the post facto interpretation of their session by revealing how much of the content had been pre-planned vs. how much was spontaneously initiated by player choices, for example. This was sort of understandable in that the events surely felt cooler for the players who bought into the idea that they'd initiated them themselves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436865/#Comment_436865" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-10T14:03:43+00:00" title="August 10, 2014  2:03PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Finding out that some of the coolest things had been our unexpected interactions with objects and items that were in the dungeons as written was so awesome.

Especially if there are time constraints. The GM and other players at the table might want to stay away from that meta-level of discussion too, while the game is running. Like running the commentary track on a DVD, to come back to that comparsion, it can distract from the experience you originally showed up for. No matter how informative it is, some would say it is best to see the film first. And I would respect the wish of the other players (including the GM) to table a discussion on technique till the game is done.

However, I once got into a discussion with a player where I explained that a game we recently finished was generated largely in response to player action, and the person expressed their disenchantment - they felt that preplanned content was different from improvised-on-the-fly content because in the first case they were discovering something that already existed. (I suppose in a way this is about retaining player agency and consequences in failure as well as success. This was an investigation, a genre in which one is generally supposed to be discovering events that happened before.)<br/><br/>So if you were their player, I would not surprised if some GMs were hesitant about answering your questions because perhaps they also had a similar experience and wanted to avoid an answer that you would dislike (and if the "how I create material for games" was not a part of the same page discussion beforehand - I don't think it generally is). However, talking to GMs you don't currently play with and not getting an answer would be weird.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436942">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/twilight" title="twilight"><img alt="twilight" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/twilight">twilight</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436942/#Comment_436942" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-11T11:14:21+00:00" title="August 11, 2014 11:14AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 11, 2014 11:15AM by twilight.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My experiences usually stem from GMs or players trying to emulate a particular established setting. When I last played in a Star Wars campaign, for example, I had to ask questions to establish not only what my character knew but what I "should" know. The GM was a Star Wars fanatic and watched, read and breathed the setting; my fanaticism remained mostly with the movies, the old Knights of the Old Republic video games and not much else. So, when he said, "This is the Old Republic," that was really vague. When I asked about Force capabilities, was I allowed to be creative or limited to a mode of thinking? How about the Jedi Code? This translated to other games: Forgotten Realms? Which books and characters are present? Dragonlance, Dragon Age and Mass Effect settings have a similar level of setting related understanding.<br/><br/>While it may seem antagonistic or, at least, a measuring contest, as a player, I also don't want to ruin the GM's and group's experience. If an NPC is hiding behind crates, sniping at PCs, the last thing I want to hear is that it is un-Jedi like to push the crates and pin the NPC to the wall. While the former never came up in play, I have had a player turn to me on one occasion and say, "A Jedi wouldn't do that." Which led to me asking, "Eh?" Then citation from player followed by citations from GM brought the game to a halt for a quarter of the session. By which time I had already bowed to their considerable knowledge and waited my turn to affirm that I'm still doing what I said I was doing. While I used to scoff at first sessions as pitch sessions, my latest experiences demonstrate why they're beneficial: get a broad stroke agreement on what the setting is then build from there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436945/#Comment_436945" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-11T11:49:23+00:00" title="August 11, 2014 11:49AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 11, 2014 11:49AM by catty_big.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            IMO it's completely <i>not</i> a faux pas not to assume any system knowledge, as your players will likely come from many different roleplaying backgrounds (storygames, adventure path games etc.) and many different levels of experience with specific systems, and indeed with roleplaying in general.

But with a more careful reading of the OP, I think JD's question is really about the <i>second</i> part of the quote, in which Deliverator's exact words were <i>"the rules of the game".</i>  JD's verbage seems to support that reading, so now I assume this refers to the RAW, not the GM's personal body of technique or anything about the module.  <br/><br/>In that case, asking how the <i>game</i> works is perfectly natural behavior for a person considering any kind of game ever, and the optimal answer is "Have a seat, I'm just about to show everyone."  Of course if play has already begun, if you're interrupting someone, breaking anyone's immersion, wasting group time, throwing people off with your question, etc, that's just rude.  You should probably save it til there's a break, or til your turn comes up.<br/><br/>So...<br/>1. Total clarity, while nice, cannot necessarily be expected until having played.

Maybe one out of eight games were like this.<br/><br/>And in those adversarial games, it was definitely not cool if you asked the GM about anything complicated or unusual, because the assumption was that <i>any</i> information the GM had would be used against everyone. So if you wondered whether a particular combination of spells could, for example, make killing a dragon easy, you kept that shit quiet until you could have a sidebar with one of the other players to work out the details. Under no circumstances could the GM hear even a whisper of it until you were ready to uncork your diabolically convoluted and torturously detailed plan, because if he did, you would expect that every dragon in the universe would already have prepared a defense against it. Accidentally revealing a plan to the GM in advance was the kind of thing that would definitely put you on the rest of the group's shit list until you found a brilliant way to make it up to them.<br/><br/>But that was a very specific kind of D&amp;D game, and it wasn't even the kind that we played most often. If the GM didn't say up front that he was going to kill the hell out of everyone and we'd all better be ready for that, we didn't need to play everything so close to the vest. A well-timed surprising plan would always be welcomed, but if you reality-checked it with the GM and the rest of the group in advance it wouldn't be a big deal, and the GMs generally stuck with "the bad guys only know the things the bad guys know, not everything the GM knows."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436963">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436963/#Comment_436963" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-11T23:36:48+00:00" title="August 11, 2014 11:36PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I think it depends a lot how, when, and where it's asked.<br/><br/>Tom: Hey wanna play in a game I'm running this Saturday?<br/>Dick: Maybe, what is it?<br/>Tom: Generic high fantasy rpg.<br/>Dick: What's the table style?

If it's a complicated Fantasy Flight Games product then this usually includes me making several exasperated comments about how poorly their book is organized and how they should hire an editor.<br/><br/>Given that story-games is mostly people who Care How Games Work, I imagine I am not the only one in this conversation who is good at this. I am often worried that this role makes me kind of an asshole but I think it is worth it because learning new games is hard. But it's especially so because I know that if I sit down with people who have played a game before there is a good chance that when I ask how the game works they will get flustered an defensive. Because explaining rules is a challenging thing, and the skill that I have has come from really working on it and thinking about it a lot, and running lots of games for strangers and giving little spiels about how the rules work that are quick and efficient and informative and sometimes amusing even when you've heard them and I get a lot of practice.<br/><br/>People are embarrassed that things are hard to explain, because it's a kind of public speaking and it is scary. Of course house rules make that way worse (and don't get me started on people who house rule a FFG boardgame after playing it one time without thinking through the full repercussions).<br/><br/>So: I ask for a quick introduction to the game, but I know that it is ultimately less disruptive to ask someone to pass me the rules rather than asking them to explain something, unless they are a person who has already demonstrated a certain ease.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I love leading games because I actually love explaining rules to people and entertaining their questions, especially inventive ones or ones that approach the text from a different direction than I am used to, or when things suddenly click in the mind of a new player and they double-check that things are actually really neat. It is one of the best things about games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437193/#Comment_437193" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-13T17:49:26+00:00" title="August 13, 2014  5:49PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>And, y'know, there are people I know who have said things at parties or in forum threads to the effect of "I don't use the written rules that much," and I know not to play with them.

I can't say I've ever seen a lot of discussion about GMing approach, although sometimes the GM will announce up-front that they "basically run freeform (as in rules-less), maybe roll a die if something's in the balance." Some might be happy to talk about their GMing style more in-depth (especially at the after-party), but the last time I went to a Con was as I was only just breaking into the theory side of things.<br/><br/>I've played in a lot of games that were advertised as Systemless, which could be anything from "listen to the GM tell you a story" to full-on collaborative freeform. I've also played in a game of Dragon Warriors (run by a guy whose material's been published by them) where I don't remember doing much with the mechanics apart from maybe an occasional skill roll while getting dragged along by his "plot". I played in a game of Feng Shui where, despite having full Character Sheets, the GM completely winged it without dice because he said it was "more fun" that way.<br/><br/>For games advertised as running under a particular system, If I were to ask how the mechanics actually worked, I'd tend to get deflective responses about preferring to run the game freeform - and I believe this is because people think the rules take too long to explain, and there seems to be a general preference for "pure roleplaying" rather than mechanical bean-counting of any sort (apart from D&amp;D/Pathfinder, which I don't play at Cons).<br/><br/>It was a little disappointing to say the least, since I was trying to play a range of games to increase my breadth of understanding of new systems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Is asking about how a game works a "faux pas"? - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19669/is-asking-about-how-a-game-works-a-faux-pas/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content='Is asking about how a game works a "faux pas"? - Page 2' itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19669/is-asking-about-how-a-game-works-a-faux-pas/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="That is just bizarre!
