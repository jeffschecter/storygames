It's our movie. I'm the one paying for the film, so I get the final say, but the movie is unquestionably a collaboration.<br/><br/>It helps when you have a game system that has an in-game way of rewarding players. Any game with an analog of HEX's Style Points lends itself to GM-imposed constraints. By awarding Style Points, I can easily compensate the player for the fact that I've constrained his options, and I can reward the player for helping fulfill my vision. <br/><br/>It gets a little harder to do this sort of thing in a game like Unknown Armies, my favorite RPG. UA is modern horror. It's a gritty system that gives players few perks, so there's not much of an in-game reward I can give a UA player for her cooperation. To sell this kind of stunt in UA, I have to rely more on my authority as GM. In practice, that authority comes from the players' trust in me, which of course is something I have to earn. Still, I probably sound more like a dictator when I'm running a UA game than when I'm running a HEX game.<br/><br/>I think that difference between HEX and UA is part of the reason that my UA games have far more structure than my HEX games. Players still have a lot of freedom in my UA games, but their responses tend to be more predictable than the responses of players in a HEX game. That predictability may make the adventure feel as if everything is scripted, when in reality it's not.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>Do any players have difficulty with "pretend you don't know that"? I've seen some players get uncomfortably (for them) distant from their characters in similar situations.</blockquote>\nI haven't seen this at my table. I use this kind of GM fiat sparingly -- no more than once per adventure, and not at all in the majority of my adventures. If it were overdone, I imagine GM fiat would get old fast, no matter what the GM's intent. GM fiat is like pepper -- you have to know when to apply it and in what quantity. But used well (and shamelessly), it can be very effective.<br/><br/>- Todd                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344957/#Comment_344957" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-05T16:59:54+00:00" title="October  5, 2011  4:59PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this is not railroading but a "creative constraint".

I really do think of myself as the director. The audience doesn't see the director (with exceptions -- yes, I'm looking at you, Mr. Shyamalan), so the primary way he gains the audience's appreciation is by bringing out the best in his actors so he can tell the best story he can. That's my job.\n<blockquote>I'm curious if there's anything in the HEX system that helps.

Rather, I learned that lesson from the Buffy the Vampire Slayer RPG by Eden Studios. Buffy was a rather angsty series. The RPG rulebook did a superb job of capturing the feel of the source material. It contained great advice on how to reward the players, with its analog of Style Points, for having their characters suffer imposed adversity -- regardless of whether the adversity was imposed by the GM or by player herself. If I recall, that section of the rulebook was called "When Bad Things Happen to Good People." I'd refer you there for concrete procedural help. I don't recall if the advice was immediately accessible to someone who isn't familiar with the TV series.<br/><br/>In the interest of full disclosure, I frequently forget some of the criteria for awarding Style Points. That's why, at the start of the session, after I explain to the players how to earn Style Points, I ask them to remind me if they fulfill any of those criteria.\n<blockquote>Random thought: do you think it would dramatically change how your HEX game plays if<i>players</i>could award each other Style Points from a central bank?

Truth be told, I'm not comfortable with it. My fear is that if a player starts currying the favor of another player rather than my favor, the coherence of the story will suffer. That's a big deal to me.<br/><br/>My discomfort is probably also related to the fact that I'm a confessed control freak. I'm sure that says volumes about me. Nolo contendere.<br/><br/>Aside: Away from the game table, I used to jokingly describe myself as a "subtle tyrant" when I GMed. I stopped when two people who often played at my table challenged me on the "subtle" part.

We all have to play to our strengths and weaknesses.  I'd be wary of player-managed awarding too in a game where I had a Plan.<br/><br/>The main reason I brought it up has to do with the process of turning My Plan into Our Plan.<br/><br/>I played a cinematic action game a while back (hack of d20 BESM) where we got points for gratuitously stylish action.  "Why turn around and shoot someone when you can do a flip and shoot them in midair instead?"  In this game, the award criteria were so clear, and the point values so simple (1 point per narration), that anyone could have given out the points.  I think handing the awarding to the players would have been a pure plus: our GM would have had more brain space for other things, and we players would have been more vocal in recognizing each other's cool play.<br/><br/>Then there was a Pitfighter game I ran in college where I used XP awards mainly to enforce my vision of the tenor of play.  Bonuses for jokes at good moments, penalties for jokes that broke a serious vibe or threatened plausibility.  There was no possible way for the players to know what was going to earn them what (at least not until they got to know my GM style <i>really</i> well), so I <i>had</i> to do the awarding.<br/><br/>So, what I'm wondering is, when you talk about compensating players for imposed constraints, and how it feels like cooperation rather than coercion+bribery, how crucial is the award logic?  Are the players clear on why they're being rewarded, and does this reinforce what they know about the purpose of play (like my BESM game)?  Or is the purpose of play locked up inside your brain where the players can merely guess at it (like my Pitfighter game)?<br/><br/>The former sounds more repeatable to me.  It was trivially easy in my BESM game, but I could see it being more complicated where the award criteria are more open.  If you remember any good techniques from Buffy, please do share!  But if you don't actually use them, then I'm more curious about what you do.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>-David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345124">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345124/#Comment_345124" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-06T23:43:06+00:00" title="October  6, 2011 11:43PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 6, 2011 11:46PM by David_Berg.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            More from <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=15158&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">the GM pre-play thread</a>:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Will GM for Food</cite>"The fourth way to earn Style Points starts with me saying something like this: 'Ann, I'm giving you two Style Points for what I'm about to do to your character.' " The players usually laugh at this point. "Whatever I say after that cannot be avoided. Trust me that whatever it is, its sole purpose is to make a better movie."<br/><br/>I've used this technique to have characters get caught in traps, get knocked out, fall down holes, have their weapons jam, fall victims to mind control, all sorts of stuff. Most, but not all, of these obstacles are made up on the fly. (That's why I'm not sure this belongs in the "GM pre-play" conversation, because they're rarely planned.)

"You trusted me and look, I made good fiction with your character, and now you're in a good position to play on."  <br/><br/>Do you think that's it?  <br/><br/>I can't imagine that the Style Points themselves are the key, unless you award the players sufficient Points to nullify whatever you've inflicted on them.  I do see how the awarding serves a social role -- "I haven't forgotten we're cooperating here!" -- but that looks like a very small piece of this puzzle to me.<br/><br/>Here's where I'm coming from:<br/><br/>My great failure with trying this has been that it ruins a player's ability to invest in advocating for their character.

But since the most important one is subjective, I can't guarantee it's crystal clear.<br/><br/>For those playing along at home, these are the four criteria I use for awarding Style Points in a HEX game:\n<ul>\n<li>You can earn a Style Point for playing your character's Motivation, which is written at the top of your character sheet.<br/></li><li>You can earn a Style Point for playing one of your character's Flaws in such a way that it affects the game.<br/></li><li>You can earn a Style Point for making a good movie. This is the subjective one. Anything that pleasantly surprises or entertains me fits the bill. Also, in this year's scenario, the players were given the assignment to focus on action and keep the audience on the edge of their seats, so they got Style Points for that, too. It's easy to figure out if you're adding action to the movie. I try to give examples of things that keep an audience on the edge of their seats (cliffhangers, when you accept failure for your character, when you the player decide to put your character at a disadvantage), but it's hardly an exhaustive list. Besides, players who know only traditional games understand every word I'm uttering here, but don't usually grasp my meaning, even with examples. ("But why would I want to do that? He must mean something else.") So this is the most nebulous of the four.<br/></li><li>When I say "Take a Style Point for what I'm about to do to your character."<br/></li></ul>\nA variation of that same list comes straight out of the pages of the Buffy RPG. Plus Buffy has one more: You can earn the analog of a Style Point by creating a subplot. In Buffy, that's really just a specific example of the more general "put your character at a disadvantage."\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>I wonder if it really is as simple as a GM:<br/>1) showing up with a goal to make a good fiction ("adventure movie", etc.)<br/>2) announcing that they will inflict unavoidable fates on your character toward that goal<br/>3) proving early on that they are in fact good at making the good fiction<br/>4) and then saying "trust me" and<br/>5) delivering what they've promised.

For example, in HEX, it's fairly difficult to kill a PC, so character survivability isn't much an issue. This frees the player to concentrate on adding to the story rather than saving his character's butt. I often tell players up front that HEX is not a tactical game, and that becomes obvious soon after the adventure starts.<br/><br/>Unknown Armies is different. It's a gritty horror system. Even though it's not tactical, in the sense that the direction in which your character is facing is unimportant, it's still a horror game. My definition of the horror genre is that characters are engaged in a struggle just to keep what they have -- trying to come out ahead isn't even an option. UA reinforces this mood, and if I undermine that, I compromise the system's ability to tell the kind of story I want to tell. So in UA, players have no choice but to spend much of their time fending for their characters as best they can.<br/><br/>I mentioned at the top of this list (post #2) that I can only constrain the PCs in a UA game if I win the players' trust. Even then, the constraints that I can impose are limited, or I'll come across as a bully or a cheater.<br/><br/>But in a game system where character survival is less of an issue, the answer to your question is a resounding "yes, that's all there is to it."<br/><br/>- Todd                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_GM_for_Food" title="Will_GM_for_Food"><img alt="Will_GM_for_Food" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_GM_for_Food">Will_GM_for_Food</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345234/#Comment_345234" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-07T14:05:38+00:00" title="October  7, 2011  2:05PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I forgot to comment on this:\n<blockquote><cite>All citations from David Berg</cite>I played a cinematic action game a while back (hack of d20 BESM) where we got points for gratuitously stylish action. "Why turn around and shoot someone when you can do a flip and shoot them in midair instead?"</blockquote>\nExactly. The game system is designed to reinforce the telling of a particular kind of story. As Jared Sorensen likes to say, "This is what your game is <i>about</i>."\n<blockquote>In this game, the award criteria were so clear, and the point values so simple (1 point per narration), that anyone could have given out the points. I think handing the awarding to the players would have been a pure plus: our GM would have had more brain space for other things, and we players would have been more vocal in recognizing each other's cool play.</blockquote>\nI understand your reasoning, but I'd probably still shy away from letting one player reward another. It's too easy get "drift" if the players aren't disciplined or don't see eye-to-eye on the goal. Start off by rewarding witty one-liners, and some players will soon start quoting entire scenes from movies or TV shows, and getting points from other players for it.\n<blockquote>Then there was a Pitfighter game I ran in college where I used XP awards mainly to enforce my vision of the tenor of play. Bonuses for jokes at good moments, penalties for jokes that broke a serious vibe or threatened plausibility. There was no possible way for the players to know what was going to earn them what (at least not until they got to know my GM style<i>really</i>well), so I<i>had</i>to do the awarding.</blockquote>\nMy experience has been that even if the players could read your mind, the problem with using XP awards is the lack of immediacy. In most games that I know, experience points don't help you until you level up. They're just not perceived to be as valuable as points that can be spent in the next round or the next scene, so they have less of a reinforcing effect.<br/><br/>- Todd                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_345267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345267/#Comment_345267" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-07T23:35:13+00:00" title="October  7, 2011 11:35PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 7, 2011 11:35PM by David_Berg.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Todd,<br/><br/>Yeah, your point about fighting the system is a big part of the hurdles I'm seeing.  I think it extends all the way into the realm of expected possible outcomes, whether those are clear from the system or not.  Like, what do I expect to happen to my character if the GM mind-controls them?  There's a lot that factors into that!  Mechanical quantities, the described nature of the NPC doing the mind-controlling, any important decisions on the horizon that I'll miss out on if I have no agency, etc.  Constructing a safe space for this sort of thing seems to require at least three different elements in harmony -- system, meta-level communication, and the state of the fiction.  All 3 need to give us the thumbs-up before we can enjoy how mind-control makes for a good movie.<br/><br/>I think part of what makes this stressful and error-prone for a lot of GMs is working backward from the plan without first nailing down the process.  Because you, Todd, <i>already</i> know that "take control of your character and give you style points" is a thing you might do, you can set the players' expectations on this correctly, and scan your ruleset for compatibility with that.  Whereas a GM who ad-libs that same solution (grab control of character, give style points) in a moment of "this would make a good movie!" inspiration is more likely to run into unanticipated hurdles.<br/><br/>As a wannabe game-designer, I think there's a lot of value in nailing down such processes for GMs in actionable form.  The techniques for (e.g.) making a good movie, the steps to set group agreement on how the techniques will be used, and the mechanics to support those techniques in play.<br/><br/>So, to that end:<br/>Your point about XP's non-immediacy is well-taken.  Have you observed that a Style Point reward works differently?  What's a typical player response when you say "okay, now I'm finished mind controlling you, and you have more Style Points to spend; what do you do?"?  Or at least one example that comes to mind?

(Sorry if I already asked this in another thread.)</blockquote>\nI believe you did ask something like this previously, but I forgot to answer. Sorry.<br/><br/>The original request was for me to give examples of <i>how</i> I mind-control someone or have them trigger a trap in such a way that's palatable to a player. OK, maybe that's a different question entirely, but it feeds into the one above.<br/><br/>Example of mind control: This year's HEX adventure features a Big Bad who's very skilled in sorcery. I decided that his brand of sorcery also includes mind control, even though there's no canonical support for that conclusion.<br/><br/>This Big Bad is present in only two scenes: a car chase early in the adventure, and the climactic scene at the end. The PCs will definitely meet the Big Bad at the end. In contrast, there's no requirement for them to meet him -- or even discover he's present -- in the car chase. However, if a PC takes an action that will have him encounter the Big Bad in the car chase (for example, jumping onto the truck that's being chased and climbing inside, which is were the Big Bad is located), then by GM fiat, he'll meet the Big Bad and the Big Bad will mind-control him.<br/><br/>The mind control is hinted at, but not explicit. I describe the Big Bad's piercing stare and the fact that his eyes are entirely black. I toss the PC's player a Style Point and say, "You can't bring yourself to look away from those eyes. The audience sees a close-up of your face. As they watch, your eyes also turn entirely black." Then I cut back to the other PCs to build suspense. When I come back to the mind-controlled PC, he isn't forced to do anything. He just stands there. He can use an action every round to regain his will, and if he succeeds, he can do anything he wants. (Without exception, a player who breaks free always concludes on his own that the best course of action is to get out of the truck, which suits my purposes perfectly.) Or other PCs can use their actions to try to rescue this PC from the truck. Either way, the mind control is broken as soon as the Big Bad is off camera.<br/><br/>Or so it seems.<br/><br/>In the climactic scene at the end of the adventure, I toss that same player another Style Point. (I use poker chips for Style Points, which is why I'm saying I "toss" them.) Even though that PC may be nowhere near the Big Bad, the PC's eyes again turn all black and he starts to attack his comrades. Again, the PC can roll every round to break the control. The mind control typically lasts for no more than two rounds, which is enough for my purposes. It's more for drama than anything else. This time, when the control is broken, the break is permanent -- that character will not be targeted for mind control again.<br/><br/>The astute reader will notice that I apply constraints to my control. The character can't stop the control from starting, but always an opportunity to end it. There are multiple ways that other PCs can help end the control, such as by temporarily incapacitating the mind-controlled PC or by targeting the Big Bad. The control lasts only long enough to serve the story. It always happens early enough in the climactic scene that the mind-controlled character, once free, can still contribute meaningfully to the story. Almost invariably, the meaningful contribution is some sort of payback on the Big Bad for having mind-controlled the character in the first place. Which is both dramatically appropriate and supported by ample literary precedent.<br/><br/>I follow the same considerations when I use GM fiat to have a PC spring a trap, get captured by bad guys, or suffer any number of other dramatic-sounding inconveniences.<br/><br/>Let me know if this account hasn't answered your question I cited at the top of this post.<br/><br/>- Todd                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_345285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_GM_for_Food" title="Will_GM_for_Food"><img alt="Will_GM_for_Food" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_GM_for_Food">Will_GM_for_Food</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345285/#Comment_345285" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-08T07:17:26+00:00" title="October  8, 2011  7:17AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Quick comment on this observation:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>I think part of what makes [a GM taking away a player's options] stressful and error-prone for a lot of GMs is working backward from the plan without first nailing down the process.

That way, the PC she's attacking might conclude he can use a strategy that might have little chance of working against a fully conscious PC. For example, perhaps he can lure the mind-controlled PC into a rather obvious, but nonlethal, trap. <br/><br/>If I give control of the mind-controlled PC to the PC's player, the player might not think to leave those options available.<br/><br/>I should probably point out that all of my games are written to be accessible to someone who's never played the game system before. By extension, such a person has also never played with me before. So I can't presume that any of my players has experience with the kind of authorship power that I give them. I therefore maintain control over any situation that could go badly if the control were turned over to a novice player with no experience (or discipline) in these techniques.<br/><br/>Plus I'm a control freak. I may have mentioned that somewhere.\n<blockquote>I'm sure that, at the table, you can see quite easily what the player's response to the whole series of events is: are they excited and nervous, because it reinforces their feeling of how this kind of "movie" should go?

I couldn't comprehend that as the basis of a criticism, because all of my adventures play out pretty consistently. Players have free will, so no two runs of a game are identical. But the overall story is largely the same. Each session almost plays out as a remake of the same original movie. (Think the new Dawn of the Dead compared to the original Dawn of the Dead.)<br/><br/>Much of the reason for that is that I have a very firm concept of the structure of the movie -- a Plan, as David has been calling it. TomasHVM has told us in various threads that the way he runs games is very similar to my way, and he also gets pretty consistent results.<br/><br/>I'm not drawing any conclusions from this.

It worked, we really believed it was okay to give full rights to story events over to a player or a GM at times, because we all expected that person was doing so to please everyone.  To me, if someone has total control of the game, for a moment or even a campaign, if they're doing it to make the others happy it's going to work.<br/><br/>I've heard it said that "It's only Railroading if you don't like it."  What that means to me is that all these examples of 'having the players cooperate' in the railroad is really just putting down the attitude of "you can't tell me what to do!" and the fear of having a GM 'control' your character, and deciding instead to collaborate.  It's strange to me that the new wave of game design seems to insist that the only way for a group to collaborate is to design games where the GM can't pre-determine anything.  To me, pre-determined stuff isn't the problem, it's the approach of the gamers (pcs and gm).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/graypawn" title="graypawn"><img alt="graypawn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3334/3586780205_8c6584252f_o.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/graypawn">graypawn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345305/#Comment_345305" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-08T13:18:08+00:00" title="October  8, 2011  1:18PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Like, i wanted to say what this is to me:<br/><br/>Theory I'm seeing here:<br/>1) showing up with a goal to make a good fiction ("adventure movie", etc.)<br/>2) announcing that they will inflict unavoidable fates on your character toward that goal<br/>3) proving early on that they are in fact good at making the good fiction<br/>4) and then saying "trust me" and<br/>5) delivering what they've promised.

Just really, really, really mull it over.<br/>4) Tell them what things i would and would not do, COMMUNICATE AS CLEARLY AS POSSIBLE ("Guys, don't worry, i'm going to not pull my punches, but i won't kill your characters."  "Friends, i'd like an ongoing theme in this game be that you're always broke, so let's work together to constantly keep you all on the bottom, okay?")<br/>5) When someone doesn't like what you're doing with whatever control you have over the story, say so.  COMMUNICATE CLEARLY.  ("Dude, you're a Neutral Good, you're going to stab that old guy with the hot poker?"  "Hey, can we please move away from this town?  I'm kinda tired of being here.")<br/>6)  *Assume your friends are working with you* - When someone says "trust me" do it.  If it fails you, explain why, and work through it.  Never hold dissapointment over someone, and help anyone that feels they're 'not delivering' have agency and place amongst the others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_345306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345306/#Comment_345306" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-08T13:24:19+00:00" title="October  8, 2011  1:24PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Could you name the rule and the game where the GM can't pre-determine anything?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_GM_for_Food" title="Will_GM_for_Food"><img alt="Will_GM_for_Food" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_GM_for_Food">Will_GM_for_Food</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345307/#Comment_345307" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-08T14:26:39+00:00" title="October  8, 2011  2:26PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graypawn:<br/><br/>Your analysis of the theory is correct.<br/><br/>The method you described under "What I used to play like" is very difficult for me to pull off. I only run games at conventions, there are strict time limits for convention events, and I'm a very slow thinker when it comes to formulating a story. As a consequence, my scenarios have a long prep time and are tightly structured.<br/><br/>But if I were faster on my feet, I'd possibly consider using such an approach. I've seen other GMs use it to great effect.<br/><br/>Judd:<br/><br/>I can't cite a rule or a game system that backs me up, since I don't know the indie RPGs well, but I have the same perception as Graypawn regarding the indie-RPG community's disdain for pre-determined events. <br/><br/>Several years ago I saw an actual-play post on another forum where a player recounted a very cool plot twist he threw into an indie RPG adventure. (In a nutshell, he produced an item from another PC's past that had great value to the other PC and used it as a bargaining chip.) Everyone agreed the twist made for a great story.<br/><br/>The OP then apologized for "surprising" the other players. My impression was that he wasn't apologizing to players of that game for having violated a rule of the game. Rather, he was apologizing to all members of the forum, whether they played the game system or not, for violating a cultural norm.<br/><br/>Some of the people who replied to the post explicitly forgave the OP for his transgression because it worked in that case. But my inference was that the community frowned upon any plot twist that was not formulated collectively by all the players.<br/><br/>I've seen hints of deep-seated reservations against pre-determination in other locations, including on this forum. I'm not criticizing those posters. Quite the contrary, everyone's willingness to enter into open discussions on the topic has been laudable, and I think we're all benefiting from the talks. But those reservations support the perception I share with Graypawn.<br/><br/>- Todd                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_345309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345309/#Comment_345309" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-08T15:22:38+00:00" title="October  8, 2011  3:22PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dogs in the Vineyard, Apocalypse World, Burning Wheel, Burning Empires, and Sorcerer are a few of the games I can think of that have GM preparation that goes on before the game and/or in between games.<br/><br/>To my mind, there is a general indie RPGer (very general) dislike of not so much preparing but for pre-determining, causing players' choices to be null and void at the table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345312">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345312/#Comment_345312" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-08T16:47:12+00:00" title="October  8, 2011  4:47PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>Could you give an in-game example of how you penalized a player for a joke at the wrong moment?</blockquote>It's embarrassing.

There definitely IS a strong sense "here" (the Story-Games/indie game community) that pre-determined game content (particularly content which devalues player choice) is Not a Good Thing.<br/><br/>Many of the games that are popular in these circles are all about unplanned outcomes, surprising outcomes, and 100% free player choice. The little anecdote you cited is a perfect example.<br/><br/>If that wasn't the case, we wouldn't even be having this discussion right now.<br/><br/>Part of that may have to do with the historical basis for this community: in many ways it grew out of people trying to design games along the lines of "Narrativist play/Story Now", as defined by Ron Edwards et al. And for that style of play, at least in the forms which we usually see, the GM forcing certain outcomes on the players is absolutely contrary to the whole point of those games. <br/><br/>In fact, I remember my own introduction to these ideas:<br/><br/>I asked a friend of mine: "Is it possible to design an RPG where the GM cannot railroad the players?" He thought about and said, "Absolutely not."<br/><br/>So I thought about some, too. I'd been reading (and playing, a little) the Pool. And I realized that, yeah, in that game, a GM cannot railroad the players. (At least not consistently.) A player can always roll all his/her dice (and probably succeed), and then guarantee the conflict resolves in their favour via the Monologue of Victory. That realization was an eye-opening moment for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_345323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345323/#Comment_345323" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-08T19:43:55+00:00" title="October  8, 2011  7:43PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems to me that that there are some near-universal agreements about GM pre-planned outcomes, and then also some completely divergent responses.<br/><br/>I suspect we all (indie, trad, OSR, whatever) agree that handing a player a choice, letting them choose, and then saying, "The choice you made doesn't matter!" sucks.

[...]</blockquote>\nUnderstood, David, but are you always responding as your character, or are you responding as the author of a good story in which your character is one of the dramatis personae? I always encourage players to do the latter. I had a player who overrode the results of a favorable die roll specifically for the purpose of <i>losing</i> the love of his life. That was an extreme example of a player's deliberately acting against his character's best interest, but I've got plenty of less-extreme examples.<br/><br/>That's the mindset I try to cultivate among my players. Their job is not to take all measures necessary to ensure the well-being of their character. Their job is to help me make the <i>movie audience</i> worry about the well-being of their character. If they can internalize that philosophy, it's not a big deal to them when I impose constraints or take control, because we're all on the same page.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>Whether it's the hard-to-kill-PCs mechanics or the heroes-don't-die-early movie idiom, I'd be surprised to see the "well, logically..." response<i>completely</i>overridden.

Or do you get your players into a mindset where they don't approach their decisions via in-fiction logic?</blockquote>\nSince Hollow Earth Expedition is a pulp game, cold logic is not a prevalent motivator of the NPCs' actions. Dreams of turning a PC against another PC are the kinds of things that make an Eeeville Villain cackle in his sleep.<br/><br/>But even outside of pulp, suboptimal tactics aren't hard to justify in a story. Few realistic characters are entirely unbiased and are operating on perfect information. It's not hard to come up with a reason why an NPC would think a PC shouldn't be immediately dispatched. I would design that reason into the adventure.<br/><br/>It's also worth noting that there are times when I have something in mind and I can't figure out how to make it happen. When that occurs, I've been known to solicit the players' input as screenwriters. Specific examples elude me, but they're along the lines of my saying, "I want to have the next scene in the laundromat. Can anybody come up with a reason why your character would go there right now?" In those cases, I've never had a player refuse to cooperate. Most will bend over backwards to help me out. If I happen to explain why they need to go to the laundromat, players have occasionally offered viable alternatives to the laundromat that feel more plausible to them and would achieve the same effect. In those cases, I've been happy to go with their suggestions.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>I suspect we all (indie, trad, OSR, whatever) agree that handing a player a choice, letting them choose, and then saying, "The choice you made doesn't matter!" sucks.  We call that a violation.</blockquote>\nWe certainly do agree. Back in the 90s, I once screwed this up so badly in a game I was co-GMing that I had to call an unscheduled 10-minute break, just so I could figure out how to fix what I had broken with a clumsy GM fiat. In 19 years of running convention games, that was my absolute worst experience as a GM. I was sweating bullets before I came up with a solution. That event led directly to the way I do things now.<br/><br/>I am aware that GM fiat (or pre-determined events, whatever you want to call it) can be badly botched. I know that's why many people are reluctant to recommend or employ the technique. I sympathize with that reluctance. But an outright ban strikes me as an overreaction. That's the case I'm trying to make with this discussion. And the folks here have been very receptive to the discussion, for which I'm truly grateful.<br/><br/>- Todd                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_345329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345329/#Comment_345329" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-08T22:29:46+00:00" title="October  8, 2011 10:29PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I play an incredible number games with an even more incredible number of people (because I organize gaming events and communities, I just gamed with 18 different people today).<br/><br/>I also have had a lot of terrible gaming experience (ultimately a small fraction compared to my amazing experiences).

He does the most amazing job I have ever seen setting the expectations of the game before play starts. He is upfront about what he wants and why. If he is going to take control of your character, he will define the limits of when and how that will happen. No one is lied to. No one is blindsided. You willingly give Todd control of your character under specific guidelines and it works out great. <br/><br/>How do you keep players from getting annoyed for taking control of your character?

As long as the predetermination still allows ample opportunity for a player to contribute to the story, and the players have been told to expect such a thing, and the players trust the GM, I find it to be a viable storytelling technique.<br/><br/>- Todd                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_345333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345333/#Comment_345333" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-08T22:50:19+00:00" title="October  8, 2011 10:50PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Will GM for Food</cite>I couldn't comprehend that as the basis of a criticism, because all of my adventures play out pretty consistently.

In a convention game with a single GM, where I have only a single protagonist to control instead of the extensive movie-making powers I get when GMing or co-GMing, I'm probably going to be primed to be responding and striving in-character quite a bit.<br/><br/>I also figure that striving in-character isn't a problem in your games <i>most</i> of the time, so you probably have better things to do at the table than say, "Whoa Dave, looks like you're really getting into avoiding the death ray.

I'm really enjoying this discussion.<br/><br/>My experience has been the same as Matt's, and I suspect it's quite common in "these circles":<br/><br/>It's not so much driven by players who are sick of being railroaded. I think it's been driven by <i>GMs</i> who are tired of railroading. <br/><br/>I remember being a pretty heavy "control freak" GM, coming up with storylines, arranging circumstances and expectations so that the players didn't have any room for objections. (Often, with proper scenario design and character design, you can create situations where a certain outcome or a certain character decision is the only logical thing to do. If you do it well, no one feels railroaded.)<br/><br/>From what I remember, except for one game that comes to mind, the players felt like they had a ton of freedom, never felt railroaded, and enjoyed themselves a whole lot.<br/><br/>Sometimes it wasn't even a case of manipulation in any sense: sometimes I'd know one of my players well enough to know what they would choose to do ahead of time, and I could plan around that.<br/><br/>But I got really tired of running games that way:<br/><br/>* First, it was a LOT of work. And the work didn't always pay off, because the thing I thought was cool and spent all that effort setting up... the players might not really dig it all that much.<br/>* Second, it was unrewarding in the long run: all my games turned out the same way. The way I'd planned for them to turn out. (Even in "sandbox" play: the amount of power I had over the game as a GM using "Rule Zero" meant that inadvertently over time, my creative vision would predominate.)<br/><br/>When I discovered games that allowed me to set things but not plan, so that I could be surprised by the way the story turned out. I could play (as GM), and experience that same joy of "turning the page" to find out what happens next. Just like reading a good book (or whatever). Not planning ahead allowed me to free up that side of my brain and enjoy the story and its surprises.<br/><br/>I don't think my experience is uncommon in the "indie/story game" circuit. It's not so much the vision of a disgruntled player, but the vision of a GM who's looking for a different experience and more surprises at the table. But that's just a guess/observation on my part! I don't really know if it's as common as I think (although I've heard many of the "big-name" designers around here voice this kind of opinion in the past).<br/><br/>Anyway, just a data point. I'm listening and looking forward to hearing more about all this stuff!

I do that. I write two scenarios for each calendar year. At every convention I go to that year (four or five), I run those scenarios. At the end of the year, I permanently retire those scenarios. Lather, rinse, repeat.<br/><br/>That's a frequent enough rotation for me.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite>It just seems like you're doing so much unnecessary *work*, Todd.  Why not just let the game hand you the movie structure you want?</blockquote>\nThis feels like a trick question. If I'm understanding this question correctly, there are two answers. The first answer has <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=14899&amp;page=1#Item_0" rel="nofollow">already been provided</a>, at great length.<br/><br/>The second answer is, that's what hobbyists do. Your aunt knits when she can just as easily buy clothes off the rack. Why go to that effort? Your cousin makes beautiful furniture in his spare time. Why not just slap a few two-by-fours together and be done with it? They'll hold up a lamp just fine. To those of us who do what we do, the effort is part of the fun.<br/><br/>There is absolutely no question that my approach is a lot of work. I've had many players tell me it's something about my games that they appreciate. It's also something that I enjoy.<br/><br/>Slight change of topic here. I've mentioned before that I GM traditional games -- with some nontraditional twists, but they're still traditional games. I haven't been won over by what I'll call the indie RPG movement, for reasons that I might go into some day. But there are things that I readily credit the indie RPG movement for. One of those things is a variety of game frameworks that will allow participants to play an RPG with little initial outlay of time or effort. I think that's a great thing.<br/><br/>But there's no such thing as a free lunch. I firmly believe that the session that comes from little effort will always suffer somehow, most often in the coherence of the fiction or the sense of immersion in the game. Most people probably feel that the loss of coherent plotline or immersion is very small, and that this miniscule loss is a fair sacrifice for being able to play quickly. I support that perspective. <br/><br/>But I don't share it. <br/><br/>Coherent storyline and immersive experience are hugely important to me. My experience has been that they can only be achieved by having a single hand at the helm. And that hand is always busy making small course corrections.<br/><br/>Regardless of whether my beliefs are correct, the rewards I've gotten from my approach, in terms of emotional reactions and feedback from my players and in terms of my own enjoyment, have been immense beyond description. So I'm not giving it up anytime soon.  :-)<br/><br/>- Todd                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_345378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_GM_for_Food" title="Will_GM_for_Food"><img alt="Will_GM_for_Food" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_GM_for_Food">Will_GM_for_Food</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345378/#Comment_345378" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-09T20:06:37+00:00" title="October  9, 2011  8:06PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>All citations from David Berg</cite>I also figure that striving in-character isn't a problem in your games <i>most</i> of the time, so you probably have better things to do at the table than say, "Whoa Dave, looks like you're really getting into avoiding the death ray.

First off, I can't imagine I'd use GM fiat to have a character hit by a death ray, unless for some reason I had scripted that the death ray wasn't going to work as designed. But let's just run with this example for a moment.<br/><br/>If you've invested caring about avoiding the death ray, then I've already failed. Remember, if the GM tells you something will happen beforehand, it's a constraint. If he tells you afterward, it's cheating. That's how players perceive these things. So if you've already put energy of any kind into caring about avoiding the death ray, either I sprung the circumstance on you too late (my bad), or I've already told you you can't avoid it and you ignored me (your bad). \n<blockquote>So I'm wondering if "make a movie" really does cover that, or whether you employ other, more specific techniques to avoid that situation.</blockquote>\nNo, it really is the "make a movie" analogy that I invoke during these times. If the predetermined event wouldn't make a better movie, I won't do it. If my proposed event is going to piss off a player, then that event is almost certainly ill-advised because it would probably make a worse movie.<br/><br/>Let me give an example of a slightly different thing that happened the last time I ran my Hollow Earth Expedition adventure. It may be somewhat enlightening.<br/><br/>It's the start of the a round of the final climactic scene. All the PCs are engaged in a huge fight with the Big Bad and his minions. The Big Bad won't be standing for much longer. We roll for initiative. A player whom I'll call "Ted" wins. Ted's running the only PC who's a sorcerer. The Big Bad is also a sorcerer.<br/><br/>So I turn to Ted first and ask him what his character does. I forget the details of Ted's answer, but he described a course of action that, if successful, would immediately and permanently destroy all of the opponents and end the conflict. Normally when this happens, I tell the player, "OK, then for dramatic reasons, you'll go last this round. I'll come back to you at the end." I'm not penalizing the player when I do this. I want to make sure that every player gets an action in the final round, and Ted's success would make that impossible.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I couldn't guess what the other five players had planned. My fear was that by the time we'd come back to Ted, the other players might have taken out the Big Bad and won the day. Then that deprives Ted of his chance to shine. So I rejected the option of the "dramatic delay." Instead, I decided to turn this into a teaching moment.<br/><br/>I said to Ted, "Ted, do you realize that if your plan works as you described, none of the other players will have anything to do for the rest of the round?" Ted looked around the table as if he were seeing the other players for the first time. When he said, "Oh!" I knew the light had gone on.<br/><br/>I asked Ted, "Can you think of something you can do now that would be just as cool as your original idea, but still leave something for the other players to do?" Ted thought for a moment and came up with an alternate plan that worked rather well and still left bad guys standing. It turned out to be the final round of the combat, and all of the PCs got an action. <br/><br/>After the game, Ted came up to me and said of that last round, "You were right. I didn't think about the effects of my action on the other players."<br/><br/>So what was my point? Oh, yes: I pulled Ted out of character and asked to share some of the burden of the director with him. He accepted the responsibility for rewriting that scene, for the sole reason that he and I wanted to make sure his character was <i>less</i> effective than originally proposed and that the other players had a hand in the victory as well. And it really did make a better movie. <br/><br/>Oh, in relation to an earlier post: I'm aware that in pulling Ted out of character, I also sacrificed immersion. I can deal with that now and again, as long as it doesn't happen often. And here, it was worth the price.<br/><br/>- Todd                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_GM_for_Food" title="Will_GM_for_Food"><img alt="Will_GM_for_Food" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_GM_for_Food">Will_GM_for_Food</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345381/#Comment_345381" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-09T20:27:35+00:00" title="October  9, 2011  8:27PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>All by Paul T.</cite>When I discovered games that allowed me to set things but not plan, so that I could be surprised by the way the story turned out.

To me, they don't seem like obvious extensions of "make a good movie".  I think I can do <i>some</i> things to help a group make a good movie, but I doubt I'd have come up with that response to Ted.  I might have come up with it afterward!  But in the heat of the moment, probably not.<br/><br/>So, in my eyes, that's a specific technique, just like whatever you'd do with the death ray.  They fall under the umbrella of "make a good movie", but they're not easily or obviously reducible to that (at least, not to me).  If I was reading a "Todd's GMing" manual, I'd want those specifics to be in there!<br/><br/>I think we're on the same page here, but let me check.  When you say this:\n<blockquote>If you've invested caring about avoiding the death ray, then I've already failed. Remember, if the GM tells you something will happen beforehand, it's a constraint. If he tells you afterward, it's cheating.</blockquote>My understanding is that, in your games, it is <i>generally</i> okay for players to invest in character goals and efforts, maybe falling more into living a movie than making one for a bit.  The time when this is <i>not</i> okay is specifically when <i>you</i> need to do something with or to their character for the good of the movie.  During those times, you have to get there first.  You <i>must</i> announce what's unavoidably coming <i>before</i> the player might start trying to avoid it.<br/><br/>Am I correct on all of those points?<br/><br/>Always getting there first sounds hard to me.  But that's probably because I ad-lib a lot when I GM.  When you GM, do you have something written down that says, "Scene 9: Make sure Brad's character falls into a hole," so then you can give Brad fair warning (e.g., as you describe the scene and let everyone know that the hole exists)?<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>-Dave                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_345398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345398/#Comment_345398" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-10T01:17:11+00:00" title="October 10, 2011  1:17AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 10, 2011 1:26AM by TomasHVM.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been part of this forum for some years now, and keep coming back. The reason is, of course, that it actually makes a difference what you say here. People ask questions, even when faced with challenges to their own prejudice/positions, like you do in this thread, and that is a good way to move forward. So please read what follows in that light.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>There definitely IS a strong sense "here" (the Story-Games/indie game community) that pre-determined game content (particularly content which devalues player choice) is Not a Good Thing.</blockquote>This sounds very strange to me. Not having pre-determined game content is like not having flavor to your a game at all. Why strive for that?<br/><br/>Setting up scenarios with certain aspects pre-determined is something most of us do all the time. What you are reacting to is how Todd is doing it different. It triggers your <i>this-is-railroading</i> reflex. It's not railroading, in the meaning "bad for the players", it's leading the game in ways that ensures a sharp theme-management and maximum enjoyment for all. There are lots of way of doing this, and this is one hell of an effective way of doing it.<br/><br/>I've proposed before, for people here and elsewhere, to investigate their own ideas of <i>railroading</i> with more thoroughness. If you say "railroading" and put all things reminding you of it in a big, dark sack, you end up knowing nothing of what's in that sack. A big black sack like that rapidly becomes a drag to your understanding of role-playing games; a sack of prejudice.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Will GM for Food</cite>Regardless of whether my beliefs are correct, the rewards I've gotten from my approach, in terms of emotional reactions and feedback from my players and in terms of my own enjoyment, have been immense beyond description.</blockquote>I've done this too, and had the same experiences. There no coincidence players and GMs came back to the game-convention <i>Arcon</i> in Oslo year after year, to play Fabula in my tournaments; We succeeded year and again with what Todd is describing here. The players came to expect on the edge role-playing, with new takes on how to do social interaction, combat, artistry, magic, etc-etc. We built our scenarios with no prejudice; always choosing the tools we needed to make the best of the theme chosen, and running them with higher goals for the interaction. Some scenarios ran with almost no pre-determined elements, some ran with "normal" interaction, and some ran beautifully with really strong railroading. <br/><br/>The point is that all these scenarios worked, and the players came back for more. The payback for both them, the GMs and myself, was great!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite>To be honest, this specific thing completely fills me with horror--oddly, moreso than any of the GM Fiat stuff, but they're obviously related.  It just sounds insanely boring to run.</blockquote>You know not of what you speak. Running a game that makes players burst out in tears, in character, and then having them play on with even more acuity, is as far from boring you could ever come. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite>It just seems like you're doing so much unnecessary *work*, Todd.  Why not just let the game hand you the movie structure you want?</blockquote>How can you say that Todd does a lot of "unnecessary work", when what he does brings him so far in capturing and awakening the players imagination? I consider Todd's work, as presented in several threads here the last month, an example of really great GM-craft in classical role-playing games. It's necessary for role-playing games in general that the qualities of such work is acknowledged.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345425">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345425/#Comment_345425" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-10T11:07:15+00:00" title="October 10, 2011 11:07AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dear Tomas,<br/><br/>Please get Fabula translated into English!<br/><br/>I am really, really interested in (a) how much of what you do can actually be conveyed through writing, and (b) whether you've yet maximized that.<br/><br/>Actually, screw writing, how about communication of <i>any</i> sort?

There has been a trend in "modern game design", and on this forum, to investigate games that have little-or-none of pre-planned events that must come to pass, predictable endings, and all forms of railroading. Particularly in "Narrativist" design, as described by the folks at the Forge, railroading and similar techniques are not a good fit: many of the games that came out of that culture were focused on finding solutions to gameplay <i>without</i> a strong plot/railroad provided by the GM (or the players, in the case of modern/GMless games). I'd say finding solutions to what at the Forge was called The Impossible Thing Before Breakfast* dominated the design discussion for much of the last decade.<br/><br/>*: an <a href="http://ptgptb.org/0027/theory101-02.html" rel="nofollow">example</a> of early discussion on this topic.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>I've proposed before, for people here and elsewhere, to investigate their own ideas of<i>railroading</i>with more thoroughness.

I'm currently writing the new edition, which is supposed to encompass all experiences I've had, and developments I've done, with this game for the last 12 years, while playing it both professionally, for free at conventions, and with friends. That's approximately 2000 game-sessions for me alone. <br/><br/>But I don't even know how it will be published! I'll worry about that when the books are written (3 of them).<br/><br/>I doubt that it will be translated.

Sorry!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>I am really, really interested in (a) how much of what you do can actually be conveyed through writing, and (b) whether you've yet maximized that.</blockquote>I've not maximized it, no. Far from it!<br/><br/>But a lot of what I've done with Fabula, at least at conventions, is done in tournaments with a group of GMs. I always try to give them written material before the convention, with all they need at hand to lead the scenario. A very important part of this material has been instructions in particular methodical tools to support the chosen scenario.<br/><br/>And I've usually managed to hold a gathering or two with the GMs beforehand, trying out the scenario, and discussing it, so they are able to lead the groups we get into the sort of game-play that will best support the chosen scenario. We've tried things out, discussed it and learned from it while making it work. <br/><br/>In the end I have always been very specific about what I expect my GMs to do, down to details like how you greet the players, how you have them seated, tidying the table before play, working with tempo, cutting scenes before the climax, touching players, provoking emotional responses to mirror the characters, use of dice (or not), and so forth ...<br/><br/>For me the conventions has worked as intense workshops for further developments of the game. And my GMs have been great partners in practical game-design. In this I have been very diligent, communicative, and successful. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>It's fun to explore the "other path", as in most things in life.</blockquote>An excellent position!

The finale of that one was magnificent, and so way out there that I had to redo the whole method to make it work.</span> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_345487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345487/#Comment_345487" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-10T18:32:00+00:00" title="October 10, 2011  6:32PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tomas!<br/><br/>My hat's off to you, sir.

To me, they don't seem like obvious extensions of "make a good movie".  I think I can do<i>some</i>things to help a group make a good movie, but I doubt I'd have come up with that response to Ted.  I might have come up with it afterward!  But in the heat of the moment, probably not.<br/></blockquote>\nI'm probably stretching the analogy of "making a movie" too far. In retrospect, I think you're right, David: My example with Ted had nothing to do with making a good movie.<br/><br/>But I will argue that I try to do what's best for the audience. Usually by "audience" I mean those imaginary people in the theater who are watching our production. But sometimes the audience I'm referring to the players themselves, as was the case with Ted.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>My understanding is that, in your games, it is<i>generally</i>okay for players to invest in character goals and efforts, maybe falling more into living a movie than making one for a bit.  The time when this is<i>not</i>okay is specifically when<i>you</i>need to do something with or to their character for the good of the movie.  During those times, you have to get there first.  You<i>must</i>announce what's unavoidably coming<i>before</i>the player might start trying to avoid it.<br/><br/>Am I correct on all of those points?</blockquote>\nI don't think I'd ever consider it <i>wrong</i> for a player to invest in character goals. I just reserve the right to lengthen the path that it takes to get to them. Remember, even in the example of the car chase, the characters do ultimately get the chance to recover the crate. Collectively, the players have succeeded at that task in every session I've run.<br/><br/>That's why examples like "I declare that your character must get hit by the death ray" aren't good examples of what I do. There's no recovery from that. The goal isn't made more distant; it's annihilated entirely.<br/><br/>In all other respects, what you've said is correct, David.<br/><br/>I'd also like to reinforce here that if a player takes the initiative to lengthen his own path to arrive at his character's goals -- that is, he elects to visit some form of adversity upon his own character -- I'll immediately reward him in whatever way the game system allows. <br/><br/>I don't penalize players who don't inconvenience their characters. So I'm using a lot more carrot than stick.<br/><br/>[Ponders] Now that I think about it, David, I don't always constrain a player before he tries something. There's one case where I'll do it afterwards, but usually as a suggestion to the player, not as GM fiat. Here's an example.<br/><br/>In one of my recent sessions of the Hollow Earth Adventure with the car chase, one of the characters is a weird scientist who can invent or modify devices to do all sorts of pseudoscientific stuff. During the car chase in this particular session, the scientist's player had his character somehow modify the car that he was a passenger in and that was chasing the truck. (I say "somehow" because the movie audience didn't see the modification. The player declared that his character was under the dashboard and that only his lower extremities were visible. Consequently, neither the audience, nor the other players, nor I knew what modifications the character had made.) The player told me he'd tell me when the modification takes effect. I'm fine with that approach.<br/><br/>Later, another character announced that he was pushing in (activating) the cigarette lighter in the car. The pseudoscientist player jumped up at that point and said, "And the car accelerates like a rocket!" It was a cool dramatic effect.<br/><br/>Later in the scene, the player used the car's cigarette lighter for a second pseudoscientific purpose, I forget what. No problem there. But when he tried to use the lighter a third time in the same scene, I told him, "That'll be the third time the audience will see the lighter do something unexpected. My fear is they're starting to get bored of the lighter. Since your character can modify any device, instead of using the lighter to do what you wanted to do, can you use something else?" The player obliged.<br/><br/>Game mechanically, my request made absolutely no difference. The new device did exactly what he wanted the lighter to do. But the player understood why I was asking him to do what I did. <br/><br/>- Todd                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_345491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_GM_for_Food" title="Will_GM_for_Food"><img alt="Will_GM_for_Food" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_GM_for_Food">Will_GM_for_Food</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345491/#Comment_345491" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-10T18:41:25+00:00" title="October 10, 2011  6:41PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>I, for one, would love to hear more about this.

Todd,<br/><br/>Thanks for the explanations.  "Make your own life difficult" and "try that in a more entertaining way" are techniques I'm actually quite familiar with!  I see how they fit into your games, but I'm still not sure if I know your answer to the specific situation I'm worried about.<br/><br/>My example was bad; I didn't intend to imply that the death ray would actually kill the character.  (I must be too used to superhero fiction where a death ray never actually inflicts death.)  So let's call it a mind-control ray.<br/><br/>I get the sense that, yes, if you are going to unavoidably mind-control my character, you <i>must</i> tell me this <i>before</i> I say, "A mind-control ray!  My greatest fear!  I flee!" or something.  But I can react pretty fast!  You say, "As the villain lifts the gun, you see wires going from it into his glowing brain," and I'm ready to go!<br/><br/>So... <i>how</i> do you get there first?  Have you ever failed?  If so, what did you change so that you wouldn't fail the same way the next time?<br/><br/>Perhaps the reason it's taking us a while to connect on this is because the solution is obvious to you, and saying, "Sure," to my speculating covers it.  But it's not obvious to me!  <br/><br/>Do you ever ad-lib the Unavoidable?  \n<ul>\n<li>If so, how do you identify situations where you will or won't introduce the Unavoidable as those situations arise in play?</li>\n<li>If not, is there a particular time when you make sure to plan the Unavoidable?

Before you introduce a threat?<br/></li>\n</ul>\nThanks,<br/>-David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_345513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345513/#Comment_345513" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-10T23:16:55+00:00" title="October 10, 2011 11:16PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 11, 2011 1:17AM by TomasHVM.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have the feeling that a lot of modern games actually makes the players railroad themselves, and to great effect.

I feel I'm doing a terrible job of answering them, but no one's ever asked them before, so I really have to think about my answers. <br/><br/>There's a children's book where a worm asks a centipede how it walks with all those legs. The centipede tries to explain which legs it moves in which order, and promptly falls over. When it tries to <i>think</i> about it, it can't figure out how it walks. Then a bird flies over and it runs like heck. I feel like the centipede. And there's no bird in sight.<br/><br/>It may also help to know that I create all of the player characters in the game ahead of time, so I know what their backstories and motivations are.\n<blockquote><cite>All posted by David Berg</cite>Do you ever ad-lib the Unavoidable?</blockquote>\nYup. In one run of the HEX adventure, during the car chase through Manhattan, three characters in one car brought the car to a screeching halt, with the rear end of the car hanging over the edge of a huge hole in the street. (The bad guys had detonated dynamite to block their escape.) The driver of the car successfully made a roll to keep the car from falling into the hole. <br/><br/>Earlier in the car chase, another pursuing vehicle had ended up in the subway. (Remember, it's pulp. Stuff like that can happen.) Since I already knew I was going to have some of the action in the subway, I figured it might be entertaining to move all of the action to the subway. <br/><br/>So I tossed the driver a Style Point. I narrated that an empty barrel* rolled down the street and just barely tapped the car. But it was enough to make the car slowly slide backwards over the edge of the hole. The camera shows a close-up of the driver's face as the driver slides away from the camera in slow motion. Then we cut to the bottom of the hole (the subway, of course) as the car crashes down. It's pulp, so all damage to the car is cosmetic.<br/><br/>We spent a few rounds with the cars in the subway, trying to avoid subway trains, getting strange looks as they drive past platforms with waiting commuters, the whole nine yards. Much fun was had. And ultimately, of course, both cars drive up the stairs of a subway entrance, onto the street right behind the truck, and resume the chase.<br/><br/>Was the GM fiat well received? Yes. <br/><br/>How did I know it would be? Well, why wouldn't it be?\n<ul>\n<li>The driver had not spent any resources (Style Points) on her roll to keep the car on the street. If she had spent any, I'd have returned them to her immediately.<br/></li><li>The players had been informed up front that they weren't going to catch the bad guys, so the detour into the subway had no effect on their characters' success in their endeavor.<br/></li><li>The players had also been told up front to make the car chase as exciting as they could. The opportunity to deal with  subway trains was an entertaining diversion from the car chase and gave the players ample opportunities to be creative in new ways.<br/></li><li>Following ample pulp precedent, after the obstacle of the subway was dealt with, the players -- by their own design -- were in a position to resume the car chase at the same point as if they had never left it.<br/></li></ul>\nWhat's not to like about that situation? It didn't diminish any of the characters' resources or effectiveness, and it gave them a new way (venue) to fulfill the assignment.I gave them at the beginning of the scene.<br/><br/>* During the game, the thing that bumped into the car and tipped them over the edge wasn't a barrel. The stunt I used was a little clumsier. It was replaced with the barrel in postproduction.\n<blockquote>If so, how do you identify situations where you will or won't introduce the Unavoidable as those situations arise in play?</blockquote>\n<ul><li>The Unavoidable Thing has to be supported by the genre. The stunt I described above would be inappropriate in one of my Unknown Armies games.<br/></li><li>The stunt has to serve a purpose. In a light-hearted game, the purpose is usually that it's fun. In a serious game, the stunt serves to drive the story.<br/></li><li>The stunt can't compromise the integrity of the story. Stunts that require that characters behave out of character, that introduce plot holes, or that are irritatingly repetitive are no-nos. Genre can affect what constitutes a no-no.<br/></li><li>The stunt mustn't flat-out prevent a character from achieving a goal. Delaying the achievement is OK. Making it inaccessible for the remainder of the movie is not.<br/></li><li>Ideally, the stunt shouldn't diminish the character's resources. For example, damage to characters is temporary and damage to equipment is nothing more than "color text." If the stunt does diminish the character's resources, the character has to be compensated for that fact. In the scene after the car chase, everyone's car was again in new condition, for free. If the stunt puts a character in a position where she's practically forced to spend Style Points (for example, to let her roll for a skill she doesn't normally have, and she wouldn't have had to make those rolls had the stunt not been invoked), I have to give all those Style Points back later, probably with interest.<br/></li><li>There are probably other considerations that I'm missing.<br/></li></ul>\nIf all of the disqualifiers are absent from the situation, the stunt is usually worth doing. This is kind of like a physicist's explanation for why you can see through glass: "Because glass is missing all of the properties that make something opaque [for example, a free outer electron]. Glass is therefore transparent because there's no reason you can't see through it." Similarly, if there's nothing contraindicating the stunt, go with it.\n<blockquote>If not, is there a particular time when you make sure to plan the Unavoidable?  Before the session?  Before you conceive a threat?  Before you introduce a threat?</blockquote>\nSome Unavaoidables, as you call them, are scripted into the adventure. They serve almost like the planned encounters in D&amp;D.<br/><br/>I also try to brainstorm potential unscripted Unavoidables as I'm writing an adventure. Those are Unavoidables that I'll only use if certain precedents are fulfilled (Jack goes into the basement alone; a character drinks the potion within view of the natives; etc.) and if their use adds something significant to the story and if time permits.<br/><br/>That's all I can think up for now, David.<br/><br/>- Todd<br/><br/><i>Edit, 'cause it's late.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345622/#Comment_345622" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-11T21:19:35+00:00" title="October 11, 2011  9:19PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Todd,<br/><br/>Great point about not wasting resources or squashing effectiveness.  The car chase subway fall fits that bill because the players' proximity to their object of pursuit did not qualify as either a resource or effectiveness*.  That is, if you know you're not going to catch the car, then it doesn't matter how far you are above/below/behind it at any given moment.  And then you have a bundle of genre expectations to reinforce that.  I think that's an excellent example of the non-problematic case, and your analysis of it makes sense to me.<br/><br/>I'm still not sure about the problematic case.  Where a player might in fact win this encounter, and they think that dodging the mind control ray will help them win this encounter, but then you tell them they don't get to dodge the mind control ray.<br/><br/>Can I ask again if you've ever failed to "get there first" ("first" = before the player decided they cared about dodging the ray)?<br/><br/>It seems likely to me now that you restrict your ad-lib of Unavoidables to non-problematic situations.  So I guess I'm probably looking for an event that you had planned, but didn't tell the players about way in advance.  Probably in Unknown Armies, where the support of an "anything is reversible" genre isn't present.  I'm guessing that implied danger without explicitly established consequences is a good place to look.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>-David<br/><br/>*Dear Forge nerds: I'm actually talking about currency in total here, and in this case it's actually positioning.

The imaginary audience isn't going to judge you - it's less intense than trying to perform for your fellow players, even though that's the practical consequence.<br/><br/>The other thing that occurs to me is that having a fixed outcome relieves a very particular sort of pressure from the group.  In a 'no fixed outcome' game, we're all hoping to produce an outcome that's also a good starting point for what happens next, we just don't know what it is.  (Either that or a terminal outcome that is somehow satisfying.)  We hope it will emerge naturally.  But there are lots of ways for it not to happen - the group getting split up, inadvertently leeching the dramatic tension out of the scene, hitting an unsatisfying terminal outcome either mechanically (e.g. unexpected player death) or narratively (a character's driving motive is obviated, etc).<br/><br/>This makes me wonder about the 'world of constraints' and what they do to the game.  A GM could say, "You're not splitting up, ever.  I'm not going to split you up, and I need your help in coming up with reasons and excuses to stay together, whatever's happening."  The GM fudging the dice is a sort of invisible constraint, "I don't want you to die just yet, because that would be a failure to produce a good next starting point."  And also, I suppose, some constraints are achieved mechanically - a very non-lethal combat system makes it hard to kill players accidentally, GUMSHOE's take on finding clues. (Though this stretches the analogy a bit, it feels like the goal is similar here - an aid in generating the right kind of 'next starting point'.)<br/><br/>Another thing is a parallel that occurs to me.  In many games, a successful player can describe his or her success.  This is a microcosmic railroading. The dice have spoken - the orc's going down.  You can't change that, but the player is now free to describe that however he or she wants to, and I've seen reluctant turtles rise to the challenge with applomb.  A whole chase scene is like a multi-player version of this, and instead of the dice, it's the GM that determined the outcome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_GM_for_Food" title="Will_GM_for_Food"><img alt="Will_GM_for_Food" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_GM_for_Food">Will_GM_for_Food</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345727/#Comment_345727" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-12T16:22:22+00:00" title="October 12, 2011  4:22PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 12, 2011 4:24PM by Will_GM_for_Food.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>All Posted By David Berg</cite>It seems likely to me now that you restrict your ad-lib of Unavoidables to non-problematic situations.</blockquote>\nCorrect. If it's problematic, then there are contraindications, by definition. If there are contraindications, I won't do it.\n<blockquote> So I guess I'm probably looking for an event that you had planned, but didn't tell the players about way in advance.  Probably in Unknown Armies, where the support of an "anything is reversible" genre isn't present.  I'm guessing that implied danger without explicitly established consequences is a good place to look.</blockquote>\nIn Unknown Armies, my Unavoidables are pretty much just set encounters (they'll run into the bully in Scene 3; they'll find the diary in Scene 5; etc.), with one exception:<br/><br/>At the start of the game, I explain two important things. The first is that any time your character fails a stress check, I'll take control of your character. I'll take about 30 seconds of real-world time to narrate how your character gets himself into a sufficiently interesting situation, and then I'll turn control of the character back to you.<br/><br/>Now, because Unknown Armies is a horror game, I have no prohibitions against hurting your character or depleting his resources while he's under my control. In fact, I try to ensure that the character pays some price for freaking out. I won't have your character killed while he freaks out, but I have no problem getting him hurt.<br/><br/>The second important thing is that every character has three Passions: three sets of circumstances which, should they occur, will <i>guarantee</i> that your character loses control. There's no roll. It just happens and I take over.<br/><br/>Obviously, since I design the characters, I select Passions that won't generally come into play often. Ideally, though, each will be invoked at least once during the game.<br/><br/>Now, for many scenarios, I'll have a short list of things I can do to a character in each scene, should one of them freak out. None of these things is truly Unavoidable, because even if there's something scripted in a scene that would trigger one character's Passion, it's always possible that that character won't be present in that scene. That's something that's generally under the player's control. (I say "generally" because there are times when logic dictates that a specific character is in a scene. For example, if the group decides they need to talk to Chuck's stepmother, it makes sense for Chuck to be present for that.)\n<blockquote>*Dear Forge nerds: I'm actually talking about currency in total here, and in this case it's actually positioning.

When the flashback ends and we go to the "24 Hours Earlier" scene, the players are now under the constraint, imposed by the conceit of the adventure, that they have to work their way toward realizing the flashback. I think that would be simultaneously limiting and priming the players for tremendous creativity. I don't think any player that's ever been at my table (and had fun -- there have been a handful for whom my style is not their cup of tea) would balk at such an adventure.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Fuseboy</cite>Another thing is a parallel that occurs to me.  In many games, a successful player can describe his or her success.  This is a microcosmic railroading. The dice have spoken - the orc's going down.  You can't change that, but the player is now free to describe that however he or she wants to, and I've seen reluctant turtles rise to the challenge with applomb.  A whole chase scene is like a multi-player version of this, and instead of the dice, it's the GM that determined the outcome.</blockquote>\nIt's true I've determined the <i>final</i> outcome. But I strongly encourage players to narrate the results of each of their successful die rolls. I tell them up front, "On your turn, I'm not going to ask you what you do. I'm going to ask you what the audience sees." I usually (but not always) narrate the failures, but the players get to narrate their successes. And they've got carte blanche during those narrations.<br/><br/>Just wanted to clarify that.<br/><br/>- Todd                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345743">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345743/#Comment_345743" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-12T19:19:55+00:00" title="October 12, 2011  7:19PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 12, 2011 7:25PM by David_Berg.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Todd,<br/><br/>None of my prompts are working here.  Neither UA Stress Responses (which are communicated in obvious fashion if the GM is <i>at all</i> competent) nor planned encounters (unless a player invests in avoiding that encounter before it happens) are going to generate the sticky situations I'm looking for.

No, I have never had  a player react badly to a constraint that I imposed, even briefly. <br/><br/>I'm not counting the looks of doubt that I've gotten. Many players of traditional games who are new to my table stares at me vacantly when I talk about this "movie thing." They have to see it in action before they understand it. Some of them never get it. Those players have shown signs of confusion when given constraints, but not of violation. I think they were wondering, "So what am I supposed to do, then?" But those players were wondering that throughout the entire game.<br/><br/>I do have many stories of disasters of varying magnitude regarding constraints, though. They occurred when I was still new to my craft, before I made my resolution to just tell players about anything that Had To Be. During this period, I'd have adventures that would hinge on a specific Thing happening in Scene 3. And because it was "against the rules" to tell the players, "This thing happens because it has to," I tried all the usual stupid tricks. For example, I'd ensure the Thing was introduced into the story by making it illogical for the players to not attempt the Thing. Then I'd weight the odds heavily in my favor so that the Thing succeeded or failed as required.<br/><br/>But then the most frustrating things would happen. The players would find a perfectly valid reason to not attempt the Thing. Or they'd try it and, even though the odds of things going south were slim, the dice would humble me and south is exactly where it would go.<br/><br/>It was because of <i>those</i> myriad experiences that I developed the guidelines I use now. They're basically just the inverse of everything that led to one of my past disasters. It's probably because those guidelines were forged in the flames of my personal Hell that they have not failed me yet.<br/><br/>- Todd                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345903/#Comment_345903" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-13T20:15:55+00:00" title="October 13, 2011  8:15PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 13, 2011 8:19PM by David_Berg.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Will GM for Food</cite>The players would find a perfectly valid reason to not attempt the Thing.

"Hey, cool, the players boarded the badguys' ship!  Now they decided they could use it to sneak into enemy turf!  What a neat idea!  They're smart.

The spirits were against them. So they had to go to the old altar in he mountains, and make a blood-sacrifice of a living goat there, before the next full moon. <br/>- so the characters were chosen to do this, them being young and healthy, and very well equipped for the trek. <br/>- and one of the characters had this brother, that was "slow" (mentally retarded). The elders sent him with them, telling them to let no harm come to the simpleton (and he was strong, so he had no problem trekking). <br/><br/>The GMs played the simpleton, and was instructed to play that NPC as much as possible (the heavy railroading made this easy; taking focus away from route-choices and scene-framing). They were told to touch the other players a lot, giving hugs and commending them, as the dumb one. Creating emotional responses and relationships between the dumb and his peers from the village. Those relationships were what the whole game was about.<br/><br/>The GMs were of course warned that all this touching would be awkward at first, but were instructed to persist, and to find different ways of doing it, and being simple and happy by doing it. And if some character/player tried to shy away, they would sulk and go into tears, and saying that "Jobool don't like me! He never hugs me! I am dumb, and he don't like me! For being dumb! No one really like a dumb one!" - etc. And then, if given a small touch on the hand (or something, perhaps a compromise proposed by the GM), he would declare his great love for that character! Instant forgiveness! Persistent relationship-building, massaging the group dynamics through the childish simpleton, was the cornerstone of the scenario. And it was important to portray the simpleton as childish; the innocent "spirit of their village", which they were to protect.<br/><br/>And then, coming to the mountain top, with the age old altar, where they were to sacrifice the goat to save the village, they had lost the goat (Dang! Isn't that typical!). It had been eaten by a dragon on the way (pre-planned scene, and nothing they could do about it). They continued after loosing the goat, of course, having no choice but trying to plead with the spirits (but no spirit ever heed such pitiful pleadings). The moment they got there, and no pleading worked, the GMs were instructed to let the dumb say he wanted to sacrifice himself for the village. <br/><br/>That's the moment when the scenario really happened! Relations blossomed into full fruit, emotions flared, and they (predictably) balked at the idea! But the dumb one insisted that he had always been given gifts in the village; "Give me gifts! Good life! Lots of porridge! Me happy!" He had never been able to give anything in return. "Now, this my chance to give back, to mummy, and village! I never live to be strong, without village! You give gift of life to me! I give life back, as gift!" And the GM was instructed, after a time of debating this, to lay down on top of the gaming table, and instruct the characters/players to cut his wrists: "I lay here, on altar! You kill me! I bleed for you! Love you!"<br/><br/>The death-scenes in these sessions were, without exceptions, scenes of high emotions and tears. The dumb one laying on the table, getting cold, getting fearful of "the dark", dying slowly while his blood dripped for the village, and the characters/players stood in circle trying to comfort him; a lot of touching, holding hands, hugging, tears and repressing tears (to be brave and smiling for him), soothing voices ...<br/><br/>Of course they succeeded! He was sacrificed, and the spirits were appeased. I believe it was the toughest success any of those players had ever had. It was a scenario that focused on the tension between individual and collective, and what meaning there may be in sacrificing yourself for a greater good.<br/><br/>It is one of the strongest scenarios I have ever written and led. <br/>___________________________________<br/><br/>In this scenario it was easy for the players to contribute, due to them knowing what the field of play was. They even contributed with scenes where the characters discussed alternate routes to the mountain, inventing age old routes that had been used before, but concluding that they would be too dangerous now ...<br/><br/>David; my point is; <br/>- if it is crucial that the characters go to "Haven"; <b>SEND THEM THERE!</b> <br/>- if you want them to be in on it; <b>TELL THEM!</b><br/><br/>Don't muddle about. Concentrate your creative energy, and the energy of the players, on what matters to the real drama.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345941/#Comment_345941" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-14T03:21:27+00:00" title="October 14, 2011  3:21AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In this week's game one of the PC got possessed by an evil spirit.

That's hard to guarantee. If you <i>can</i> guarantee it, go for it. But players are notoriously inventive.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Tomas">@Tomas</a>: Love that story!

He is, at last, finding meaning with his life in this sacrifice. All of them ended up with him on the altar, dying.<br/><br/>I forgot to mention that underway to that mountain, the simpleton saved the life of other characters in several of the groups. This was a scenario were players, when loosing their characters, had to leave the game-room. The players were informed this would happen, if they lost their character. It's a technique I use from time to time, to make death a bit more "real", in scenarios were I want an extra acuity to the inter-play. This made some players very much in debt to the simpleton, and they could have offered to stand in his place, of course. They did not. None of them. I believe that is a testimony to the strength of his arguments and convictions.<br/><br/>If a player really had offered to take the place, and sacrifice his character, it might have spelled for a totally different ending. It would have been fine with me. When planning such things, it is important to set a limit to what you decide beforehand. Some things must be be left open, to be the result of inspired and spontaneous interaction. I seldom decide the <i>outcome</i> of any individual encounter. The altar-scene was loaded with arguments for the simpletons sacrifice, but it was not <i>decided</i> that it would end that way. A player character sacrificing himself is fine with me. It would make for a strong scene anyway. The player would have had to take the place on the altar, and be center to the death-scene, and that would have been a strong scene to play out too.<br/><br/>But the arguments made it otherwise. Thinking through arguments beforehand has given me some nice and sharp edges to some scenarios. It's a great thing to do; having NPCs discussing with the PCs, meeting them with really strong logic, or really strong convictions. It's great fun too!<br/><br/>Played a fanatic necromancer once, old and well spoken, who stood before a tyrant and argued nine players/characters/heroes to frustration, with his insistence that having zombies work the field, in dreary manual labor, was good for the farmers morale, and their economy (and ultimately; the economy of the whole tyranny). He was high priest for the goddess <i>Necroma</i>. And what more; he had a really <i>kind</i> demeanor, actually; talking calmly, being patient, and always talking of respect for the dead (and how your grandfather would be proud to help you get a better life). The tyrant let himself be convinced by the priest, and made the evil <i>Necroma</i> the state goddess. And the economy really blossomed! The players lost several discussions with this high priest, getting more and more frustrated. Their arguments that <i>Necroma</i> was evil, of which they had certain knowledge, did not win the day. They were too impatient and aggressive to win the discussions. Boy, did those players tear their hair out! <br/><br/>(they prewailed against evil, in the end, but that was after the grand and evil avatars of <i>Necroma</i> had been called to earth by the widespread practice of necromancy. It was an epic battle, with the heroes winning, but much was destroyed. And they could have won by verbal means, but they were never able to face down that old death-priest in open discussions)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Will GM for Food</cite><a href="/forums/profile/Tomas">@Tomas</a>: Love that story!
