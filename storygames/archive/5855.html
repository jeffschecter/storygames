I'm tinkering with pulp fantasy and sword and sorcery games, which bump into some of the same issues, and currently I don't feel hugely equipped to navigate them. </blockquote>\nThe swords &amp; sorceries in question are specifically and closely modelled on Howard's original Conan stories. I love the exoticism and strangeness of them, and the fact the hero spends most of his time in non-European locales. But there's all this stuff in there that is deeply uncomfortable: the whole of The Vale of Lost Women, for a start, and chunks of Shadows in Zamboula and various others.<br/><br/>I guess I'm after a few different strands of advice. What is it in these stories that's liekly to cause offense (sure, some of it's obvious, but I'm betting some of it's not). And what are ways to deal with it? How can the exoticism and strangeness be preserved without regurgitating old stereotypes or otherwise dehumanising people?<br/><br/>The original question was asked of Julia, but anyone with something to contribute, please chip in!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DainXB" title="DainXB"><img alt="DainXB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DainXB">DainXB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130959/#Comment_130959" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-27T13:02:04+00:00" title="February 27, 2008  1:02PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just re-read Vale of Lost Women this morning in order to pull oracle elements out of it for the <i>IaWA / Conan</i> thread.  As I said in my post there, it contains what I think of as the most racist dialogue Howard ever put in Conan's mouth.  <br/><br/>The thing is, it was written in the '30s, when racist attitudes were common, and it's set in a fantasy version of 'ancient history' when racist attitudes were, if anything, even harsher.  It's not <i>out of character</i> for Conan to disparage the black natives as much as he disparages the white city-dwellers, (As a Cimmerian, he probably feels the same way about the neighboring Vanir tribe back home, and <i>they're</i> white); it's just repugnant to my modern sensibilities, because Conan is supposed to be the character that the reader identifies with.  Not that Conan is acting particularly like a 'good-guy' hero in this story -- he's breaking a treaty, considering blackmailing a woman into sex, and slaughtering a village full of people, some of them non-combatant women.  He also rescues the girl from the monster, and decides not to blackmail her into sex in the end, so I guess that counts for something.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>To get around the blatant racism, when I pulled oracle elements from the story, I mentioned 'civilized' characters and 'savage' characters, without mentioning race or color at all.  (I did use "brown" along with "glowing eyes" in regard to the 'women of the vale', but they are not even technically human, nor are they of any racial stock otherwise appearing in the story.)  If players using those oracle entries have the knee-jerk reaction that 'civilized' characters are white and 'savage' characters aren't, I at least have plausible deniability.  <br/><br/>Actively combating the old stereotypes means aggressively changing them up.  Seth Ben-Ezra's <i>Dirty Secrets</i> game uses racial and economic demographics to organize the various characters -- theres no mechanical effect, but it is a kind of open-ended test of the player's knee-jerk reactions.  Will the players create stereotypical characters or won't they?    <br/><br/>--<br/>DainXB                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130972/#Comment_130972" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-27T13:17:16+00:00" title="February 27, 2008  1:17PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think everybody has a comfort level that balances honoring the source and acknowledging that we are real people playing a game.  I played in a game set in 1913, and my guy was casually racist - a man of the times in a pulpy game that was pretty ahistorical.  It was an interesting experience.  It took a little trust and confidence in my friends.  I thought about it and didn't fall back on "but that's how people were, so it's OK", which is weak sauce to me - I don't care how people were, I care about me and my friends, who are real people talking to each other.  Making my guy an ugly paragon of his times was a choice, and it brought those times into sharp relief with our own and added some depth.  In that way, it contributed to the fun as well.  Chris, you asked:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Chris Gardiner</cite>And what are ways to deal with it?

There's really good stuff here, and I want to have a proper think about it. If I don't post here for a day or so, it's just because I'm cogitating.<br/><br/>Dain - the 'civilised' and 'savage' approach, removing any reference to ethnicity or skin colour from them, is sort of the approach I'd intended to take. But I'm wondering if that's enough - if it's just a token change that, while faintly obscuring the original stereotype, does so quite transparently and weakly. Does that make sense?<br/><br/>Jason - that's an approach I hadn't considered. I think it's really interesting. Initially I thought it might not be suitable in a game that's more escapist and less concerned with introspection, but now I'm not so sure. Like you say, the intention - and the willingness of everyone present to recognise it - is significant, and might work in any game.<br/><br/>Julia - that's a fine start. The problem with it I have is that as someone who has never been the victim of racism, I'm not sure how good I'd be at putting myself in the perspective as someone who has. In the case of asking myself if I'd be embarrassed if in the presence of someone of the same ethnicity as my character, I might be tempted to err on the side of caution and avoid the issue altogether. Which isn't really a solution.<br/><br/>Hope all that makes sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_131023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131023/#Comment_131023" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-27T14:40:13+00:00" title="February 27, 2008  2:40PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Probably the best question I ever asked myself on this subject is: when I generate a character these days, I always ask "why are you making this character the ethnicity the character is?"

It's not a new problem, but it's a difficult one.  I often have a hard time defending my love of Conan, when the awful racism and sexism is so apparent.  And yet, there's almost something about the racisim and sexism that makes the stories so appealing.  This is a hella risky thing to say on the internet, so please, everyone, read as charitably as you can.  <br/><br/>Is it possible to read something that was written with serious intent as parody now?  I guess I don't subscribe to the "authorial intent" idea of criticism.  What that means is that I don't care whether Howard was just repeating the dominant memes of the times.  If it reads as racist, it's racist.  On the other hand, it's SO racisit, it's such an obvious projection of fantasies about race, that reading it now is kinda hilarious.  Like Julia was saying, it's interesting to explore the idea of a world where black or foreign = bad.  Does it matter that when Howard wrote it, it was read "straight"?  It's kinda like cowboys becoming gay icons, because they so embody masculinity.  I think maybe stories like "Conan" can be a vehicle for criticism, or exploration of racism, because they so embody the fantasies of racists.<br/><br/>Of course, this stuff kinda has to be handled like it's uranium. In the wrong hands... <br/><br/>So I guess what I'm saying is that you don't need to excise the racism from Conan to make it cool to play it.  But you do need to be really aware of what you're doing at the table, and be commited to that agenda.  I don't know that I feel very comfortable about doing that personally, but I'd admire the group that did.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy" title="spookyfanboy"><img alt="spookyfanboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/150/384869271_f51cf8bf05.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy">spookyfanboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131046/#Comment_131046" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-27T16:18:22+00:00" title="February 27, 2008  4:18PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Play it straight. <br/><br/>If it makes sense for a villain to be of a particular race, then that's what he is. Likewise, the monsters are alien, monstrous, and in general poisonous to mankind. Heroes are still heroic, but this is pulp-fantasy; if they have to be bastards, they can and will be. <br/><br/>Use it as a way to drive home just how chaotic, brutal, and superstitious the times are. Exaggerate it until it becomes something, like radiation, that soaks into your characters. It's dangerous, but it pays to remind people that the characters and the cast of these types of games simply do not know better. If the players are uncomfortable, then talk before or after about how best to dial it back without breaking the suspension of disbelief. But they should know going into it that it's not high-fantasy: the cost of being a hero as we understand one today is high, high enough that it may even make sense to not be so heroic, and to take what you can get. <br/><br/>This of course assumes a level of trust and maturity that Generic You and Generic Your Group may not have. Always proceed with caution.

If you don't want it to be white people save black people from themselves, it doesn't have to be. Pull back the focus  and it's Harry Dresden does Newark, nothing more.<br/><br/>There's also the flip side of that: the magical negro/colored sidekick who swoops in and saves all the white people, especially the alleged hero, but never takes or gets the credit s/he's due. <br/>Consider Pirates of the Caribbean. I really love these movies. Fun mind candy, sexy scuzzy pirates, hot chick with dreadlocks and a Caribbean accent.  Tia Dalma is a cool character, but they downplayed her abilities in order to let the heroes get their way--at her expense. Why didn't she sink everyone? In the end they all sucked and deserved to drown. I guess that wouldn't have been the Disney version.<br/><br/>So I have an aversion to playing magical negro-types, even though they can be pretty fun to play (because who doesn't like being magical?). For example, I played the same character in Poison'd in three different games. Her name was Abyssinia, she was a Barbary Pirate, she had no magical powers and didn't believe in the magic. I didn't want her to be another Tia Dalma. In the last game I played her, there was all kinds of "magical" stuff happening. It never really came up, but I imagined her thinking to herself, "crazy Europeans with their dumbass sorcery. There are better ways to get into hell."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_131455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131455/#Comment_131455" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-28T17:31:15+00:00" title="February 28, 2008  5:31PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Parthenia</cite>Rob, think of it this way: Harry Dresden<i>can</i>save people because he's special, and Newark, NJ is a pretty diverse town.

I'm guessing that most of the characters will be white, but I'll ask, "Hey, are we all white people saving black people?" if that happens <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
