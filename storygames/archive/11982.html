Prophet! Seriously: good work! Get the people into role-playing! They grow with it!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tore Vange</cite>Wrote a 100 page scenario in three days (It was crap, but I was young and proud).</blockquote>Of course you where proud! I was too, first time I wrote a scenario (that was too long, and crappy beyond belief). I'm still proud of daring to do it, and trying to play it!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tore Vange</cite>Never used a published module.

Deciding to GM my first game. This was WFRP 1st Ed - The Enemy Within. 3 out of the 4 players had never played RPGs before. All of them still do.<br>3. Joining a roleplaying society. And therefore being exposed to more games.<br>4. Playing Masks of Nyarlathotep. A milestone because this made me realise a game could be fun without combat.<br>5. Being informed by the players at the society that i was perhaps the best GM they had ever played with.<br/>6. Being told..."what shocked me was the realisation that I knew which NPC was talking to me just based on how you played them and they had their own goals, motivations and agendas and your plot stemmed from that not some quest"<br/>7. Being one of the three founder members of a new roleplaying society. And then helping it gain 120 regular members in 6 months (it did not last unfortunately)<br/>8. Playing in a 4 year campaign that made narrative sense. <br/>9. Walking away from RPGs when I realised all I had on offer was bad gaming...and therefore realising that not gaming was in fact superior.<br/>10. Finding yet another society to game with...and running for 6 strangers on my first week there...and being told that "wow you are really awesome as a GM"<br/>11. Having the same group of people smile when they realised that my combats in my cybperpunk game were as lethal as I had warned them if they did not think about it.<br/>12. Running my first HQ Glorantha game and having a large group of skeptics fall in love with it.<br/><br/>I have probably missed a lot out.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
