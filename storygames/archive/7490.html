However, a question surfaced in the after-game discussion: isn't there any mechanical incentives for keeping up discipline in the military ranks?<br/><br/>We talked about this a bit with some of the players, and it seemed pretty weird to us that, apparently, there is no punishment at all for just walking up to your commanding officer, shooting him and claiming a field promotion. The only restraint, it seems, is the possible retaliation from other player characters; thing like whether you commit this murder on live TV have no bearing, as the GM doesn't seem to have any way to proffer discipline from the military apparatus.<br/><br/>Looking at the rules closely, one might argue that NPCs actually have mechanical weight in that they have wounds and can be killed with FA checks - so they presumably could also kill you back. So then we have this lieutenant and his 30 men who can actually defend themselves from the overzealous PC who's after a promotion. But then, what do you do when the deed's already accomplished and the murderer caught red-handed? Or, for that matter, when the PC has done something less extreme, such as disobeyed orders?<br/><br/>The natural solution, to me, would be to pile in some rules for military tribunals and less severe discipline actions, but it also seems to me that this obvious material is conspiciously absent from the rules of the game. It wouldn't be that difficult to just say that, for example, a high officer can pick a given grunt team for a "suicide mission" as a mark of displeasure, which'd incur +2 Threat for the next mission. Or, an individual character might be officially punished by taking away any non-regulation weapons - both of course avoidable with NFA checks in the mission briefing. But this sort of stuff is explicitly not in the rules, which leaves one to wonder whether it's a flaw, or whether this stuff was omitted with good reason.<br/><br/>This is all the more weird when you consider that the theme of the game pretty much <i>is</i> military discipline. There is a strong incentive to push the boundaries of given orders and try to weasel your way into position to influence your own fate and that of others, including the whole fleet, potentially. So considering this, it seems obvious to me that characters are disobeying all over the place with no rules-based discipline at all. Already in our game we had soldiers disobeying all sorts of direct orders from their superiors, but we couldn't really do much aside from fitting the fiction into the mechanical facts.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage" title="Number6intheVillage"><img alt="Number6intheVillage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.johnkantor.com/miscl/prisoner_ringtiny.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage">Number6intheVillage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166321/#Comment_166321" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-31T11:08:54+00:00" title="August 31, 2008 11:08AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And this is different from real life how?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166322/#Comment_166322" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-31T11:14:17+00:00" title="August 31, 2008 11:14AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't thought about this, but I guess I'd just assume this is a case of "use common sense" and "choose whatever makes the story cool".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166323/#Comment_166323" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-31T11:35:10+00:00" title="August 31, 2008 11:35AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There really don't need to be any mechanical enforcement of discipline that isn't already present: the ability to kill or restrain using FA and NFA checks.

And by "remove" I mean "remove by the way of overwhelming force, pouring in however many MPs are needed to get one soldier under control". The lack of any rules on the topic really leaves us with either adding them, not caring of what the characters do, or removing the infringing character altogether.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166329/#Comment_166329" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-31T12:31:46+00:00" title="August 31, 2008 12:31PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, so you're looking for ideas on how a soldier might be punished?<br/><br/>Well, there's the ever-present "corrective training", usually consisting of physical training (exercise like pushups, etc.) on the spot, or onerous physical labor, sometimes completely pointless physical labor. Examples from my personal experience include soldiers clipping the bushes and grass with scissors while wearing their body armor and helmet. <br/><br/>Then there's "extra duty", which means duty on the soldier's personal time, usually being janitorial or lawn care kind of stuff, combined with restriction from priveleges for a given duration. The U.S. Army tends to do extra duty from 7 days to 45 days, with restriction for the same period to the immediate unit's area, lasting from close-of-business to midnight on work days and from 0700 hrs to midnight on non-duty days. <br/><br/>There's also forfeiture of pay, some benefits, reduction in rank... <br/><br/>In cases when it goes to courts martial, prison time and removal from service are punitive options. <br/><br/>In cases of treason or conduct that endangers the life of your soldiers, the army does have a policy that can include execution, though I am not certain of the last time that was exercised. <br/><br/>In the fictional world of 3:16, you would probably see execution figure more prominently. I could also see "wall-to-wall counseling" (a euphemism for an asskicking) being exercised pretty frequently. If you've read the actual book of Starship Troopers, a problem with a trooper being disobedient and disrespectful was settled when Rico (the leader in this case) met with the trooper in the locker room, and they beat the hell out of each other. When it was over, Rico had earned the trooper's respect, and there weren't any more problems. This sort of thing might actually lead to officers who get respect because they've earned it from their junior leaders in backroom brawls, in addition to making sound decisions that take care of their subordinates.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166330/#Comment_166330" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-31T12:32:58+00:00" title="August 31, 2008 12:32PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems to me that this is one of the fruitful territories for story that 3:16 gives you. These situations are going to come up, so what are you, as GM, going to do with them in the story? Here's how I'd approach it.<br/><br/>Shooting the LT in the back and not being seen doing it is an NFA check.<br/>So the LT acts like an ass and treats the troopers like shit. Will they frag him now?<br/>So now the LT is sending them on a suicide mission and denying them the resources they need. Will they do it now?<br/>Now the LT is *leading* them on a suicide mission, babbling about how he's going to win eternal glory, go down and a blaze of glory, and how lucky the PCs are to be able to join him. Do they frag him now?<br/>Here the opportunity is all about what the troopers will do and under what conditions they'll do it.<br/><br/>So now let's say the troopers have done something really bad. They fragged the LT, or they let the alien go, or they scrubbed the mission then lied about it.<br/>They get called up before the review board. That's an NFA check.<br/>If they fail, it's an opportunity to frame them into an even nastier scene and ratchet the story up a notch.<br/>Now the troopers are being sent on a no-return mission to hellworld with a nuclear bomb strapped to their dropship.<br/>Or they're being left to cover the rear while the fleet jumps to safety.<br/>Of the offending trooper has an explosive collar fitted to his neck and the baddest-ass commissar in the fleet has his finger on the button.<br/><br/>What its *not* about is "realism" of any kind. Removing a PC from the campaign for breaking discipline is probably a mistake. If anything, this game is about breaking discipline and taking the consequences.<br/><br/>Actually, I take that back, it's about the interplay between breaking the rules for survival or any other reason, and making the rules because you finally got promoted high enough to do it. Problem is, there's always another asshole one rung above you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166336/#Comment_166336" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-31T13:35:54+00:00" title="August 31, 2008  1:35PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess you lose me somewhat at "it's an opportunity to frame them into an even nastier scene", Tony. From the mechanical viewpoint there are no nastier scenes - there is nobody pushing back if a player decides to push, even just a little bit. Of course this is fine if the player's have an understanding of the fact and thus won't push, or will push only if they are ready to take the fluff consequences seriously. It's just surprising to me that there are so few possibilities for actually, mechanically making the life of the characters more difficult even in little ways when the game is all about disobedience towards authority. If you weren't supposed to be disobeying authority, then the lack of rules concerning the consequences of such would be easier to understand. As it is, it seems to me that there are essentially two sorts of disobedience - the cool kind where you have your character take the power of the fleet discipline seriously, and the other kind, where you just act directly against the asshole PC/NPC and don't worry about the (entirely fluff) consequences. The gravitas of murdering a superior officer in cold blood to save your skin seems to be considerably less when you realize that you're only staking fictional consequences, not anything the game actually tracks. No new mode comes in for the game or anything like that when your character goes rogue - either you continue to follow the game's increasingly straining format, or you start improvising outside it, or you end the game as regards that character or in toto. It seems that the latter is the preferred solution when the campaign is "ending", but I don't really know how to deal with the mutinous impulse before then.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166358/#Comment_166358" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-31T17:18:49+00:00" title="August 31, 2008  5:18PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2008 5:19PM by John_Harper.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a case where you follow the fiction with the game system (which is what Tony is saying, too. Shooting the Lt. is an FA check, though, not NFA.)<br/><br/>You try to shoot your Lieutenant. It's a fight, almost certainly. Dominance, then FA checks (or you can use NFA to cause exhaustion), success does a kill (3:16 p. 45, 46). Are there witnesses? Do you try to kill them, too? They probably fight back. If the Lt. has men loyal to him, they fight back, too. In those cases, the mutinous trooper probably dies. Fighting more than one NPC, alone, is basically impossible.<br/><br/>So maybe you want to arrange for the Lt. to be alone somewhere so you can kill him all quiet like. NFA check to arrange it. Then it's a fight again, probably with a Dominance bonus and if you Ambush the Lt. is screwed.<br/><br/>But what if you're caught on video or otherwise found out? You go before a court martial. NFA check! Probably opposed, using AA. Success means you either convince them it was justified, or you were framed, or you're too well connected to be punished. Whatever. Failure and it's the brig for you -- or an airlock -- depending on the tone of your game.<br/><br/>Will your fellows try to bust you out of the brig? Manipulate the JAG to suspend your sentence? Maybe. But probably not. You'll rot in prison. Time for a replacement.<br/><br/>What if you flat out disobey an order out in the open in front of everybody? Maybe the Lt. decides to punish you. We're back to fighting, again -- but if you fight back at all, you might be headed to that court martial. Maybe the Lt. gives you a crap duty as punishment. You want to shirk it? NFA check. You tell him to fuck off? The MPs are called in. There are several. Fight them all and (probably) die or take your chances with the court.<br/><br/>It's like that. Just follow the fiction along and see where it goes. If there's fighting, FA. If something else becomes a problem, NFA. Let the successes and failures guide the consequences and form the new situation. Don't be afraid to go all the way to horrible outcomes (imprisonment and execution) and also don't worry about it if the PC succeeds and avoids the punishments. Good for them. If they're constantly killing their superiors and disobeying orders without any guile or subterfuge, eventually those MPs are gonna show up in sufficient numbers to take them down. They push their luck when they buck the system and they have to be ready to deal with the fallout.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166364">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage" title="Number6intheVillage"><img alt="Number6intheVillage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.johnkantor.com/miscl/prisoner_ringtiny.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage">Number6intheVillage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166364/#Comment_166364" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-31T18:03:51+00:00" title="August 31, 2008  6:03PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>We talked about this a bit with some of the players, and it seemed pretty weird to us that, apparently, there is no punishment at all for just walking up to your commanding officer, shooting him and claiming a field promotion.

Perhaps it's better to simply start making up that replacement character immediately when guilt has been established in the military establishment - in trial or on live TV, whatever. By which I mean, instead of waiting for the character to get executed or indefinitely imprisoned, count "going rogue" as an end for the character as well; as the game is about soldiers, it's pretty reasonable to determine that any character who decides to no longer care about that authority at all is outside the scope of the game, really.<br/><br/>The general rule of thumb seems to be that you can get away with anything with a successful NFA check, and the only possible significant consequence of insubordination is being removed from the game, permanently or slightly less so. That's high stakes, and the GM needs to make some heavy decisions all by himself about whether a given infraction justifies removing the character or just warrants fluff punishment. But I guess that can be dealt with by an experienced GM, who warns the player beforehand that a given course of action will require a NFA check later to avoid getting his character removed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166410/#Comment_166410" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-01T02:31:49+00:00" title="September  1, 2008  2:31AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, Eero...

Does anyone ask for an NFA roll to dodge out of it? Or make it look like they did follow the order when they actually didn't? If not then does someone want to have a conflict over it? <br/><br/>If you have a conflict then that can be ended by accepting the order, or the order being dropped, or one side being killed (if you take it all the way). Is bucking the order worth dying for? Is killing someone to make them follow an order the best way to have your orders followed?<br/><br/>I think if the whole squad rebelled it would be pretty clear that you were now "Righteous Troopers" facing "Corrupt Troopers" and the GM would have to use Threat Tokens to face the squad down, right?<br/><br/>Read the example about Frinks putting Smile on Latrine Duty.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166415">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166415/#Comment_166415" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-01T03:46:31+00:00" title="September  1, 2008  3:46AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I get the impression that Eero's main question is about the degree of GM Fiat involved in choosing the level of opposition in PC vs. NPC conflict. Now this doesn't bother me at all, but I can see his point that, given that you have complex pacing / threat level mechanics for aliens (abilitiy, special powers, tokens), having nothing at all for NPC opposition might seem odd.<br/><br/>So what is your advice, Gregor, for how a GM worried about abuse of power should be choosing the threat level of NPC opposition (e.g. the squad of MPs mentioned above). Would it be practical to run it like a planet, picking an AA level from the list and giving the officers a threat token allocation?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166420/#Comment_166420" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-01T04:41:34+00:00" title="September  1, 2008  4:41AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David, it's on p.46 under "PC versus NPC conflicts".
