Most of the time, I discover them when they just happen to be mentioned here on SG or on blogs I read. Since "boosting the signal" is so important to make small presses &amp; self-publishers be successful, wouldn't it be nice if we kept a thread going just for this purpose?<br/>Furthermore, I suggest re-starting this thread monthly, or maybe quarterly - to keep the new stuff from being preceded by a zillion no-more-relevant posts a year from now, when a new or returning user first clicks on the thread.<br/><br/>TL;DR = Any new games for sale, for free or being crowdfunded? Please post a line here. </blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461891/#Comment_461891" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-12T08:27:03+00:00" title="April 12, 2017  8:27AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I present to you the new <b><a href="https://teylen.wordpress.com/2017/04/11/crowdfunding-list-37/" rel="nofollow">Crowdfunding List <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2337&amp;Mode=like">#37</a></a></b>, which includes <b>every project started between 20.03 till 10.04.</b> and still running.<br/><br/>Facing a total of 82 project, of which 20 are tabletop core books, I couldn\u2019t muster the energy to give each project a small blurbs or even take a closer look at every project.

For foreign language projects I wrote a sentence or two. If a project has no picture, something about it took me off.<br/><br/>Still there are a great many exciting project.

Some of these games are brand new; some are revised and updated versions of games that have won prestigious indie gaming awards like the ENnies, Golden Cobra, and the 200WordRPG contest. All seven games offer a play experience you've never had before, which is why we think you should back this project now.<br/><br/>This Kickstarter campaign is raising money to pay all nine contributors (seven designers, an editor, and a layout artist) a fair wage. Each contributor is being paid royalties, which means the more we raise, the more each contributor earns. If we pass our initial goal, we will add additional art and game content as stretch goals to thank you for your support. Our first stretch goal is additional illustration by designer/artist Tim Hutchings.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461900/#Comment_461900" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-12T15:25:19+00:00" title="April 12, 2017  3:25PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1080999837/the-imposters/description" rel="nofollow">The Imposters</a> is an anthology of seven tabletop and live-action roleplaying games from seven different designers.</blockquote>\nWow (immediately impulse-backed)! Looks like it's anthology book time, down to a common undercurrent of retro-fashionable in the KS videos, even! In fact...<br/><br/>Despite it being already included in <a href="/forums/profile/Teylen%27s">@Teylen's</a> very comprehensive collection, I can't help but give a shout out to a project I personally have a stake in:<br/><br/><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1458963638/crescendo-giocoso" rel="nofollow">Crescendo Giocoso</a> is an anthology of small-scale, "chamber" larp scenarios by Italian authors.<br/><br/>It's a big (400-page) and gorgeous (I know 'cause I had a proof in my hands ten days ago) book which is bound to make role-playing look cool to the non-geeky friends who'll happen to peruse it on your coffee table. It includes a dozen (or more, in case stretch goals are met!) game scenarios ranging from 2 to 30 players, half of them by the very talented Oscar Biffi, our project leader. I'm just a co-author to one of the scenarios, but I feel really proud to be part of it (in case you're wondering, I'm the guy in a top-hat).<br/>These games are part of a distinctively Italian tradition which owes something to Forge and post-Forge English-language story-games, Vampire larps, British freeform, Danish Fastaval scenarios, Swedish Jeepform, Finnish chamber larps, "black box" games, "American freeform" and more, but is definitely a beast of its own. "Character sheets" amounting to biographies and detailed personality descriptions are often provided, rule-sets always kept to a strictly functional minimum, theatrics and costuming optional.<br/>Possibly interesting to some in the Story Games crowd is that Oscar has chosen, for this anthology, to break with the tradition of host-organizer figures in Italian larp, and instead required all scenarios to be rewritten as a set of instructions addressed to players: these are "GM-less" larps, possibly the very first ones ever designed in Italy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ParadoxBoy" title="ParadoxBoy"><img alt="ParadoxBoy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ParadoxBoy">ParadoxBoy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461975/#Comment_461975" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-15T21:58:37+00:00" title="April 15, 2017  9:58PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just finished putting together <a href="http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/209750/Portal-Rats" rel="nofollow">Portal Rats</a>, my The Black Hack-based love letter to planar adventuring.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kyleweems" title="kyleweems"><img alt="kyleweems" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/856/nI5M0EM1PN1HG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kyleweems">kyleweems</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462014/#Comment_462014" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-16T16:21:04+00:00" title="April 16, 2017  4:21PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I released <a href="http://games.kyleweems.io/deadpuncher/" rel="nofollow">Deadpuncher</a>, a game about the punching dead (and punching the dead).
