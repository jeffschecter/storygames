Like camping? Like the woods?<br/><br/>Like loose, informal, relaxed gaming and camping in the woods?<br/><br/>Like helping out, making your own fun, and taking care of others while gaming and camping with around 100-or-so likeminded people? In the woods?<br/><br/>Role-playing games, LARPs, board and strategy games, card games--whatever people want to run. There's even a kid's track this year (but parents have to keep an eye on their kids!).<br/><br/>Camp Nerdly is May 13-15 in Prince William Forest Park, Virginia (near Quantico, just south of DC). It's $65 for a grown-up and that includes a cot in a cabin, all the food, and all the gaming for the entire weekend. There's just a few more weeks left to register!<br/><br/><a href="http://www.campnerdly.org/\ufeff" rel="nofollow">Camp Nerdly website</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
