More akin to a Killoren or Wilden (4e) or dryad.<br/><br/>These elves are tree-like fey. They are slender and graceful, but are much more feral in appearance. Their bones are hardwood, and their supple, barklike skin trails into viny tendrils and a cloak of leaves. As wilden age. their bodies move through the seasons. Young wilden are like trees in spring, filled with life and vigor. Their bodies a green hue. In the Summer phase. a widen's body is brown or tan, while the cloak of leaves remains vibrant green. Wilden in the autumn phase undergo a profound change, their skin darkening as their leaves turn color to reds, yellows, and oranges. Finally. the winter phase heralds the end of a wilden's life, as the body grows thinner and the wilden's leaves wither and fall. Each phase is around 100 years, so lifespan is 400 years.<br/><br/>As with the other fairies, they cannot abide the touch of cold iron. They also have a fear fires (anything greater than a lit torch or campfire). They have excellent vision in twilight or under moonlight\u2014though not in complete darkness. They have an aptitude for wilderness survival skills and can communicate with the animals of the forest. They can also cast faerie/glamour magic (natural\u2014no spellbook needed). They are attuned to the wild and while outdoors in natural surrounding, they gain bonuses on Dexterity and Wisdom. They have Second Sight as the other fairies. They are immune to charm and sleep spells. Hide ability when in their natural environment.<br/><br/>They do not wear armor. In battle, their skin turns hard as bark (natural armor)\u2014AC increases as they level. They are unrivaled in their skills with a bow.<br/><br/>This is the starting point, I need to tweak a bit. Also need to look at the dryad more closely. <br/><br/>Suggestions?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469852/#Comment_469852" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-09T15:54:05+00:00" title="February  9, 2018  3:54PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Any interesting cultural elements?  Sometimes those will inspire specific strengths and weaknesses, powers and limitations.  Are they more like Tolkein's Ents or more like ElfQuest's Wolfriders?  What sorts of communities do they live in -- large, small, isolated, intermingled with other races, etc.?  Any particular religious/spiritual traditions?<br/><br/>Supposing a Wilden wound up in a D&amp;D adventuring party, what would that mean?  Does mainstream Wilden culture view that sort of thing with esteem, indifference, disgust, or what?  What expectations with the Wilden be bringing in regarding their adventuring comrades based on Wilden views?<br/><br/>I could imagine any of this informing details about how they sleep, reproduce, deal with different sorts of dangers, etc.<br/><br/>Two random ideas:<br/>- They could be very susceptible to fire.  Maybe moreso when using barkskin.<br/>- They could be poisonous, and inflict poison damage on creatures who damage them with bite attacks.<br/><br/>Finally, casting faerie magic with no spellbook and being immune to charm and sleep sounds like a very powerful package.  I hope it balances well with your other character options.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469868">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vgunn" title="vgunn"><img alt="vgunn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vgunn">vgunn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469868/#Comment_469868" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-09T21:56:00+00:00" title="February  9, 2018  9:56PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a> Thanks for the response!<br/><br/>When I started looking into this Elfquest certainly came to mind as well as the Dryads and Wood Elves of Warhammer along with Birthright Elves. <br/><br/>For my setting they are an ancient race\u2014long asleep\u2014who awoke at the Breaking of the World. There is only one race of elves and they are innately tied forests. These elves had no contact with humankind for countless years. After the cataclysm, those humans who survived eventually recovered and began migrating westward. They cut or burned down large tracts of forests. The elves fought back, but in the end knew that peace was the only choice for survival. The treaty allowed for wilderness preservations where the elves could dwell in solitude (like untamed islands surrounded by an ocean of humanity). They are a reclusive race, suspicious of humankind and many still harbor ill-will because of their forced containment. <br/><br/>Each of these forests has a Heartwood, where an Elf-Queen holds court. Heartwood is where their lives originate from and where they will return to upon their deaths. The Heartwood is also home to many other fairies. An elven wood can be deadly perilous for human travelers, woodcutters and peasants gathering firewood are slain as brutally as warriors. There elven war bands charged with keeping their homelands free from outsiders. Beautiful, but alien, to behold they have a core of savagery that permeates their being.<br/><br/>Most elves are xenophobic and reclusive. However, there are some who take a more pragmatic  view and look to humans for ways to improve relations and increase cooperation. They will leave their woods\u2014often shunned by their own kind\u2014to find adventure and beat back the tide of evil growing on the far west borderlands. A few are overcome by an irresistible wanderlust to travel beyond the elven forests\u2014moving from one place to another, always observing but rarely making contact with the folk they meet. Elves have a foundness for trinkets (those not found in their woods) almost like the way Hobbits have Mathoms. <br/><br/>Most humans view them with disdain and distrust, but also realize they can be powerful allies. So they are tolerated as adventurers. <br/><br/>Not sure how in-depth I want to go with sleeping habits, reproduction, and so on\u2014maybe leaving some blank spots for others to adapt to their own campaigns.<br/><br/>Yes, fire and cold iron they are very susceptible to.<br/><br/>I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be overpowered, once I tighten it all down.<br/> <br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469871/#Comment_469871" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-09T23:27:51+00:00" title="February  9, 2018 11:27PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 9, 2018 11:28PM by David_Berg.">edited February 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The configuration w.r.t. humans and forests and great trees reminds me of Pandora from Avatar.  That might be a good reference to see what parts you like and don't like, so as to use or break expectations accordingly.<br/><br/>Sounds like Wilden adventurers are probably outliers, curious folks who reject the general xenophobia, right?  It might be interesting to play with the extent to which they're accepting/rejecting their heritage.  I could imagine different sets of skills and powers for the "My kin are all backwards, I'm here to take in the larger world" Wilden and the "I'm adventuring for some particular reason but staying true to my roots is super important" Wilden.  I dunno.  I'm not seeing any obvious gaps where you need more content.  If you're looking for anything in particular, maybe let us know?<br/><br/>Oh, hey, they could totally eat people.  I don't see why they wouldn't.  They could totally hunt and eat them like any other animal when circumstances permit.<br/><br/>BTW, FWIW I like "Wilden" much better than "Elves" for these creatures.  I could also see humans calling them "treefolk", "wooden people", "forest devils" or something similar.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vgunn" title="vgunn"><img alt="vgunn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vgunn">vgunn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469873/#Comment_469873" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-10T01:00:31+00:00" title="February 10, 2018  1:00AM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a> I hadn't thought of Avatar, not a fan but might be something there to glean. <br/><br/>Yes, they would be outliers and some reasoning for race-as-class.<br/><br/>I believe there is a setting where the Elves are cannibalistic--don't remember the name.<br/><br/>Thinking of going with Walden (or Elfin) for the name.

Are you going to present this as "Here are the elves in this world" or more like "There are no elves in this setting, but you might find the Wilden interesting..."?<br/><br/>I am curious why the skill with the bow?  It doesn't jive with the other stuff to me.  Also, making bows and arrows out of wood seems like it could even perhaps be considered some kind of blasphemy to their people.  They aren't like elves who are capable of crafting fine things out of natural materials, but their bodies are themselves comprised of such natural materials, or at least so closely attuned with it.<br/><br/>It's interesting to me to see how different things matter to different people.  You clearly spent a lot of time on the visual and somatic impressions these people elicit.  Whereas David is more curious about how Wilden characters will interact with other characters in play.  I think this is more what I would be interested in, too.  In fact, the best way to interest me into a race or a class is just give me five very juicy bullet points to give me ideas about how I will play them.

Do they use bone and stone instead?<br/><br/>If they are primarily plant-based, do they even need to eat as we know it or do they have some sort of system where nutrition gets sucked as a liquid via various tubes. If that's the case, is there a communal 'compost/liquidiser' pit where organic waste and mulch (including the bodies of dead enemies) gets thrown?<br/><br/>With all the other bonuses they seem to be getting, I would be looking at giving penalties to being underground/inside rather than bonuses to being outside.<br/><br/>I'd agree about the bow issue.

My GURPS Saduria elves share many of the ideas you have presented, being primarily sentient plant-based life-forms.

I\u2019d think that those who chose to go adventuring in a human-centric world wouldn\u2019t want to appear too alien or jarring to their companions.<br/><br/>They are stealthy and slight, so attacking from afar makes more sense for them. Plus, giving some aspects of their \u2018elvishness\u2019 is fine for me and I want them to be available as PCs.<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vgunn" title="vgunn"><img alt="vgunn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vgunn">vgunn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470640/#Comment_470640" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-13T21:12:14+00:00" title="March 13, 2018  9:12PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" rel="nofollow">David_Berg</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Another bit of thought-fodder: "The Green" a la Swamp Thing.
