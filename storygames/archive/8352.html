I\u2019m trying to combine four ingredients into a soup, and like a maimed chef with poor vision and no sense of smell, I\u2019m probably going to butcher it.  Here\u2019s a shot and I hope it makes sense.  Here\u2019s what we\u2019ve got in the pot:\n<ul><li>Running a Burning Wheel Game</li>\n<li>Setting is Azeroth (from the Warcraft game), circa Warcraft III.</li>\n<li>Heroes are captains in Arthas\u2019 army, telling their own stories with the backdrop of Arthas going mad and becoming the Lich King</li>\n<li>Like in MLWM the end is inevitable, we\u2019ve all agreed on that.  So knowing if Arthas turns bad is not the question.  The question is what becomes of his captains.  I can very much see this working like what becomes of the minions in MLWM.</li></ul>\nI was just reading Vincent Bakers\u2019s page (<a href="http://www.lumpley.com/hardcore.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lumpley.com/hardcore.html</a>) and on 2-5-04 he talks about suspense and how suspense doesn\u2019t come from unknown outcomes, but from wondering what the protagonists will have to do to get them.  Will Batman defeat the Joker and save Gotham? Of Course, but what does he have to do (or become) to do it?<br/><br/>So I\u2019m looking at the current campaign.  Just as it starts, Arthas is still all happy sunshine and righteous, but the players are already messing with him.  All of his captains have their own agendas and they use their relationship with him as a weapon against each other.  He\u2019s like the big giant Magoffin of the story.  It\u2019s very clear that we can see why he would have gone nuts if he really had this kind of support (or lack there of).<br/><br/>In the current engagement, knights have been captured by the demonic orcs and the troupes seek to rescue these 8 men.  The encampment is heavily fortified but we know that they will be defeated.  We know it with certainty.  <br/><br/>Here is where all the ideas collide.  Since I know this with certainty, I want to make that a mechanic.  I want to create some measure of suffering that the characters will have to endure in order to make this happen.  I want the question to turn away from, will we rescue the knights, and into what will happen to the captains, their troops, their sanity, and their relationships in order to rescue those knights and defeat the orcs.  <br/><br/>So, can you hack BW?  Can MLWM elements be added in?  Right now my head is in a spin just trying to keep all these ideas in one place.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184621">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pete" title="Pete"><img alt="Pete" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pete">Pete</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184621/#Comment_184621" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-22T12:07:20+00:00" title="December 22, 2008 12:07PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sean Nittner</cite>"<i>I want the question to turn away from, will we rescue the knights, and into what will happen to the captains, their troops, their sanity, and their relationships in order to rescue those knights and defeat the orcs.</i>"</blockquote>\nSo turn the question away: <i>"Folks, the question is no longer will we rescue the knights - because we will - but rather what will it cost us to do so."</i> Remembering that when there is no conflict we say yes, the players agree with you, they say yes, and so there is no need to roll dice or cook up a mechanic.

The GM doesn't have to be bastard, the system does it for him.  In fact, in most cases the players bring on their own pain.  While I'm comfortable being a bastard (especially after being the Master in MLWM) it takes a lot of energy.  I'm physically tolled playing the roll of the disgruntled sergeant yelling and spitting in the face of his captain, or slamming my fist in the table to represent Arthas' rage at the Captains' actions.  Also, I find that when players know what they are giving up, what they are risking (e.g. Exhaustion and Madness in DRYH) they are much less likely to take it personally then when the GM just nails their character.  I want beat up characters, not players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Nittner" title="Sean Nittner"><img alt="Sean Nittner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Nittner">Sean Nittner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184632/#Comment_184632" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-22T14:08:02+00:00" title="December 22, 2008  2:08PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, can anyone tell me (or point me where to find) info on the pain mechanics in Darkpages?

What are you willing to <i>become</i>?" are used in a few places in the text).  But with the option to choose failure, if the price for success is too hideous.  It does this partially through the Push mechanic, by which you "buy" the points (or "successes," were you to apply the concept to BW) you need to succeed a roll -- the Price is the difference between what you rolled and what you need.  There are three pools of abstract points (Blood, Sweat, and Tears) that you can use to pay the Price, and they have no effect until you run out (in which case you're incapacitated and even, in the case of Blood, actively dying) -- but you want to save those for when they count, because the other possible Prices are all things that immediately compromise the character, such as injuries, the loss of or damage to equipment, the loss of crucial time, the occurrence of some dangerous and compromising event.  The GM offers a choice of two or three Prices (at least one of which must be either Blood, Sweat, or Tears), and the player chooses which one.  Or chooses not to Push -- chooses to Give instead, in which case he takes his failure and likes it.<br/><br/>The other way it does it is that the GM, representing forces of corruption, encourages said corruption by presenting situations in which the corrupt choices are mechanically easier.  In fact, he sets difficulty ratings for the "clean" paths based on how badly the character wants his goal.  In order to make the prospective gain closer to the prospective cost, and to make the corruption that much more attractive, you see.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
