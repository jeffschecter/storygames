This, of course, is what the other players do when they generate a character.<br/><br/>Something like the fronts in Dungeon World are the kind of thing that I'm thinking of, but they're not constrained enough. You don't have to use them and you can make them up on the fly, and even when you use them they're not as big a part of the game as a player character's character sheet is.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448932/#Comment_448932" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-08T10:23:24+00:00" title="October  8, 2015 10:23AM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wonder if <b>My Life with Master</b> comes close to this?

We must be getting VERY different vibes from the OP, because what it sounds like to me doesn't really sound anything like a classic D&amp;D dungeon.<br/><br/>Anyway, from reading the subject of this post, my first thought was "Ryuutama" since there the GM has a CHARACTER, who has a character sheet.  But it seems that's not actually what is being asked at all.<br/><br/>Agon does something SORTOF like  this, in that the GM has constrained resources with which to make life hard for the PCs.  It doesn't "thematically" restrict his choices - he's still free to challenge the party with a gorgon, or a raging river, or whatever - but he's limited in how dangerous his threats can be.  There's no determination made about this at game start, however.<br/><br/>So I'm going to go with "No, there is no game that restricts the GM to 'their prep'" since it sounds like really, that's what you're asking for.  For the GM to pick some stuff before play begins and then be essentially forbidden from modifying it.  The reason for this is that players can inevitably be trusted to go way off the map, and prep is finite by definition, so you'd basically be dooming the game.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi" title="yukamichi"><img alt="yukamichi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nHW6876KEN77F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">yukamichi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448940/#Comment_448940" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-08T14:23:55+00:00" title="October  8, 2015  2:23PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Card Ranker, a game based heavily on "battling card game" shows like Yu-gi-oh, has scenarios built around the idea of an antagonist NPC called the Dark Ranker. They're more or less built like a regular PC (which in itself makes them unique compared to any other NPC in the game, who wouldn't have significant stats), but they also act similar to the PCs in that they are restrained in their actions by the mechanics of the game.<br/><br/>The game has at its core a fairly rigid turn structure, where each player/character gets to have their own scene in turns, each with its own specific mechanical objective (such as acquiring new cards for your deck, forming a bond with another character, uncovering the Dark Ranker's desire, and cetera), and the scenario itself has a set turn turn limit in which the PCs attempt to accomplish their objectives and prepare for their final showdown with the Dark Ranker. The Dark Ranker also gets their own scene each round, and they are allowed some unique actions and abilities that allow them to obstruct the PCs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448941/#Comment_448941" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-08T14:54:26+00:00" title="October  8, 2015  2:54PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Airk">@Airk</a>, I still think a classic D&amp;D dungeon is this. &lt;=) Prepare the dungeon before play, stick to what is prepared, don't add or change anything. <br/><br/>Also, the Parsley games are like this, because the GM doesn't actually get to prep anything.
