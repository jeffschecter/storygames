One of those players is leaving and there is the perfect opportunity to fill (or add a few more players) in that open slot. <br/><br/>My game in a sentence: The players attempt to master their arcane powers as they study at the Earthlight Academy, the only formally recognized Wizard School in all of Sadinmorrow.<br/><br/>My game in a few paragraphs: Anton, a noble who has given up his heir-dom to pursue arcane mastery, Meurig, a Squire who believes his gifts are a result of his devotion to God, and Cobb, an ex-slave whose powers awoke when his master died have all been invited to attend The Earthlight Academy. During their first semester they have learned the basics of Alchemy, mastered debate, and learned a little of the Academy's mysterious past. Cobb also conquered illiteracy, though he can't yet write. <br/><br/>During the many hours of research they have learned of the dark roots of the Academy's founding. At the outset, there were 7 schools of magic: Sorcery, Enchanting, Alchemy, Summoning, Spirit Binding, Necromancy, and Blood Magic. While the first six are still studied in some capacity, Blood Magic has been completely removed from the curriculum. Intrigued by this, they dug deeper. One of the three founding members disappears from the records completely. In many cases, pages from the books have been removed, ink smeared or crossed out. <br/><br/>Determined to uncover what happened, they begin exploring the grounds of the Earthlight Academy looking for its past. They decide to break into the library, convinced that some of the more secure areas that have been barred off from first years will shed more light. They find a cloaked, skeletal figure skulking in the stacks and the Squire decides to go steel-to-steel with it before collapsing under the weight of his wounds. The headmaster, followed by a cadre of Sentries come to their rescue and banish this creature. <br/><br/>They are subsequently placed on academic probation, but that only deters them so much. They investigate the local cemetery, taking note of the various shrines dedicated to the founders of each school of magic. As expected, they can find no such shrine for the Blood Mages. After exploring Fyndel Forest, the surrounding area of the Academy, they locate a makeshift tomb to what they believe is the lost Blood Mage. As they pry open the doors, another skeletal creature emerges and unleashes a breath of fire that nearly kills the entire group. The squire manages to lay him low with his sword, but now they must decide whether or not to return to the Academy and lick their wounds or plunge deeper into the tomb. . .<br/><br/>Post or PM if you're interested.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
