Here's the Quickstart rules (with Street Shaman on page 28): <a href="http://cdn.shadowruntabletop.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/E-CAT27QSR_SR5-Quick-Start-Rules.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://cdn.shadowruntabletop.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/E-CAT27QSR_SR5-Quick-Start-Rules.pdf</a><br/><br/>So, in the history of Shadowrun, the Native American entities ( <a href="http://shadowrun.wikia.com/wiki/Native_American_Nations" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://shadowrun.wikia.com/wiki/Native_American_Nations</a> ) are capital-P Powerful with the return of magic in the world. They're not just "setting gimmies", they're a prominent piece of the background of the game. Friends have read the Shadowrun novels and commented that NA characters are powerful, not as problematic as one might think.<br/><br/>Thing is, there was a convo on G+ where some of us were reflecting on play experiences with Shadowrun, and how NA characters might be in the party, but all the NA Nations stuff (that reflects their awesome-ness) happens mostly offscreen.<br/><br/>A setting conceit, perhaps: Since most of the game is focused on the urban-cyberpunk-gritty-action-and-magic setting of the Seattle sprawls, there's not much "in" for characters to travel to those places or do anything there, save:<br/>* Getting permission to travel through NA lands to get from Seattle to Somewhere Else.<br/>* The Street Shaman side-quest into NA lands to get some powerful magical mcguffin or powerup.<br/><br/>...just as the Dragon features into Seattle politics, but you won't interact with him unless you, like, have half your party run for local government office. Which would be a cool "awesome-ified" campaign thread for Shadowrun, IMO.<br/><br/>So, I'm wondering, what are some ways to respectfully bring the Native American Nations into a more prominent spotlight into a Shadowrun game (even if it's just a single adventure or small campaign side-arc), while still keeping a Shadowrun feel? To have some of the conceit of the setting of "NA tribes have power again; they are powerful, a force to be respected and reconed with, and now YOU have to deal with them" actually be on-screen rather than relegated to the lonely fun of novels and setting fluff?<br/><br/>Looking for adventure seeds, campaign ideas, etc.<br/><br/>Bonus points for ways to interact with the "Native American Nations" (there are eight in the union) while making each one distinctive, and not all of them the same.<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418139">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418139/#Comment_418139" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-11T11:14:26+00:00" title="July 11, 2013 11:14AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Would it maybe be valuable to take a look at race and culture in games like How We Came to Live Here and Dog Eat Dog?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418140/#Comment_418140" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-11T11:17:56+00:00" title="July 11, 2013 11:17AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Absolutely!<br/><br/>...but say we're already familiar with those games, or NA cultures (most of my knowledge comes from NE American tribes, admittedly, having grown up in NJ)... how do we bring them up in Shadowrun other than simply the introduction of an NA party member for Shaman/Magic support? <br/><br/>In other words, once we look at Dog Eat Dog, and say "You know, there's something in here that I'd like to bring prominently into a Shadowrun adventure/campaign", what does that look like?<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418142/#Comment_418142" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-11T11:54:35+00:00" title="July 11, 2013 11:54AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 11, 2013 11:55AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When you've got something called the "trans-polar Aleut nation" you've already lost the plot.

You are starting from a bad place.<br/><br/>So I would throw all of it out and start from first principles. It's speculative fiction, awesomeify the initial speculation. My guess would be that if all the Dene-speaking people were suddenly granted supernatural powers, they would do pretty much what all the Han-speaking people would do, or all the English-speaking people would do.  You might take a look at how the natives of Alaska behaved after the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, when they came suddenly into great financial and political power (Hint: They set up businesses and invested their money).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418151">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418151/#Comment_418151" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-11T14:04:16+00:00" title="July 11, 2013  2:04PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 11, 2013 2:04PM by RobMcDiarmid.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I remember correctly, the NAN folks in the setting do the "get back to nature, reject tech" thing, right? (Maybe I'm remembering wrong, but that's what I remember and I don't have my books handy to confirm.)<br/><br/>So what if you introduce a prominent Seattle street gang full of Native American youth that didn't want to do the whole back to nature thing? The Port Madison Indian Reservation (<a href="http://www.suquamish.nsn.us/Contact.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.suquamish.nsn.us/Contact.aspx</a>) is right opposite Puget Sound from downtown. Maybe some of the traditionalist elders left for the consolidated NAN territories to the east, but many of the youth stayed behind and formed a powerful street gang with a solid combination of street samurai, deckers, and shamen to give them plenty of cred.<br/><br/>Make their territory be right where the players are, and they'll bump into them plenty.<br/><br/>The key, of course, is to do some real research. But because these are punk kids who are the ones that DIDN'T choose to leave to the NAN, your research doesn't have to be super extensive.<br/><br/>-----<br/><br/>Jason, you're right that there is a lot of problematic content in Shadowrun in general. But if you really scrubbed it for problematic stuff, you'd have to do so much you'd render most of the books unusable, don't you think?<br/><br/>The whole "magic returns and Native Americans have more, or at least a different flavor, of it" thing was done in Deadlands too.<br/><br/>It's not perfect - it's arguably patronizing - but I think it's at least trying to use the big world change fiat as a way to help empower some of the most disempowered people in this country. A way to offer an alternate world where they get some comeuppance. And it's an interesting way to incorporate some real history stuff, like the Ghost Dance movement, and get people to read about things they might not otherwise be exposed to. I know Deadlands was the first reason I started reading more about Native American history.<br/><br/>Certainly it's better than the Seventh Sea approach, where the nobles, in addition to their wealth and social power, also get all the magic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418154">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418154/#Comment_418154" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-11T14:26:35+00:00" title="July 11, 2013  2:26PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with what Jason is saying.<br/><br/>This setting conceit is exotifying, othering, and advances the "single story" of first nations people that has long fit into their oppression (that natives are backwards backwoods mystics).<br/><br/>How do you awesome-ify native characters and identities in Shadowrun? I think you start by acknowledging the fact that different peoples have entirely different histories and identities and traditional strengths. The Algonquin and Salish and Cherokee are different peoples with different histories and their modern representatives are individuals.<br/><br/>I think the way you awesome-ify the native content in Shadowrun is:<br/>"Hey, are any of you going to play Native American characters? I'd love to explore themes of decolonization in this game."<br/>"Cool, so you're native? What nation? How closely tied to your heritage are you?"<br/>"So, you belong to an oppressed minority group, yeah? How does that influence your shadowrunning life?"<br/>"I'm excited about this campaign. I'm probably going to need to do some background reading on [nation] before next session!"<br/>"Are any of your family members shadowrunners?"<br/>"What's the relationship between your band council and the dominant corporations in the area?"<br/><br/>If the introduction of "racial skills" is important to you (blah), consider modern contexts. A widespread reality for native people is contending with poverty, joblessness, and disenfranchisement. The specifics vary between the reservation, the inner city, and every context between... but poverty, joblessness and disenfranchisement are frequent in all of those settings. What skills and capabilities emerge in response to those contexts? If you <i>must</i> have powers (magic or otherwise) derived from race and ethnicity, it seems like this is what those powers should be based on: resistance, resourcefulness, survival, adaptation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418155/#Comment_418155" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-11T14:28:07+00:00" title="July 11, 2013  2:28PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a question: Do any of the people who play Shadowrun ever actually go out and learn about the real-life Tsimshian or Coast Salish people?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418156/#Comment_418156" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-11T15:14:02+00:00" title="July 11, 2013  3:14PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy: How would you treat the Ainu or other indigenous peoples in a game about cyberpunk Japan?

Even if that means digging in and completely rephrasing their existence in the setting.<br/>(I actually started doing this, to some degree, with L5R...)<br/><br/>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/><br/>Interestingly enough, there was an attempt to do this in Japan, with the Tokyo Sourcebook from 1996 (it amounted to treating the Ainu like the NAN of the US books: They're powerful, they are a united people again, and are doing important stuff... off screen, Way Over There):<br/><a href="http://shadowrun.wikia.com/wiki/Timeline_of_the_JIS" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://shadowrun.wikia.com/wiki/Timeline_of_the_JIS</a><br/>A review here that kinda skewers it:<br/><a href="http://www.venus.dti.ne.jp/jmuto/sr-old/tokyo_r.html.en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.venus.dti.ne.jp/jmuto/sr-old/tokyo_r.html.en</a><br/><br/>...so, I heard some insider info from folks involved in its production. To go further, you have to know a little bit about the Burakumin:<br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burakumin" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burakumin</a><br/>These were the historic "untouchables", existing and publicly shunned officially up to the early 1900s. In 1922, there was a movement that finally ended official prejudice against them. From that point in, it's basically effectively illegal to know anything about them: You can't write down where the "burakunin slums" are in books, you can't talk about them in writing except under special circumstances, and of course cannot publicly take any actions against them that appears to be prejudicial. <br/><br/>...and yet, even now, everyone knows where the burakumin "used to live" (read "still live"). Maybe not slums, but still "places that people in the know do not choose to live, places that people in the know would not choose a husband/wife from". From large cities like Tokyo, to the little towns where I lived of 20,000 people, people who have lived there for a generation will not talk about those areas in public, and will not admit that they know anything about them... but they know about them. I've got more stories about personal interaction with people in talking about the burakumin... but not here.<br/><br/>So, again, where they live, etc: All erased from history books. Illegal to talk about or write about. On one hand, a coverup; on the other hand, an attempt to ensure that, over time (longer time than anticipated, perhaps), the knowledge of Whose Ancestors Were Burakumin will eventually fade.<br/><br/>So, back to the Tokyo Sourcebook: Group SNE's attempt to basically make a "Seattle Guide/London Guide/etc", focusing on Tokyo, writing a "Japanese sourcebook for Japanese people". Japanese Shadowrun fans were more-or-less either bemused ("cute") or ticked off ("Japanese Onmyoji are totally overpowered!!" etc), it was a more or less "meh" release.<br/><br/>But there was one shocking thing that happened, that no one talked about in public for years: <br/><br/>The writers of the Tokyo sourcebook all live/work in Kobe (west of Kyoto/Osaka, far away from Tokyo). Surprising that they didn't go all "Kansai Pride" and make a Kyoto/Osaka Sourcebook, but whatever.<br/><br/>Anyway, the one of the ways that Shadowrun deals with issues like racism, but dresses them up so that people don't feel to bad about them, is to apply racism to the fantasy metahumans in the setting. Seattle (as all cities in the setting) have "Metahuman Slums". The Seattle sourcebook details where the metahuman slums are, the London sourcebook details where the metahuman slums are, etc. So the writers of the book, using the other books as a template, said "Well, we gotta put metahuman slums in here. Where do we put them?"<br/><br/>Japanese people wince when talking about what happened next.<br/><br/>They drew out the metahuman slums on a map. Really didn't talk about them any more than the other sourcebooks did. They just near-randomly picked three places on a map of Tokyo: "Elves and Orcs and other metahumans live HERE... THERE... and... um... OTHER THERE." They probably picked places with reputations of being generally crowded or low in rent, but that's all they were going on. There's no way they could have known, as there are no maps that told you where they were, but...<br/><br/>...the metahuman slums of Tokyo, that they chose more-or-less at random, were exactly in the places where the real, human, burakumin slums were. <br/><br/>The book was reviewed for publishing, no one noticed, the book was printed and distributed. When they got to that page of the Tokyo sourcebook, all of the folks in Tokyo who had lived there for a generation Knew. And they swallowed hard, said something to the effect of "Whaaaaat thaaaaaa fuuuuuuu....?"<br/><br/>...but they couldn't admit that they knew. It was more-or-less illegal to know, to say anything about it.<br/><br/>Everyone was sweating hard for a few months after that book came out: In the mid 90s, there were a few "media bashing" events involving RPGs: The Media got wind of some RPG that sounded too brutal, or contained a demi-racist word, there was some media report/news report on it, the publishers freaked out and cancelled game lines, or shut down their RPG branches. Apparently it happened a few times. If it got out that this happened, the media would have created a report saying that it wasn't a coincidence but intentional, it would have been big news, and likely that would have been the end of Shadowrun (or other RPG imports) for Japan in the 90s. But it didn't happened: No one squealed (perhaps too embarrassed to?).<br/><br/>In any case, it wasn't until like a decade later that the original authors heard about what they accidentally did, and they were *mortified*. Like, "I want to buy all the rest of the copies that might be out there and burn them from embarrassment". But in the end, everyone had to hand-waive it off as a side-effect of the knowledge purge: There was no way they could have known, there was no way that anyone who Did know could have told them, and so on.<br/><br/>Anyway, an interesting cultural thing that happened.<br/><br/>-----<br/><br/>The burakumin/(e**) do not show up in any Japanese-made Shadowrun materials. They. Just. Don't. It's too taboo (also, illegal) to nod to them, to "awesome-ify" them in any sense... in Japan, anyway. I can still think of ways to do it carefully, making it "roleplayable" at the same time respecting their history. But coming up with something from scratch would be easier than seeing something handled a little carelessly, and reframing it to not only treat the material carefully, but to also keep at least some of the trappings of the original...<br/><br/>...hence this thread!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418167/#Comment_418167" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-11T17:36:31+00:00" title="July 11, 2013  5:36PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't played Shadowrun outside of two con games 20 years apart, so I don't know any details here or comment on looking up real-life Tsimshian people.  (I have looked up real-life cultures for other games like my Vinland RuneQuest campaign.)  From what I read of Shadowrun history, megacorps started taking power from governments, and used the power to do lots of unscrupulous things - including taking over native lands.  This triggered unrest among Indians, and as the magic awoke - among other apocalyptic events like dragons - a few newly-created shamans took the offensive and took over large swaths of the former U.S.  <br/><br/>I'd agree that there is plenty of room for criticism in the handling, but in particular I want to be careful of judging this more harshly than the more typical approach of not having any American Indians at all.  As I recall, Torg had numerous themed domains that reflect the historical culture of the region, while North America has dinosaurs and lizard men.  Along similar lines, Sons of Liberty has no Indians that I can recall.  Too often, it seems like the way to avoid being seen as racist or imperialist is to only have whites in your game.  <br/><br/>I found downloads of the Native American Nations sourcebooks - I'll give them a look and see if I have any useful comments.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nameless" title="Nameless"><img alt="Nameless" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nameless">Nameless</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418173/#Comment_418173" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-11T20:16:16+00:00" title="July 11, 2013  8:16PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Funny thing about this subject. It's complicated, or simple if you want it to be. <br/><br/>I am Native. I grew up on a reservation in the Northwest. I have lived in and around Seattle for most of my life, only recently moving away. My culture and spiritualism is very important to me, I teach my children traditional crafts and culture, and I studied Traditional Healing with a Makah Native, a Colville Native, and a Yakima Native traditional healers during medical school. <br/><br/>I grew up playing Shadowrun, starting with 1st edition. The majority of my friends were Native in high school, and we all played Native characters the majority of the time. We introduced cultural iconography and some very basic stereotyped cultural themes. We generally avoided anything that came close to real life Native spirituality. We didn't touch it because you don't play with that stuff, it can get you in trouble. Not just with the PC police, but because Native spirituality can be dangerous. Look up sweat lodges and you will find fatalities in those who don't know what they are doing. We knew that it was dangerous physically, and that doesn't even count the things that we couldn't understand, couldn't explain, and that scared the shit out of us at night. We just played future dudes with guns and spells and feathers who spoke to animal spirits, and occasionally went on vision quests. We quoted Dances With Wolves. We kicked ass on corporate thugs and Despoilers of the Environment. We handed racists their asses in bloody buckets. The most important part of the game was our gear. The closest we got to really real world shit was naming our tribe, which usually coincided with our own. <br/><br/>When you get into the reality of Native history and culture, it is hard to play with it respectfully while getting real. The various cultures are hard to get from the outside. I only know this because of the way most people don't get me, why I do things, and where I am coming from. Sharing Native culture is certainly OK, but on the whole, Native people do not share the really deep stuff easily, and it is usually through observation and not discourse or writing that you will really get at the important things to Natives. If you read about Natives, just understand that you really are just getting the proverbial tip of the iceberg, and most likely from a white guy's perspective. In that light, getting at cool is a more realistic goal than getting at "real".<br/><br/>I would say that playing a stereotyped Native is fine, as long as you understand that this is what you are doing. Understand the history of oppression, and understand the extreme privilege you may be coming from to even think about how to "Awesome-ify" Natives in Shadowrun. No slam from me about that, it is just a fact, and it is OK as long as you recognize it.<br/><br/>If you want to apply a few principles to do it "right" from my perspective, try these.<br/><br/>1. Animism - Every natural element has a spirit, and each is your brother. Read Native legends to help with this.<br/>2. Family is everything - When there are approximately 4 last names on a reservation, you may be related to everyone.<br/>3. Natives have been poor, but given an advantage, they recover fast. See Casinos. <br/>4. Try mixing the most ancient skills with the most modern in each character. A decker/artist and whale hunter would be cool. I am a doctor, I perform robotic assisted pelvic surgery, and in my off time, I bead, sweat, and dance at pow wows.<br/>5. Every Native kid is good at basketball, despite the fact that almost no-one is over 6 feet tall. Kinda like short black kids.<br/>6. Most Natives are incognito - With 600 years of European contact, many Natives have white skin, most can easily exist in the modern world, and for many, native iconography doesn't have to be front and center for their personal image or style. See the backlash against hipster head dresses and feathers for an example of how Native iconography has appropriate and inappropriate places.<br/>7. Watch Smoke Signals, and read everything that Sherman Alexie has written.<br/><br/>Anyway, not sure that you need to "Awesome-ify" Natives in Shadowrun. Treat them as the powerful groups and individuals that they are, and play with them as you see fit. Do it with good intentions, recognize that you will do it "wrong", and have fun. When Natives play Shadowrun, we don't take it too seriously, we make good fun of stereotypes, and we mostly just do the normal Shadowrun type stuff, like shoot bad guys and steal their info for money.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418189/#Comment_418189" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-12T05:33:10+00:00" title="July 12, 2013  5:33AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 12, 2013 5:36AM by Johnstone.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's the thing. Or <i>one</i> thing really, but it's kind-of serious. First Nations communities here in British Columbia, including the Tsimshian and Salish, are on the shitty end of an unequal power dynamic in their relations with various levels of white government. When they have to deal with those governments over (for example) land claims issues, if there are any misconceptions held by the government people, about the cultures of individual nations, <i>those nations</i> are the ones who suffer for it. And not just as individuals either, but as communities. And how are these communities supposed to inform non-Native people about their individual cultures? There are probably about as many Tsimshian in the world as there are Shadowrun players -- their voice is pretty quiet. It's getting easier now what with the invention of websites and podcasts, but there's still that weight of stereotype and confusion over different First Nations cultures to contend with, and anything that contributes to that can actually end up exacerbating the inequality in those power relations, in addition to just being insulting to individuals.<br/><br/>So that's something to consider at least. I say it's "kind-of" serious because it's not like playing a game with your pals equals the destrction of someone's culture or anything. But avoiding racism with regards to First Nations (and other aboriginal people) isn't <i>just</i> about <i>negative</i> portrayals. Even positive portrayals of Natives can get in the way of inter-cultural dealings at the political level. Not that many people in government play rpgs, I don't think.<br/><br/>Also I bring those two up specifically because they're Canadian First Nations, so including them in a thing called the "Native American Nations" is rather less-acceptable than it was 20 years ago. Not a big deal if you take Nameless' advice and accept that your fiction is "wrong" and just for fun, but it's also a good idea to not take the easy route of lumping a bunch of different peoples together under one label.<br/><br/>(Also also: So it's magical First Natelves running shit all over this joint BUT BUT BUT the city where the game takes place is still run by white people.

Natives are seriously diverse (we're talking 2 continents here, just talking about the American Natives), and there are some serious consequences to both the oppression (ongoing), and the cultural appropriation (ongoing). This is no small subject, and a game would be really hard pressed to adequately address it. With that in mind, I like Shadowrun well enough, and I just choose to ignore the fact that there are serious problems with the portrayal of Natives in Shadowrun. Not sure I have the energy to solve it.<br/><br/>I think to get at your point Johnstone, we could add a couple more principles to my list:<br/><br/>8. Native people are diverse, and Native peoples are diverse - Lets not make entire continents of entire nations of people homogenous Sparkly Magical Natives.<br/>9. Native people have personal problems too - Ditch the Noble Savage, or at least use it only as seasoning to contrast from the more real characters. I have a really good friend that is in prison for being a shitbag and stealing from his own community. We can talk about the weight of oppression, role fulfillment for men of color, etc..., but bottom line is that most Natives are not even close to the Noble Savage of stereotype, make them real, make them human.<br/>10. Many Native people will use the Noble Savage stereotype as a tool to help themselves - Normal people can make a lot of a romanticized honorable image, even if they are shitbags. The bigger the difference between themselves and the stereotyped Noble Savage, the more appeals to this stereotype they will make, and the more Native iconography they will sport. Small cues to make people fall into tired tropes can go a long way.<br/>11. Given some power, Native people will probably act like white people - Money will be invested, people will become less important, those with less power will be oppressed, and those with more will become corrupt. People will die for money, and influence will not stop at borders.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418197/#Comment_418197" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-12T06:54:45+00:00" title="July 12, 2013  6:54AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I grew up playing Shadowrun, starting with 1st edition.

Maybe that's just how I'm reading it in the bits of setting info I've gathered. <br/><br/>My feeling is to want to incorporate Native Americans into the main cities (Seattle) and settings more, as well as un-magic-ify them, while highlighting the ideals of family and tradition you're talking about.

Seattle was special as an exclave, maybe to create a contained setting where it was hard to leave the city. But Las Vegas and parts of Denver (which is a sector town) were cities early in the run of the game that got descriptions and are in the native nations in the game. They were not very different from other cities, just a few names of people being clichee native.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan" title="Jonathan"><img alt="Jonathan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan">Jonathan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418212/#Comment_418212" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-12T07:53:43+00:00" title="July 12, 2013  7:53AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Yeah, it's huge and complicated!

The Algonquin aren't often pleased about sharing space with the Cree and the Ojibway (who frequently call themselves the Anishanabe). <br/><br/>Shadowrun most of the NAN stuff I've read in Shadowrun has basically gone on to say, "Well, there's this nation ... and their biggest problem is that they don't have enough people for all the land they have."

Really interesting is the part describing the split personality of the recently-merged PCC and Ute sector. It's likely inaccurate to the real life cultures, but it does show that there are a lot of ways to be Native American in the 2070s.<br/><br/>I recently ran an adventure set in Denver, and while the plot wasn't directly related to Native American power, it easily could have been, just using the material from that book. The players did quite a bit of interesting stuff with Native American characters and politics in any case.
