On to the future!  And what's next on the horizon?  Dexcon 15, scheduled for July 4-8.<br/><br/>I understand that Dexcon is different from Dreamation somehow, though I have no clear indication of what those differences are.  Looking at last year's site it seems to be a gaming convention with war games and board games and roleplaying games, which seems to be exactly the same.  It's one day longer, I guess?<br/><br/>Anyway, I wondered who's planning on going and what they plan on doing when they get there.  I'm also trying to decide if I should make the trip or just wait until next year's Dreamation.<br/><br/>If I do go, <i>this</i> time will not be like last time.  That much I know for sure.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King" title="Double King"><img alt="Double King" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King">Double King</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363491/#Comment_363491" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T13:59:06+00:00" title="February 28, 2012  1:59PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dexcon traditionally was the lynchpin convention and Dreamation was the satellite convention.  Dreamation used to be a big early-in-the-year launching pad for new indie games (less so the past few years.)  There is some difference between the two.  Dexcon is definitely more robust on the non-indie side.  However you would recognize about 70-80% of the same indie rpg folk.  some like it better/not so much.  <br/><br/>Considering your positive reaction from a tiny slice of Dreamation; i would whole heartedly endorse you trying Dexcon out.<br/><br/>ps. Vinnie sent out an announcement that he's going to reinvest into Dexcon this year so there will likely be some changes and ... ?  anyway.  check it out!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_363789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363789/#Comment_363789" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-29T08:01:12+00:00" title="February 29, 2012  8:01AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chances are we'll be there.

For the past four or five years there have been a number of games that have used Dreamation as a starting point.  The point of that was that it was <i>less so</i> this year... and probably last year.<br/><br/>Nothing to see here.
