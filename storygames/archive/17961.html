These will be NPCs that are interesting to me and will hopefully create conflict. <br/>The NPCs i am sure to include are a girl from a strict muslimic household that is a bit mousey but really nice (and hot) and a guy that everyone just "knows" he is gay (is he?). <br/><br/>I will label 1 table in the classroom the "nerd table" and ask the players who sits there. When characters are introduced i will ask where everyone sits and who sit's next to them. Maybe ask PC 1 why NPC X that was his friend now allways sits with PC 2. <br/><br/>Make them to their stuff and interact around and then introduce two parties. A school party to celebrate the new year and a party over at the hot/rich sisters. Of course NPCs will want to pull the PCs to both parties and we will see what they actually want. <br/><br/>Does this seem enough Prep for a One-Shot?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Praion" title="Praion"><img alt="Praion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Praion">Praion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406118/#Comment_406118" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-13T07:41:05+00:00" title="February 13, 2013  7:41AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, i allowed the Selkie and the Serpentine but banned the Choosen.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406120">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406120/#Comment_406120" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-13T07:58:06+00:00" title="February 13, 2013  7:58AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I created a central event that just happened with new questions for the characters based on it (basically, retooling Joe's Blood of Misty Harbor setting characters).

It came with pre-built PC's though. That's one way to do it, although I let me players make their characters because I think that's one of the most fun parts of this game.<br/><br/>I think your plan is pretty solid. Have an idea of a plot that's basically just there for the PC's to fumble around with. The plot is not really where the fun of a Monsterhearts game is, it's just the red herring for the players to get into messy situations and the drama basically plays itself out from there. The most fun for players in a MOnsterhearts game is playing their characters and gaining XP by making messy situations for themselves, so basically just give them the tools to do that by creating easily overcome opposition, and NPCs and situations that poke at the characters' fundamental issues.<br/><br/>So, for example, if you have a Serpentine in play, make sure one of the NPCs is messing with his family. If you have a Ghost, make sure you have someone who really makes her feel invisible. If you have a Werewolf, make sure you can trigger their rage. Then point it at a PC. <br/><br/>Always frame a scene with at least 3PC's in it, if not all of them at once.<br/><br/>Go with the flow of what the players want, and less what your plot demands. Change plot as necessary.<br/><br/>Set up difficult and painful choices. Players love that emo shit.<br/><br/>Don't forget the horror! Take some of your favorite TV horror tropes and throw them in there. Make it bloody and gory, and do it suddenly in between the romance and high school drama. Or do something really creepy. Some of the best ways to do horror is subtly, the scariest things are the things not fully on screen.<br/><br/>Let the players make their characters, and adjust you pre-written ideas a little as needed. <br/><br/>After the characters are made and you go around the table describing each one, ask them provocative questions based on their description, background, and skin.<br/>"So you live in a trailer park. How did you feel when you brought your first boyfriend home to meet your parents?" If you can, ask leading questions involving some kind of past romantic or twisted relationship. I've found this really grounds players in their characters and in the themes of the game right away.<br/><br/>Probably overkill on my advice here, but I hope this is helpful to you!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406313/#Comment_406313" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-15T10:19:07+00:00" title="February 15, 2013 10:19AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Don't forget the horror!

(a total worthless job here in germany - don't know if it is better in the UK) This is a perfect point for powergames and class politic to come into play. <br/>The meek girl trying to talk up the A+ student because she fears all the other choices are a really bad idea and talking him up into a rage. Of course there must be more to his story then just the immense pressure of his parents, we don't know what yet what it is. <br/><br/>Who suffers from his wrath? The transsex boy/gir (i was picturing Claire from Questionable Content) l that is totally unsure about herself and of course sees it as a direct attack against her because she is different. She breaks down and cries. <br/><br/>The mousy muslim girl notches the ghoul of all people to help her BECAUSE IT MAKES HER LOOK GOOD for the vote the next day. <br/>The ghoul, beeing a good person suppresses her hunger and actually turns the situation sexual and Marcy/Marcel can't control herself and kisses the morrigan. (Marcel is actually in love with Merril whos failed move started the whole event)<br/><br/>I found this to be a perfect Monsterhearts Moment from a Teen-Drama perspective. Not enough Horror there but oohh the Drama<br/><br/>I also kind of wanted to include a transsex character but was unsure about how to do it. This actually came into play naturally because we wheren't sure whether Marcy was a Boy or a Girl. We then decided for both and i was really really happy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406928/#Comment_406928" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-22T07:39:03+00:00" title="February 22, 2013  7:39AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow!

It sounds like the NPC ideas you had really brought out interesting reactions from the players. <br/><br/>Having Marcel kiss the PC was a fantastic move on your part!<br/><br/>Having gone through the process, do you want to tell us what parts of your MC prep seemed most useful, and which ones not so much? Were there any stumbling points for you during this first session? Things that didn't go so smoothly.<br/><br/>Also, I don't know if I'm imagining this, but I saw in the blog writeup that Lucian's player was playing an RPG for the first time. That's always exciting. However, both your writeup and your friend's hardly mention Lucian at all. Did the new player get to participate meaningfully in the game? I certainly hope so. (But some new players can be very shy, too, so it's not necessarily anyone's fault, even if it is the case.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Praion" title="Praion"><img alt="Praion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Praion">Praion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407067/#Comment_407067" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-24T01:45:37+00:00" title="February 24, 2013  1:45AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I used this Guide <br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5bS9J1O4w-4TWhZZXVONUF6TTA/edit" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5bS9J1O4w-4TWhZZXVONUF6TTA/edit</a> <br/><br/>but didn't use that many questions from it in the end. The Serpentine and Ghoul questions are really good though. <br/><br/>We spend a lot of time in setting things up and creating characters. We needed at least an hour before filling the homeroom und then 1 player had a longer disconect. This on the other hand allowed us to invite the witch into the game that created her character really fast and fitted good in the classroom. <br/>Lucien actually didn't do that much. He got a call from his father to run for class-president. He lost some influence on his lackey Thomas but didn't do something about it. I maybe should have promted the player to roll a move at one moment. <br/>Lucien than tried to get into the conversation between Merril and Grahame but was instantly shut down. I may have given him something more to do there but the scene was really good the way it went. <br/>He will have the first scene of the next game for sure. <br/>The player of Lucien  still had fun from what i heard but also was a bit confused and unsure about what to do. I know her personally and she is a bit slow sometimes. She is creative and draws but sometimes she takes a bit to get going. <br/>We will se what works and what doesn't. <br/><br/>What really helped everyone where the questions i asked after the introduction of the characters. I asked the Ghoul how long she was dead (1 day) and how her parents dealt with it (they didn't care). They want her to be perfect like her brother but she doesn't care and does her own thing. <br/><br/>I asked everyone where they lived (Mattieu lives in a holiday house at the beach that stands empty. FOR NOW.) <br/>I can'T remember what else i asked right now. <br/><br/>I didn't really have time to ask these things about the witch and this will be the first thing i will do next session. <br/><br/>I set a classroom google doc up beforehand and set in 3 names and labeled 1 bench as the "nerd bench" and asked the PCs who of them sits there. It was the Morrigan who is a Ex-Nerd. She completly bannend this part of her over the holiday. Not fitting for her new un-life. I also gave her MArcel and Meral to protect (she took the watchfull golem move. They both are full of fear too so this will be interesting)<br/><br/><br/>Next session i will have the aftermath of the kiss. Merril and Mattieu in detention (giving Merril a chance to hex people and get some tokens maybe). Morrigan and Lucien will get a scene after school where they can do stuff and then we will have the party. I will ask every PC what their plan is for the party - what they really want from it just to help them focus a bit. Then, depending on the time we will go to the next day and the vote for class president.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Praion" title="Praion"><img alt="Praion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Praion">Praion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408237/#Comment_408237" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-06T04:37:02+00:00" title="March  6, 2013  4:37AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Session 2 (a player wrote the report down again)<br/><a href="http://wingsfate.blogspot.de/2013/03/monsterhearts-cardiff-wales-episode-2.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://wingsfate.blogspot.de/2013/03/monsterhearts-cardiff-wales-episode-2.html</a> <br/><br/>Further discussion of this game will continue here: <br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18048/mhselkie-sex-and-voting-for-class-president" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18048/mhselkie-sex-and-voting-for-class-president</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
