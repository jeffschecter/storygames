Memories, dreams, books, paintings\u2014all of these<br/>\nmay mix together. To help you distinguish fact from fiction, we have prepared<br/>\nthis guide to the world you live in. You may treat the following statements<br/>\nabout the world as true:<br/>\n-You are a supernatural being currently bound in Human Form. Somehow a group, individual or event has hidden your true nature not only from others but from yourself, you don't remember it but you are some manner of angel, spirit, demon or otherworldly entity currently restricted to a human body.<br/>\n-It is the Twenty-First Century. That is not to say that you haven't possibly live for a significant amount of time compared to most humans, you may indeed have existed for many millenia, however if you have memories of super advanced technology or strange and sinister alien devices they are likely not of human origin.<br/>\n- To Most people the world is a mundane place. People see wonders and terrors from simple and personal things, like the birth of a child or the death of a loved one. But to a lucky few there are wonders and terrors in this world that are beyond mortal imagination, gods, angels, demons, spirit, faeries and all many of other supernatural creatures roamthe world and the spaces between worlds. If you have memories of magic, supernatural beings or otherworldly landscapes, do not immediately dismiss them as fantasy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_223445">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223445/#Comment_223445" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-08T13:22:14+00:00" title="August  8, 2009  1:22PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just wanted to report here the suggestion Paul himself dropped on Narrative Control: a "narrower" Facts and Reassurances dealing with normal people, but all with a more precise setting.<br/><br/>For example: "What happened in Vegas?".

AP. John, Kathy and I played The Shadow Out Of Memory. Relevant facts:\n<ul><li>Both of them have played CoC with me before, and I knew buy-in for a horror game would be high</li>\n<li>We've played a few satisfying sessions of <i>Fiasco</i>, so we were confident about GMlessness</li>\n<li>We had, just minutes before, completed a playtest of my new GM-less game, without issues</li>\n<li>We prefer tight narrative constraints, which help to avoid deer-in-the-headlights situations</li>\n<li>All of us enjoy (sorry, need to say it) Story Now play when appropriate</li></ul>The learn-as-you-go, zero-prep rules structure where the Reader teaches the rules in play was completely awesome. Everyone understood what was going on right away, as soon as we had finished the first question and answer. Paul totally hit that out of the park! <br/><br/>Although it didn't come up in our game, we did note with approval the ingenious mechanism to bail out players who are having trouble contributing: if you get lapped because you're not getting coins, then when the other players "I will help you remember" you, they give you additional narrative constraint, helping you get started on more solid footing. Brilliant! Speaking of which, we loved the ritual phrases, which clearly call attention to the places where you need to interact while simultaneously reinforcing the framing device. In particular, we used "Are you sure?" a few times at the beginning to reach agreement on the pacing of the stories and the bounds we'd use for what decisions required input; that was also cool, like using an accented downbeat in music jamming to get everyone back onto the same page if they start wandering. As a final technique note, I'd like to point out that if three people play, then everyone is involved in every game-mechanical action, which might be ideal. We thrived on the constant collaboration.<br/><br/>As to ephemera: to save space at the table, we put the memory trigger slips into the same bowl as the pennies. We cut up pages from a pocket notebook into thirds, which was the perfect size for triggers.<br/><br/>Drift: As it turned out, we had a couple of pairs of nearly identical memory triggers. We laughed, said "The drug works!" most emphatically, and decided to draw a new slip. I suppose it would have been cool to see what our different stories did with similar triggers, too!  But seeing more triggers was fun. Also, I diked out the part in the F&amp;R document about it being the 1920s. We went present day instead, as we always do when playing CoC. This did not present any problems in play.<br/><br/>The part no one cares about but us: Our stories were of radically different tones, which was really awesome. Kathy's story involved her encounters with a sort of animate meat that infects flesh and liberates it from bodies. It was pretty nasty splatterpunk! The funny thing is that at the beginning of the game, she had asked, "How do they know to give us this F&amp;R, that mentions that we were in some Lovecraftian jam?" Answer, in her case: the suspicious amateur arm amputation! John's was a more reflective story about a man who lost his love, and was haunted by creatures of embodied loss, who had tried to initiate him into their number by effecting his girlfriend's death. Mine was more traditionally Lovecraftian \u2014 tainted blood, hereditary priesthood of a Thing That Should Not Be, pursued by a cult that wanted me to lead them (and it was a struggle for me not to give in, due to the tainted blood aforementioned).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_225289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225289/#Comment_225289" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-17T23:07:17+00:00" title="August 17, 2009 11:07PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 17, 2009 11:08PM by ccreitz.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yeah: We may well play again in a couple of days. I've been mulling over a couple of ideas.<br/><br/>One: A sort of Ramayana-inspired resetting, call it "Lost Great Souls," where you need to remember things from your past lives to understand a challenge you will face in the future. F&amp;R is that a prophecy has indicated that you are the reincarnation of a legendary hero, with a critical role to play in defeating a cosmic threat. Questions like:<br/><br/>How did you first meet the enemy who would stalk you through many births?<br/>How did your enemy defeat you utterly?<br/>How did you learn the secret that will allow you to defeat your enemy once and for all?<br/><br/>Idea the second: characters were utterly debauched rock stars, like the ahistorical Led Zeppelin of <i>Hammer Of The Gods</i>. The interesting twist: they were in the same band. This requires us to tie the stories together! F&amp;R is that they were discovered comatose and recovered into amnesia, due to some climactic act of dissipation. No one but them knows for sure what they did offstage, but rumors swirl of depraved sexual practices, heroic drug consumption, and the many perverted vices of the extremely rich and irresponsible. What really happened in those hotel rooms, buses, and green rooms?  Still working on ideas for the questionnaire. Call it "Hammered/Godlike."<br/><br/>Or we could just totally do Shadow Out Of Memory again.
