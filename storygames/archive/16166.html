Stage: emails with a graduate student assistant.  Even though the warning signs are subtle, every single seismograph in the state is sensing tectonic activity.</i><br/>Event: Soon after a series of small Earthquakes experienced throughout California over a period of a week.<br/><i>Scene: How does Dr. Nishikawa realize he may need to sound the need for an evacuation of the state?  Stage: A conversation with a fellow geologist in Japan.  During the conversation, the fellow geologist completely dismisses the need for alarm.  The Japanese scientist thinks its well within what one would expect from statistics, especially since the state has been quiet for so long.  However, as the conversation ensues, Dr. Nishikawa suddenly realizes a pattern in the map of California that ties the faults together in a way that could result in a huge chain reaction if triggered.</i><br/><br/><b>Period: People Begin to Leave California voluntarily \u2013 a series of continuous but minor tremors begin to get the population skittish.</b><br/><br/><b>Period: Mandatory Exodus.  As the Earthquakes continue and the infrastructure is broken beyond repair, the government calls for an evacuation of the entire state.</b><br/>Event: Major Earthquakes begin to rock the state regularly.<br/>Event: Squatter Camps Develop outside of Vegas.  These camps are primarily composed of people who do not have the resources to really go anywhere.  Also many of them just don\u2019t think this will last forever and they basically just get far enough away to keep the authority off their backs.<br/>Event: Anti-government, revolutionary political sentiment develops throughout the squatter camps.  Faith in the government erodes and a libertarian streak becomes very popular among the refugees.<br/>Event: The libertarians lose hope in reforming the government.  So the revolutionary zeal dissipates and instead those without faith in the government begin to migrate out of the squatter camps to form independent communities.<br/><br/><b>Period: East Coast and West Coast gets wiped out.  There\u2019s nowhere to go but the heartland.</b><br/>Event: Terrorists set off a nuclear device in Manhattan.<br/><i>Scene: Were the terrorists related to the revolutionaries in the squatter camps? Stage: An FBI investigator speaks with an anonymous phone caller from Texas.  It turns out that the Texan was a contractor working at a jobsite and heard these Mexican guys talking about something really big happening in a few days \u2013 before Manhattan blew up.  The implication is no, this terrorist attack is from a South American group, not from inside.</i><br/><br/><b>Period: Refugees flood into Nevada.  At this point California is completely fallen off the map, but with turmoil throughout the country, there is nowhere to go, especially for these people who have almost nothing.</b><br/>Event: Contaminated water supply in camps cause riots, frustration, and illness leading to death.<br/><i>Dictated Scene: What is the mood of the camps?  As more and more people succumb to radiation poising from fallout after the nuclear attack, people realize that the federal government is incapacitated from all sides.  There is no help coming and they will be stuck in the desert a long, long time.<br/></i><br/><b>Period: People fighting for limited resources.  You think things were bleak before, well it still gets worse!</b><br/>Event: In the midst of this poverty, an non-legal social structure develps.  However these gangs are particularly viscious and brutal, and people immigrate out of these camps even though there is zero government help in the wilds.<br/><br/><b>Period: A New Coastline.  Ways for making fresh water are developed allowing independent communities to develop throughout the new coastal region.</b><br/>Event: A government census discovers there are many more people in the western portion of the country than they had assumed.  The govenernment had spent its attention on the squatter camps but there was much more people living in independent communities throughout the west.  It is a chaotic social situation, but there are people out there.<br/><i>Dictated Scene: How did they solve the water problem? Along the new coastline, people had cobbled small localized desalinization plants that were being built in the midwest using innovative technologies that were introduced before the disaster.</i><br/><br/><b>Period: California Rises again!</b><br/>Event: Descendants of the squatter camps go back to repopulate the new landmass<br/><i>Scene:  What did the first settlers coming from Nevada see as they crossed the Sierra Nevadas? Stage: The leader of the settling party as they travel.  As they begin their trek it is pretty much familiar, but as they continue up through the mountains and passes they begin to see more and more strange and different plants and wildlife.  As they finally crest at the top of a pass, the look out onto the beyond.  The mountain slopes down into the ocean and far away across the water, they see a new body of land that has emerged from the water.</i><br/><br/><b>Thoughts from the newbie at this game:</b><br/>And I do mean newbie.  This is the second time that either of us has partaken in an RPG session.  For better or worse, I had great fun at the game, unfortunately my girlfriend realized that RPG\u2019s may not be her thing.  She\u2019s burned out on gaming in general and she\u2019s more into more passive activities such as watching television, surfing the internet, and watching TV on the internet.  That said she was quite a trooper for this two session extravaganza and she was open to the idea of playing this game in bite sized chunks in the future.  <br/><br/>The first session was two hours long because we ended up dropping our first Big Picture \u2013 \u201cwhat if the humans discover a parallel universe and in the end two cities swap populations\u201d.  It sounds like a really intriguing idea, but the idea of parallel universes and transporting souls back and forth and teleportation just blew our minds during the palatte phase.  So instead we started over with a much simpler premise.  Having spent a lot of time on the setup, I started with a tight focus that was maybe too tight for the beginning \u2013 especially since my girlfriend was not ready to jump around in time nearly as much as I was.  So we dropped the Oakland Raiders focus after my initial pair of Super Bowl event+ Dr. Nishikawa\u2019s ominious discovery scene.  She came up with the more general focus \u201chow did everyone get out of California\u201d, which we did an AA-B-A-B-AA series and closed out the night with my legacy, squatter camps.<br/><br/> In retrospect, we only seeded the first pass with one Period from each of us, and I don\u2019t think that was enough to our creative juices going so the aborted focus with the Oakland Raiders Event/Dr. Nishikawa Scene was essentially a \u201csecond pass\u201d.  When we play this again, I would do ABAB for the first pass for a two player game.<br/><br/>Knowing that my girlfriend was not necessarily fond of this collaborative storytelling experiment, we just ran a short session the day after, to give a little conclusion to the story and see how it would play out with a little more attention.  As such we ran two lenses, with just AA-B-AA in both of them.  Even though this structure seems like a very quick round and overly weighted towards the A player\u2019s interest, because the B player has the legacy period/event interstitial in which she can do whatever she wants, it actually balances out quite nicely.  Each round took about 30 minutes since we knew what we were doing.  <br/><br/>I think she had a harder time with the scenes, and the two scenes she initiated were both dictated scenes.  I don\u2019t know if the idea of role-playing in the first person freaked her out but once she got over the mental hurdle she seemed to get into character even though she did swap characters with me a couple times when she hit a creative roadblock mid-scene.  On the other hand, I really enjoyed the scene mechanic. I loved the uncertainty that came as part of role playing.  For example I had thrown in the terrorist attack in Manhattan event very early and ended the first session with the event concerning anti-government groups in squatter camps.  Later that night I realized I could easily connect the two events.  So in the second session one of the first things I did was to initiate the scene with the FBI investigator\u2026and it turned out be Mexicans behind it all!<br/><br/>My girlfriend was still a bit more linear in her approach \u2013 I suspect the jumping around in time was not as much to her liking, and she liked to focus on one subject and she had a hard time with the scene making.  However, this game still works nicely for that.  She was able to stay more focused keeping her interests more clumped together while I jumped around and added things here and there.  She had a hard time biting her tongue when I did something she thought was ridiculous, but after having played it through, I think she realizes the resiliency of the system now and hopefully she will have much less pressure getting it \u201cright\u201d from the beginning \u2013 which is one reason I think she did not enjoy the first session as much as the second session.  It\u2019s one thing to say \u201cjust do it, it won\u2019t break the game\u201d, it\u2019s another thing to actually go through a game and see how it all comes together.<br/><br/>And that is why I pretty sure I will love this game.  I am a fan of oulipo fiction and hard boiled detective novels.  Its an odd pairing, but this game really ties the two together in my mind.  Calvino was a writer who eschewed linear fiction and who played with structure in his books.  And while there was no hint of any such \u201cmeta\u201d discourse in the genre fiction of Chandler and Ross MacDonald, there are many twists and turn that don\u2019t make sense until after the fact.  What I find interesting in this game is the \u201cafter the fact explanation\u201d might be something that actually happens earlier in the epic history even if it is narrated later in gameplay.  It\u2019s a game that takes our human propensity to tie everything neatly and just lets us go wild \u2013it somehow avoids coming together in a predictable boring manner yet it magically avoids spinning out of control.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/aaarg_ink" title="aaarg_ink"><img alt="aaarg_ink" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.grizzlypear.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/pepper32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/aaarg_ink">aaarg_ink</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368562/#Comment_368562" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-19T21:14:32+00:00" title="March 19, 2012  9:14PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Couple extra random thoughts<br/>1) Funny how the story never really deals with the event of California falling into the sea nor how it rises up.

I was going to say "yeah, it's easiest to start off making something small" but this is Microscope so that would be absurd. Let's say it's easier to start of with something more concrete and predictable/visualizable, which is exactly what you did. Very smart.\n<blockquote>In retrospect, we only seeded the first pass with one Period from each of us, and I don\u2019t think that was enough to our creative juices going so the aborted focus with the Oakland Raiders Event/Dr. Nishikawa Scene was essentially a \u201csecond pass\u201d.  When we play this again, I would do ABAB for the first pass for a two player game.</blockquote>\nNot a bad idea. I think it's pretty reasonable in a two-player game to ask "do we have enough that one of us is ready to make a Focus or should we do a second pass?"<br/><br/>I think the game is always easier the tighter you make the Focus. It drives your history to the human level very quickly, which makes it gripping (rather than just fascinating). Your Focus can be extremely tight, like "Dr. Nishikawa faking his research data to prove his thesis." (assuming he'd do such a terrible thing)\n<blockquote>Knowing that my girlfriend was not necessarily fond of this collaborative storytelling experiment, we just ran a short session the day after, to give a little conclusion to the story and see how it would play out with a little more attention.</blockquote>\nAgain, very smart. Knowing when to quit is wise. You're already ahead of a lot of gaming veterans <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/>\n<blockquote>As such we ran two lenses, with just AA-B-AA in both of them.

If B really likes the Focus they can just use it again on their turn (AA-B-AA, legacy, BB-A-BB).\n<blockquote>I think she had a harder time with the scenes, and the two scenes she initiated were both dictated scenes.</blockquote>\nTo be fair to her and you both, jumping in and role-playing head-to-head can be pretty intense in any game. There's no one else there to carry the conversation if you need to sit back for a moment. That's hardcore, higher level gaming.\n<blockquote>My girlfriend was still a bit more linear in her approach \u2013 I suspect the jumping around in time was not as much to her liking, and she liked to focus on one subject and she had a hard time with the scene making.

She was able to stay more focused keeping her interests more clumped together while I jumped around and added things here and there.</blockquote>\nYep, you're exactly right. She gets to build on the stuff she likes. Maybe that means going in a precisely chronological order just like a normal game. That's a-okay.\n<blockquote>Funny how the story never really deals with the event of California falling into the sea nor how it rises up.  Then again the human drama is what was really interesting to us.</blockquote>\nThe awesome bit is that those lingering voids can be filled whenever you get curious about them. We've had histories where really central questions didn't get answered until several game sessions later.\n<blockquote>3) I think on rpggeek I read a forum post where Ben said a failed palette session in a way actually a successful thing.
