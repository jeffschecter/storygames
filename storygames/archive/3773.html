What I mainly said in the mentionned thread, was that people (well, at least some) <i>bring something already written to the table</i> (if they GM) for a game. It turned out it took around forty posts to explain what <i><b>I</b></i> was looking for, according to my specific needs, in that part I bring to the table (and explaining my own project that evolves around this idea).<br/><br/>So, here, I'm looking for a discussion, concerning this prewritten part, about <i>your</i> needs.<br/>For instance, here's my mine, quoted from the above thread :\n<blockquote>1. I want the PCs to have freedom, to be able to choose their own path, their own destiny.<br/>2. In this context, I want the PCs to be able to change their "center of interest" in the course of play.<br/>3. I want the PCs to be able to interfere with the plot ; change things.<br/>4. I want the PCs to be in a "living world", to get the sense it doesn't live only around them.<br/>5. I want the world to be coherent from a plotline point of view.<br/></blockquote>\nOf course, this is in the context of a campaign. So, based on those needs, I'm using a specific design that looks like this : multi plots, calendar based, relating all the events of the world, for a given time, written in a way that excludes the PCs (the prewritten part never mention them).<br/><br/>What I'm saying is that <b>plot does matter</b> ; just like systems. But not the plot itself : the way it is written, designed. Different needs bring different design. I also do believe that the prewritten part is kinda absent in indie design ; safe for exception. Dogs, for instance, uses a very powerful design for towns, that corresponds exactly to the needs of this game !! And I keep looking around and beside a couple of exceptions, I don't see much going on the subject ; not much replacing the old chapters based, linear, centered on the PCs that doesn't do what we need.<br/><br/>So, what are your needs ? What do you bring (maybe you don't bring anything, for a game of Capes, for instance) ? In what context (small game or campaign) ? Does the context changes what you bring ? Do you use a specific design ? Do you think it is a good idea to have a specific design for it ?<br/><br/>A note about this thread : I'm really looking out for a <i>discussion</i>, not a <i>poll</i> !!!

I automatically resent any "homework" a game requires me to do <i>even if I'd enjoy it, were it not required</i>. Heck, I even resent having to turn up to regular sessions of a game, but that's probably just me. I'll put a lot of effort into putting together bits and pieces for a game, but anything that smacks of the word 'mandatory' puts me off immediately. As such, it's quite hard for me to imagine myself enjoying something which required me to even read a setup like the one you describe, let alone create one.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: pells</cite>Do you use a specific design ? Do you think it is a good idea to have a specific design for it ?</blockquote>\nI'm not entirely sure what you mean by "specific design", but if you mean a defined procedure by which material is generated for use in future sessions, then yes, I think that's a great idea. Actually, I think it's a great idea whether you mean it or not.<br/><br/>However.<br/><br/>I don't see why this has to be homework. Roleplaying games are an inherently social activity, and the primary reason I play them is social. By this, I don't mean "I play because I get to hang out with my friends", but "I play because I enjoy interacting creatively with others". As such, the idea of going off on my own and making something to bring to the table seems to be at right angles to what I enjoy about roleplaying. If I enjoy making things on my own (which I do), I'll go and make something on my own. I won't make things on my own for an RPG I'm playing, because that would take away from the collaborative joy of creation. Everything I make for the game on my own is one less thing we can make for the game as a group.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, I think there is definitely a place for creative activities in RPGs which are separate to "role playing". From what you've written, it sounds like you're interested in premade game materials, as created by one player independently. I think a far more interesting question is the idea of game materials collaboratively created by some subset of the players. However, if that's not what you want to talk about here, then I won't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84549">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84549/#Comment_84549" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-01T07:20:32+00:00" title="August  1, 2007  7:20AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Martin O'Leary</cite>Heck, I even resent having to turn up to regular sessions of a game, but that's probably just me.</blockquote>\nHah, I think that's just you bro.  :-)<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84554/#Comment_84554" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-01T07:38:44+00:00" title="August  1, 2007  7:38AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Even with some theater and improv behind me, I'm pretty slow on the draw in some areas. <br/><br/>So:\n<ol>\n<li>I like to bring quick references that allow me to generate interesting characters on the fly.</li>\n<li>I like notes about existing characters and places that I wouldn't want or be able to memorize.</li>\n</ol> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kaare%20Berg" title="Kaare Berg"><img alt="Kaare Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kaare%20Berg">Kaare Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84596/#Comment_84596" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-01T08:46:27+00:00" title="August  1, 2007  8:46AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I empathise with your points, except for point three.

I play a lot of different games, and different games require different prepwork.<br>b) My ideal prepwork is one that is exactingly presented in the game text -- <em>Dogs</em> town creation being a great example, but so is <em>Roach</em>, in that there isn't any prepwork and that's exactingly presented in the text.  I am increasingly annoyed by games that don't give step-by-step guidelines on how to prepare what needs to be prepared.  GMing is not a universal skill, no matter how much gamers may want it to be, and the assumption that prepwork can just be handwaved and still come out right is just ass.<br>c) Generally speaking (which is a mistake), I prefer prepwork that gives me a network of people, places, and organizations and how they are problematically related.  Again, <em>Dogs</em>, but even clearer, the situation engineering in my own game, <em>FLFS</em>.  Player flags are very nearly a requirement for my appreciation of the generated prepwork.<br>d) Now I contradict my 'generally speaking' from the prior bullet point.  I prefer prepwork which works from within the game and uses everybody at the table, and does so in real time, face-to-face, and makes prepwork part of the at-the-table play experience.  There are a couple tricks to learn (and those tricks are of differing utility in different games), but this is not actually hard, just different.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84650/#Comment_84650" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-01T10:01:39+00:00" title="August  1, 2007 10:01AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 1, 2007 10:11AM by lachek.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John, your PDF sums up all the interesting bits of half a dozen RPGs I paid good money for on two pages.

I would be very interested in a product that taught me how to quickly make functional NPCs for their game. Dogs kinda tries doing this, but I find pseudo-NPCs a bit too loose and I'm worried that players would think I'm defining the "perfect trait exactly when it's needed". I'd prefer a bit more structure, while still keeping the character fluid enough to fit into a wide variety of situations. Half-finished Spirit of the Century NPCs is more what I'm going for.<br><br>I've also had some past success bringing "stuff" - handouts, maps, trinkets. The problem with handouts is that they're often a big time investment if they don't really matter in the long term. I will always keep my character's "Wanted" poster, for example, but the carefully prepared note that said "Come to the XYZ high school, we have shelter and food but need medical supplies" seemed a bit of a wasted effort on the GM's part. I love city maps (I usually print full-colour transit maps or satellite pictures for games set in modern day), mall floor plans and the likes. I find players and GM alike can easily fill in cool content and riff off existing content on the map. Location photographs and portraits are also useful for similar reasons.

We play with it in the center of the table.<br/><br/>He also brought photos of <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3604&amp;page=1#Item_21" rel="nofollow">some cool historical gun/swords</a>.<br/><br/>Brandon brought a bunch of photos he gleaned from Flickr or Venice streets, people, and cool Venetian masks. We do this a lot with our games now. When someone starts narrating anything that resonates with a particular photo, they or another player grabs a phot and puts it in front of that player. It's like having a library of extras and plot elements you can grab quickly.<br/><br/>John made a list of the cheif families of Venice and wrote them on a cue card. When an NPC shows up, it's natural to glance at the card and give them a family name. This gives NPCs instant context.<br/><br/>We also have cue cards for all the cheif characters, some historical, some a-historical. Some cue cards never get used, which is fine. This is super helpful with Principia because all keys are explicitly related to people, places, and things in the game. When I buy a new key, it's natural to glance around for a good NPC to relate it to.<br/><br/>We also keep a relationship map tacked to the wall.<br/><br/>I think John also has some notes about the NPCs he's put out into the world. If the relevant NPC becomes important, he can pull out the notes. I think these are pretty sketchy; not much more than what ability they're best at.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84782/#Comment_84782" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-01T13:58:52+00:00" title="August  1, 2007  1:58PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: pells</cite>Dogs, for instance, uses a very powerful design for towns, that corresponds exactly to the needs of this game !!

Couple of things first, while reading your comments :<br/>- Am I the only one who thinks we don't have many possibilities concerning plot design ? I mean, regarding systems, we have a lot of choices, depending on what we want to play, but plots ? And I hear you say "we don't really need many designs for plots ...", but I think yes, we do. Because different types of stories uses different types of narration structure, everywhere else outside of rpgs, so why souldn't it apply to our hobby too ?<br/>- I won't be talking about Avalanche, but ... a couple of comments strike me with what I'm doing, with some of my initial concerns regarding plots. So, I'll play with some of Avalanche's ideas, concepts.\n<blockquote>As such, it's quite hard for me to imagine myself enjoying something which required me to even read a setup like the one you describe, let alone create one.</blockquote>\nBut why should it be an homework ? It's true, I believe, that the typical modules are a real pain to read !!! But, I also believe we should come with something that is fun to read ... that way, DM's preparation should be exciting, something like reading a novel or seeing a movie.\n<blockquote>I'm not entirely sure what you mean by "specific design", but if you mean a defined procedure by which material is generated for use in future sessions, then yes, I think that's a great idea. Actually, I think it's a great idea whether you mean it or not.</blockquote>\nYes, that's what I mean. And the same design might be used, I believe, to report the game session and prepare the next one.\n<blockquote>I won't make things on my own for an RPG I'm playing, because that would take away from the collaborative joy of creation. Everything I make for the game on my own is one less thing we can make for the game as a group.</blockquote>\nI understand your feelings, that's also why I play. But, as a DM, I do believe that if I want to be able to create things with the players, I need to bring something, to write a part of my own. I don't believe we can create everything at the table. Now, what do we bring ? Some plots, characters, settings, situation, do we expect a role from the PCs ? That's the purpose of this thread. Because I believe that what we bring, how we design it, really have an influence on the game play experience.\n<blockquote>Nonetheless, I think there is definitely a place for creative activities in RPGs which are separate to "role playing".</blockquote>\nI'm not talking about "how to create things in collaboration during game play", but "how to create things before play that will allow, help the group (players and DM) to be able to create things in collaboration during play" (or, I you prefer, "how to generate prewritten material that won't come in the way of this objective"). As for creative activities separate from rpg, I have a problem with it. Because, somehow, that is what is already done. You mainly have two choices in the "mainstream" (ie main audience) rpg : buy a typical setting/modules, that don't work, because of its structure, or get an inspiration from a media that is not meant for rpg. What I'm looking for is to create something specific for the rpg, meant for it, right into it (and not separate) !!!\n<blockquote>Even with some theater and improv behind me, I'm pretty slow on the draw in some areas. </blockquote>\nMatt, couple of quick questions : in what context do you need those ? What do you need to create interesting characters ? What design do you use ? What kind of notes exactly ?<br/>I do have a problem with the term "memorise". For me, you bring something to the table (you create things on your own), be it "in your head" or "on paper". The difference for me is marginal.\n<blockquote>I empathise with your points, except for point three. I need the players to interfer with the goings on, that is where we get our plot.</blockquote>\nI don't know, but for one thing I want the players to have freedom. Maybe they are not interested in what is going on. But our needs might be different ...<br/>I guess the situation you prepare already includes, somehow, the PCs (ie the situation is not "generic", but written for the PCs) ?\n<blockquote>I love prep as long as I can do it in less than 1 hour. </blockquote>\nI agree on that too. Nice template by the way. How do you fill it ? Do you fill it all before the game or do you add things during play ? It seems to me like a good way to summarise a typical rmap and bangs/kickers. But, honestly, I have a problem with the "why should the players care" and "what are the players expected to do" cases ...\n<blockquote>b) My ideal prepwork is one that is exactingly presented in the game text </blockquote>\nJoshua, very good point, I'll try to keep that in mind. And as we discussed earlier, yes, different context generates different needs, thus, different designs.\n<blockquote>Player flags are very nearly a requirement for my appreciation of the generated prepwork.</blockquote>\nWhere can we find more about this ?\n<blockquote>I prefer prepwork which works from within the game and uses everybody at the table, and does so in real time, face-to-face, and makes prepwork part of the at-the-table play experience.</blockquote>\nJoshua, then again, and I know it may seem odd given the quantity of prewritten part in Avalanche, but I agree with you. I want prepwork that will help me at the table !!! Prepwork should be oriented toward that !!\n<blockquote>I used to write novels and bring them to the table, then get upset when the players didn't fulfill their roles quite as well as they had in my head.</blockquote>\nThat's because novels are not meant for rpg. This design doesn't work (too linear, single point of view, expected role for the PCs).\n<blockquote>No, that's not how it works in PtA (where there is no prep, and everyone is supposed to ensure those Next Week items occur) but the same technique can be used in any game, really, to help the GM in figuring out what things the players would like to see more of.</blockquote>\nQuick note : Avalanche works a bit like since it is calendar based. And it provides a "web of events", of which you won't use everything. Some tensions will be used, others not (your "what the players would like to see more of").\n<blockquote>Then I can assemble things together from a big library of situations.</blockquote>\nCould you explain this a little more ? How do you build this library ? Are those situations "waiting" for the PCs ?\n<blockquote>Little pieces make big jobs easier.</blockquote>\nThat's also what I think : dividing the various plots into single pieces, related to each others. Dividing to conquer : getting the big picture from a lot of single pieces. But maybe, that's not exactly what you meant.\n<blockquote>We also have cue cards for all the cheif characters, some historical, some a-historical. Some cue cards never get used, which is fine.</blockquote>\nWhy are some cards not used ? Do you find it to be a waste of time ? Does that mean that some parts of what's prewritten won't be used ? And yes, "stuff" is useful. But I'm not sure how much of what you described (photos, for instance) can be considered as "prewritten" ...\n<blockquote>I'm kind of amazed I never see this mentioned, but the Town Creation rules in Dogs in the Vineyard are a complete match-up to the Relationship Map in Sorcerer's Soul (a supplement for Sorcerer.)</blockquote>\nThat leaves us with not much designs ? And, I'll try to check that out ...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_85237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85237/#Comment_85237" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-03T06:10:10+00:00" title="August  3, 2007  6:10AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: pells</cite>Matt, couple of quick questions : in what context do you need those ?

To create impromptu characters I like having short lists of ideas in front of me. Things like names, physical descriptions, personalities, wants. They don't have to be exhaustive lists. Maybe 8-10 words each. I look at them and sometimes I'll use a word on the list, and sometimes it will remind me of yet another word.

Like last night's Burn Notice episode - a repo man drives off with a boat full of cash, sought both by the boat owner and by the corrupt cops who hired him.<br/><br/>On one index card I write 'repo man' on another 'boat full of cash', on another 'Jamaican money courier' and on another 'corrupt cops'. (Actually I already have an index card for corrupt cops, that was like the first one I ever made. I'm so predictable.)  I stick 'em in a box. Then when I am bored, or need a situation, I just start pulling out cards and sticking them together in any way that remotely makes sense. Sometimes I put stats on the cards for NPCs. This is also a way that I make high-prep activities like D20 NPC generation easier, by doing it in small pieces whenever I get the urge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_85279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jbuchert" title="jbuchert"><img alt="jbuchert" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jbuchert">jbuchert</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85279/#Comment_85279" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-03T07:55:50+00:00" title="August  3, 2007  7:55AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 3, 2007 7:57AM by jbuchert.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Though I've been trying to change my habits (because of the workload involved), I'm pretty extreme in the pre-game preparation department. For me, it is also an enjoyable part of the process, because I love creating a world that is rich in depth and - more importantly - NPCs which are complex and engaging. It's something I enjoy seeing, so I do that for my own games. That's not to say that I can't appreciate a game with little to no prep, especially if the game is intended to be relatively short, but it rarely seems to work out that way for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do I bring to the table? Well, all this is going to sound a lot more organized than I actually am, but let's see. I usually have some idea/premise which I think I can sell to the players in some form or shape, perhaps one in which I've already  inquired for interest. Around that core and keeping in mind what it is that the players might possibly draw from that idea, I start working on the world. I draw maps (gets me thinking), define histories for locations (creates depth and purpose) and think about what might happen in the future (for player hooks, bangs, et all).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next thing I do is I work on the NPCs based on that. If there is something that needs to be said about the setting, I make sure there is an NPC to do it. For example, if there is a conflict/issue, I want one NPC to exemplify that conflict/issue. Then I basically draw all these guys together in a relationship map, though I very rarely use an actual graphical implementation of the concept. I try to leave the NPCs in tense situations which are just waiting for some outside force to walk into it, spurring a conflict.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point, after weeks and far too many hours, I have a lot of stuff, much of which may not ever see the light of day in game. I accept that fact. The next step - as we go into our first session - is to turn these into GM flags, ie. I give the players the option to buy into them - to buy into the setting and the conflicts. If they like a particular thing, we'll work their character somehow into it. The ideas which the players don't necessarily take to either a) disappear, b) become part of the fabric of the world/setting, c) remain in the background until such a day comes when they can be utilised or d) all of the above. I also ask the players what kind of NPCs they'd like to see or they would need to bring out aspects of their characters and I work their wishes into everything. Sometimes it means converting existing ideas, sometimes it means all new ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter I've heard the players and seen what they are interested in, I tend to go back to what I've created and give it a thorough shakedown. Now I know how the PCs fit into everything, so I make the situations more centered on them, more dependent on them walking in, etc. This is just a final trimming, but I think it is a pretty crucial part of the process. A lot of the ideas that I find incompatible go to file to be used in later.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnwards from that, is <i>play</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_85296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85296/#Comment_85296" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-03T08:32:11+00:00" title="August  3, 2007  8:32AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chris Chinn had an excellent series of posts on his blog about pre-play prep.

So, you build "the puzzle" during play, choosing pieces almost at random. Quite different than what I do.\n<blockquote>What do I bring to the table? Well, all this is going to sound a lot more organized than I actually am, but let's see. I usually have some idea/premise which I think I can sell to the players in some form or shape, perhaps one in which I've already inquired for interest. Around that core and keeping in mind what it is that the players might possibly draw from that idea, I start working on the world. I draw maps (gets me thinking), define histories for locations (creates depth and purpose) and think about what might happen in the future (for player hooks, bangs, et all).</blockquote>\nI also work that way, believing history is a very important part of the process of creating a coherent world. And of course, the workload is pretty heavy.\n<blockquote>The ideas which the players don't necessarily take to either a) disappear, b) become part of the fabric of the world/setting, c) remain in the background until such a day comes when they can be utilised or d) all of the above.</blockquote>\nA quick question : what happens to those parts ? Do they stay "on hold", waiting for the PCs or they live their own lives, advancing a kind of plotline while the PCs do other things (ie when PCs would finally encounter those parts, it wouldn't be at its original "state") ? This is important to me since I want not only a coherent world, but also a coherent <i>living</i> world. But maybe that's not what you're looking for.\n<blockquote>Courtesy the Wayback Machine<br><br/>Flag-Framing<br/>The Conflict Web</br></blockquote>\nVery interesting articles. I agree with the way it proposes to build the prewritten part, but I would go a bit <i>further</i>. Let me explain (and by the way, this discussion helps me explains what I'm doing). Following quotes are from the articles.\n<blockquote>The Focus is the basic idea or situation of what the game is going to be about. Everyone in the group ought to know what this is- "A fight for the throne!", "Destroy the One Ring", "The Battle of Troy", whatever.</blockquote>\nI want, and this is course, a need of mine, to work on many different focus occuring at the <i>same time</i>. What I'm looking is a game where "there is a fight for the throne" while "destroy the one ring" while "there is the battle of Troy". In my opinion, there is already a moral issue at hand at the very beginning, since the PCs wouldn't be able to adress all the issue, take part in all the focus. Note that PCs may "jump" from one focus to another. Also, if there are multiple focus, it means the world doesn't evolve only around the focus the PCs are interested in.\n<blockquote>This technique is specifically designed to create the crazy multilayered relationships you see in epics like Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Heroes of the Watershed/All Men are Brothers, The Ramayana, The Mahabharata, Njal's Saga, and more modern fiction like Artesia or A Game of Thrones.</blockquote>\nThere is something that bothers me here ... For instance, in game of throne, I don't believe the specifity is only the layers of characters, but also, the fact that many things are happening <i>at the same time</i> in different parts of the setting. If you would start a game in Pyke or Lannisport or King's Landing, the game is completly different, but not only from a NPCs' point of view. And that is something I'm looking for that is not supported by this design.\n<blockquote>On the other hand you may have a cool foil for a PC (as proposed by JBR in FLFS) and create this before play, trying your damndest to hit player flags. It is still pseudo play, yet you are creating a socket. It all boils down to scale doesn't it, going from open to closed.<br/><br/>The more open the more socket, the more closed the more assertive.</blockquote>\nI believe different preps generate different types of games. At some points it comes down to playing preference I guess.\n<blockquote>You set the scene, paint the backdrop &amp; place the NPCs. How they interact with that is up to them. I have to be flexible with players who tend to wander off the beaten track, but I have developed simple approaches to deal with them without rail-roading them.</blockquote>\nI don't think having some kind of prep means railroading, it mostly depends on the design. Of course, a linear, PCs centered, chapters based module will lead more likely to this.\n<blockquote>But for the purpose of the story and the plot, I have a campaign bible/diary that outlines the objectives and goals of NPCs. How the players impact on those determines the npcs reaction...which is based on a common-sense approach.<br/><br/>It also brings into play "blowback" Players having to face up to the unintended consequences of their actions...or lack of action as the case may be.</blockquote>\nThat's exactly what I do in Avalanche, using a calendar, containing "events" as the "bible". I also like what you present as actions/lack of actions from the PCs. As I see it, the "bible" is the reference in case PCs do not act, and if they do, the bible is being used to manage the PCs consequences on this "preplanned" course of actions. So, a question : what design do you use for your "bible" ?<br/><br/><b>General questions about this thread :</b><br/>- Maybe, finally, my original judgement that we don't have much choices toward prep might not be that right ...<br/>- Are we happy with what we have at our disposal ? Do you think we should continue to work on such designs ?<br/>- As I see it, those designs are not specifically tailored to generate plots centered on the PCs (or meant for them), so how come there are no plots products ?<br/>- Are my needs toward <i>multi focus</i> and <i>living world</i> so specific ? Nobody else is looking for that ?<br/>- Those technique we descibed above, are they common knowledge for the non indie, mainstream rpg market ?<br/>- What I like in prep design is that there are quite intuitives and somehow "simple" to understand. To some extends, most people are using "parts" or "variations" of them, but not structured enough.

Of course, you clould just "flow around" the PCs' changes and get "back on track", but that sort of invalidates all of their work.  Maybe this is one of those worries that "wouldn't actually happen in play", but the whole design concept bases its usefulness on the assumption that the PCs can't actually change what will happen to these plots, in which case, why would the PCs even bother?<br/><br/>I like the idea, but the calendar events would have to be big, unstoppable changes and the PCs' interest would have to in the "mini-events" spawned by the larger changes and not in the events themselves.

Whether or not we 'should' continue developing such things, it'll still happen. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>For Plots Products, I direct your attention to the grand failed experiment that was <em>Tribe 8</em>, by Dream Pod 9.  The game had a big, overarching metaplot and published segments of that metaplot as campaign books.  The first couple were great, but as time wore on, the players' actual experiences started to diverge from the expected progression of events (much like Ludanto worries about).  It got increasingly difficult to write material that would actually be useful for players, since their games at home looked less and less like the 'canon' timeline.  By the end of the publishing line, play had diverged so far that there was an attempt to 'reboot' the setting with a new generation of PCs.  It didn't work.  I think a lot of the mainstream market took <em>Tribe 8</em> as an object lesson and shied away from 'plot products' from there on out -- specifically, see how <em>Exalted</em> approaches this, by loading up all the 'plot' before play actually happens, and letting the PCs run wild from there.<br/><br/>In indieland, I think the basic approach to roleplay makes a plot product a difficult sell.  Indie games tend to be far less constrained than mainstream games in terms of 'what might happen' (generalized conflict resolution, rather than channeled conflict resolution, will do that), leading to wild differences in play content (but not play experience).  Additionally, the DIY aesthetic of indie gamers means fewer folks interested in a product that gives them material that they "can make themselves."<br/><br/>Your multi-focus, living world preferences are not uncommon, but I think a good portion of your wants are tilting at windmills.  It's relatively easy to create a 'living world' simply by playing for an extended period of time and reincorporating material from earlier sessions.  I still don't see the value in 'multi focus' when only one focus matters -- what happens at the table.  Me personally, and this is a big indie mindset thing, I play different games for different foci, and since I select which game I play, I don't mind (and in fact prefer) when the game comes with a prepackaged focus.  I select what focus I want by selecting the game I play.<br/><br/>As for what's common knowledge in the non-indie mainstream market... your guess is as good as mine.  The thing of it is, even if you provide strategies that a customer already knows, presenting it <em>well</em> still makes it a valuable product.  A lot of people do stuff in a vague and unconscious way; providing an explicit procedure for what they're already doing is like turning the lights on.<br/><br/>Here's the thing -- the question for whether what folks are using is structured "enough" comes down to whether or not they're having fun playing.  There's no universal standard for "enough."  Different groups -- and different players -- will have different needs.  Hell, different players may have different needs for different specific games, even different specific sessions of games.  I think, at the end of the day, a good portion of gamers are having fun playing with what they have.  That doesn't mean that you can't provide a product that serves them well or even better than what they have -- but you're not going to be providing them something that they have no other solution for.  Human brains are story-making machines.  The game designs we make are simply tools that allow us to make stories better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_86638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86638/#Comment_86638" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-08T13:25:43+00:00" title="August  8, 2007  1:25PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My interpretation of the "multi focus" bit was different than JBR's, I thought it was more along the lines of, "Okay, during this play segment we're talking about all the main characters together!" and then next time "Okay, during this play segment we're talking about Matthew and his band members primarily as they try to make it to a gig in Schenectady" and then "Okay, during this play segment we're talking about the bad guys as they are summoned to a meeting in their secret evil lair."

I would say I hope the multi focus aspect would allow to still use the product as they go (PCs may change a lot one focus, but changing all of them takes a lot of time) thru it. As for the web of events of Avalanche, well, it is <i>very</i> big, but at a given time (here I'm taking about metatime), the DM uses only a part of it. Finally, since it is calendar based, you need to play it on day by day basis, thu it will always be about small events, mostly created by the DM (ie PCs won't go from major event to major event) and while playing it, the group really have a sense of daily activity ; a very strange feeling of the campaign (what matters, at the end, is the little thing you choose to do every day).\n<blockquote>Yeah, there are tons of different ways to prep a game, and there will always be new ways.

Thing is, I'm not sure it's that accepted in the indie "arena" that plot does matter.

I think it's not that true.\n<blockquote>I think a lot of the mainstream market took Tribe 8 as an object lesson and shied away from 'plot products' from there on out -- specifically, see how Exalted approaches this, by loading up all the 'plot' before play actually happens, and letting the PCs run wild from there.</blockquote>\nThanks for pointing me out those products, I'll check them very soon. That said, I don't think a metaplot is what should be the aim. Take the living campaign for instance from Wizard ; I can't be believe this could be useful, even sold as it is !!!<br/>I think that we can agree that prewritten stuff should be oriented toward a product <i>to build upon</i> and not <i>to follow</i>.\n<blockquote>It's relatively easy to create a 'living world' simply by playing for an extended period of time and reincorporating material from earlier sessions.</blockquote>\nI don't think it is <i>that easy</i>. Especially if you are looking at a high level of coherence. This would need a lot of prep work. And I think this is one of the reason it could be a product.\n<blockquote>I still don't see the value in 'multi focus' when only one focus matters -- what happens at the table.</blockquote>\nWe discuss this earlier, didn't we (in the initial thread) ? Multi focus is very, but very tricky. Things are happening differently at the table because of that. For instance, and I have seen it playing Avalanche, the PCs are "working" on a focus, and suddlendly, an event occurs from a different focus, and the PCs decide to change the focus they're working on. But, to do that (bringing events from other focus) very easily, without a lot of prep, I think you need a specific structure.\n<blockquote>As for what's common knowledge in the non-indie mainstream market... your guess is as good as mine.

And yes, providing a way to do things might be a product in itself. But look at the elements we brougth out quite easily (rmap, NPCs creation, way to use it at the table without railroading), can't we build and sell a beautiful product just based on this and that would look nicer than the typical modules they are selling out there !!!\n<blockquote>Here's the thing -- the question for whether what folks are using is structured "enough" comes down to whether or not they're having fun playing.

I can tell you that most players are happy at the end of the day, so why create new games, new systems ?<br/>And I'm not saying that there is <i>a</i> structure for plot ; there are many, thus many kind of products.

Look at the number of "indie" games being produced each year ; for each of them, didn't we have no other solution ? And yes, human brain is a story-making machine, but not <i>that</i> good. Otherwise, why would people go see a movie or read a book ? There are still people that are better than others at creating stories and there are people that suck at this.\n<blockquote>It all still happens at the table, right? Or am I confuzzled?</blockquote>\nYes, everything still happens at the table. I understand focus (in the context of this thread) as "what will the game be about". For instance, it could be "save the throne", and at the table, you play various scenes (or play segment) concerning this focus. One of my need is to have multi focus, which means "save the throne" while "destroying the one ring" for example. PCs wouldn't be able to take part in all of the focus (but note that the focus may, and should, cross over each other at some point), so you can't tell beforehand what the game will be about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_86952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86952/#Comment_86952" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-09T10:01:32+00:00" title="August  9, 2007 10:01AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: pells</cite>Thing is, I'm not sure it's that accepted in the indie "arena" that plot does matter.</blockquote>\nJust checking for clarification, here, when you say 'plot' you mean 'prewritten, prepared plot', yes?

System is how the players interact with each other and the story.  It's about the people involved and the activity that they are doing.  Changing the system changes the experience directly.  Plot is one characteristic of the story.  It's not about the people involved, and it's a product of what they are doing.  Changing the plot only changes the experience indirectly, and pretty inefficiently.  You seem to keep coming back around to this assumption that, to play, you must have a plot, and that's simply not the case.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86981/#Comment_86981" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-09T10:56:30+00:00" title="August  9, 2007 10:56AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Just checking for clarification, here, when you say 'plot' you mean 'prewritten, prepared plot', yes?

And yes, you're right, the indie scene tends to focus more on games that needs little to low prep. Does that produce awesome games ? I trust you !! But I don't get your empirical evidence on this ... which evidence ?<br/>Don't get me wrong here, but plots does matter a lot. I believe (really a big guess) that more people are using "plots" as a way to create narrative game than systems. How many people are playing d20 in an abashed or almost freeform style play, because the system doesn't do what they want, and uses plot to generate better stories without railroading ?\n<blockquote>Certainly we can put together a well-designed product, but we do not have a good idea of whether the market will demand that product outside of intuitive hunches of what gamers want and need.</blockquote>\nWe can say the exact same thing about the indie scene today.\n<blockquote>I think you might be surprised.</blockquote>\nI'd liked to !!! Don't get me wrong here, I'm really an humanist (with the concept of hope being central in my conception of the world), but we look at network TV (wasn't it you who talked about it in another thread ?), I'm quite despaired. Most people are looking for stories they already know. Well, I don't know. I guess "creating" stories as we do in rpg, as a hobby, is a "typical thing" ...<br/><br/>Now, where we don't agree ... and I understand why (which, by the way, may be worth another thread). But first, I'd like to make a very important statement : Avalanche is meant to be a mainstream product. Very mainstream. You're not my target customer, nor is anyone from the indie scene.\n<blockquote>I don't get your seeming desire to get plot the same sort of precedence and necessity as system. System is how the players interact with each other and the story. It's about the people involved and the activity that they are doing. Changing the system changes the experience directly.</blockquote>\nBecause, I think, that for the typical players "out there" (outside the indie scene) plot is easier to "get" ; that's what they produce, that's what the session is about. And they are playing d20, whitewolf stuff ... And I also believe that changing plots changes the experience very much. Have you tried playing Dogs using the old linear structure of modules ? If you play building up a puzzle from random cards or from a bible of events, it changes a lot of things !!!<br/>It's like, in the indie scene, if the plot would always come in the way. And in the mainstream market (let's say typical players I know) system comes in the way ...\n<blockquote>You seem to keep coming back around to this assumption that, to play, you must have a plot, and that's simply not the case.</blockquote>\nNo, you don't need one, I agree. But most players do (even in the indie scene), especially for those who rpg means campaign and not single session game.<br/>Quite honestly, we played Avalanche using d20 for a long time, then switch to TSOY. We all agreed that this system was better (in responding to our needs of play), and that it changes the experience of play. But, we also agreed, that the main difference at the table was the way the plot was built.<br/><br/>What I'm saying is two things :<br/>- The indie scene seems to focus only on one thing : systems. But plot is also important : dogs is the exception, a good one. And we have needs concerning prewritten part, don't we ?<br/>- If we want to target the mainstream audience, plot seems to me a more intuitive way. Avalanche is going to be multi plots. My objective is to bring mainstream customers, using d20, and by proposing TSOY, to introduce them to narrative systems.<br/>Anyway, about the latest point, I think I'll need another thread for that ...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_86998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86998/#Comment_86998" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-09T11:38:24+00:00" title="August  9, 2007 11:38AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, if you're talking about this product that provides plots for the mainstream market... why are you talking about it here?  I think a big chunk of my disconnect throughout this and other threads has been my assumption that you're talking about a product that you expect posters on this forum to be interested in.<br/><br/>I think a Book of Plots could be a very successful product in the mainstream market -- assuming you can finagle the appropriate exposure and distribution.  But that's because the mainstream market only follows mass media rules for success, so all you need there is exposure and distribution and you get success.  I am sure such a product could be marketed in such a way to get mainstream gamers frothing at the mouth over how much detail and plot and stuff is in the book.  I remain highly skeptical that it would be functionally useful in their play at the table -- and I would expect them to not notice this fact in the least.  To be totally frank, this would be a prime example for me of bad publishing and bad marketing: printing something that nobody needs and telling them that they do need it.

You write:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: pells</cite>No, you don't need one [plot], I agree. But most players do (even in the indie scene), especially for those who rpg means campaign and not single session game...<br/><br/>- The indie scene seems to focus only on one thing : systems. But plot is also important : dogs is the exception, a good one.</blockquote>\nNow, I'm beginning to suspect there's a huge disconnect between how I think about game and how you do, but let me run something by you.<br/><br/>First, when you use the word "plot" do you mean a "pre-written plot"?  If so, could you use that phrasing, so I know what you mean.  (As Joshua has pointed out, all games end up with a plot. But I think you're speaking of having a plot ahead of time, right?  If so, say, "pre-written plot" or something like that so I know what you're talking about.)<br/><br/>Second, here are some games other than <i>Dogs in the Vineyard </i>that are not one session games that don't have pre-written plots:<br/><br/><i>The Mountain Witch<br/>Sorcerer<br/>Primetime Adventures<br/>The Roach<br/>HeroQuest</i> (easily, at least the way I would play it)<br/><br/>Just off the top of my head.<br/><br/>Each of these games requires different kinds of pre-play prep: some have a lot of front-loaded work (though none are in the "pre-plotted" vein) like <i>Sorcerer</i> and <i>Mountain Witch</i>, some are pick up and go with the group at the table (like <i>PtA</i>), and others would need a pre-plotted method ported in whole-cloth (like <i>HeroQuest</i>.)<br/><br/>So, what are you saying? Because what you are saying seems to be flying the face of reality. But since I'm not sure what you mean by "plot" I'm having trouble keeping up.<br/><br/>Also, you seem to be equating "indie-games" with "single-session" games. None of the games I've mentioned above are single sessions games.  Are you assuming this is true? Because some are.... And some aren't.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87043/#Comment_87043" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-09T13:14:22+00:00" title="August  9, 2007  1:14PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I guess, nobody will like my answer ... Anyway.\n<blockquote>Okay, if you're talking about this product that provides plots for the mainstream market... why are you talking about it here?</blockquote>\nTo be honest, I gain a lot from the indie scene. But mainly, my product is far from finished and, as you can see, I have a really hard time explaining what I do. I guess that if you can understand, mainstream market will too. Also, I like theory, and I can explain what I do thru theory (the big model), which seems nice to me. Finally, I definitly respect what is produced on the indie scene and the "return from from experience" that is shared. That said, I do a something very different.\n<blockquote>I remain highly skeptical that it would be functionally useful in their play at the table -- and I would expect them to not notice this fact in the least.</blockquote>\nThat's mostly where we diverge ; I think it is useful !!! And I think that some people would need such a product ; and I think it might be a good way to promote the indie scene ...\n<blockquote>Your repeated claim that "we have needs concerning prewritten plot" seems to keep boiling down to "gamers need prewritten plot because they're dumb."</blockquote>\nCome on Joshua !!! I'm not saying anyone is dump !!!! I'm saying we should have concern about prewritten plots because most people care about it. They are not dump ; that's how they play. And that's how I play ...\n<blockquote>You can certainly continue to do so, and even find some financial success down that road. But how long do you really want to make watered-down product for people you don't respect?</blockquote>\nBut I do respect them !!! And Joshua, I don't think I'm producing a watered-down product : I like producing Avalanche. I admit, I have an author's stance point of view on it, but still, I find it much more interesting than writing a novel for instance.<br/>And, there are, in many other medias, good mainstream products that don't only rely on marketing.<br/>Quite franckly Joshua, I don't know ... For me the indie scene is "independant publishing", whatever you publish ... I've discovered it two years ago, found out nobody what doing what I'm doing. What I can say ? I've been working very hard on Avalanche, and I still do, and I hope to publish the best product possible. And I don't think it's useless. I know what it does (manage complex prewritten plots, dealing with many focus, based on a calendar), I know what are its weakness (PCs who influence so much the plot that some part of the web of events crumbles and becomes useless). At first, it was supposed to be systemless, thanks to the indie scene it has become multisystems and I've added things like rmap, which are a "must", according to me. The indie scene betters my product, my comprehension and presentation of it ...\n<blockquote>I donno. There've been prewritten plot books in the mainstream market for years. We called 'em modules, then campaign books.</blockquote>\nAnd my questions would be : what design they did use ? Did it help us at the table ? I'm not talking about the content, but the container, the structure ...\n<blockquote>Now, I'm beginning to suspect there's a huge disconnect between how I think about game and how you do, but let me run something by you.</blockquote>\nI think it is far away from susception now ...\n<blockquote>First, when you use the word "plot" do you mean a "pre-written plot"? If so, could you use that phrasing, so I know what you mean. (As Joshua has pointed out, all games end up with a plot. But I think you're speaking of having a plot ahead of time, right?</blockquote>\nTo be exact, I would mean, for the purpose of this thread, anything that you bring to the table ; that is already written. For Avalanche, I would say "defining prewritten situation that do not concern the PCs, and in which they can take part and alter the course". But yes, when I say plots, I mean pre-written plots, and I'm quite aware that any rpg games, for a given session, result in a plot.\n<blockquote>Each of these games requires different kinds of pre-play prep: some have a lot of front-loaded work (though none are in the "pre-plotted" vein) like Sorcerer and Mountain Witch, some are pick up and go with the group at the table (like PtA), and others would need a pre-plotted method ported in whole-cloth (like HeroQuest.)</blockquote>\nAnd you're right. I'm not denying that the indie scene doesn't take into account the generation of prewritten plots, be it whatever it looks like (rmap, kickers, bangs, focus, bible of events ...). What I'm saying is are we doing enough ? Does each game takes this into account ? Does it always respond to our needs ? To we have to rip off prewritten part structure from another game to incorporate them into existing ones ?\n<blockquote>Also, you seem to be equating "indie-games" with "single-session" games. None of the games I've mentioned above are single sessions games. Are you assuming this is true? Because some are.... And some aren't.</blockquote>\nI'm not equating indie games with single session, but would you agree that there is a BIG difference between what Wizard is selling (heavy setting, modules) and what the indie scene is ? I'm sorry, but for me, d20 is oriented toward <i>campaign play</i> and not sorcerer nor dogs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_87048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87048/#Comment_87048" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-09T13:34:06+00:00" title="August  9, 2007  1:34PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 9, 2007 1:42PM by Mike_Holmes.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've already identified the disconnect, but nobody paid any attention. <br/>\n<br/>\nSebastien, "Plot" is a terrible term for what you're talking about. Nobody objects to books that have setting and situation material in them. But when you say plot we think you mean railroading. Let's be plain. When you say, "I have a pre-written plot" that sure sounds like you mean "I am going to be sure that he last scene of play is the players killing the Dark Lord, and saving the realm." <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you believe that one can have a "pre-written plot" of this sort, but then also give the players the ability to determine plot, then you are believing in The Impossible Thing Before Breakfast, as Ron would put it. The GM cannot pre-determine the plot, drive to the conclusion of that plot, and it also be true that the players are determining their own plot. <br/>\n<br/>\nDitV, for instance, does not make up a "plot" in terms of it deciding how the events of play will go down. It creates a situation. The players create the plot by the decisions that their characters make. At least that's the verbage out community tends to use. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, your use of "plot" makes semantic sense, in that often the term is used to mean "The villain's plan" or just what the set-up for the story is. But then you have to be clear that these set-ups aren't meant to be played out to some pre-determined conclusion. I'd strongly suggest that you give up on the term plot, and use something like situation. Simply because there's no disambiguation required. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaking up situation information for play is quite common and not at all something that anyone objects to as a project. What people here object to is products that tell us what the end of the plot has to be. Like the monumental script of an adventure known as "At The Mountains of Madness" for instance. Which has text in it like, "When the PCs go chasing off after the bad guys..." <br/>\n<br/>\nAs an example of a situation set-up for my favorite game Hero Quest, here's a scenario: http://www.geocities.com/doctorpeace/well.html<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, as compared to the mainstream market, there's far less of this stuff commercially available from indie designers. But that's actually a result of the fact that we've determined that such products really aren't all that profitable. In fact you'll see more such stuff given away for free than published, as a way to support one's game. Because it's economically more viable to do so than to publish the material. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut that's not nearly the same thing as saying that the indie community thinks that situation materials and such are a bad thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87056/#Comment_87056" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-09T14:00:08+00:00" title="August  9, 2007  2:00PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heya, S\xc3\xa9bastien, I don't want, by any means, to be construed as telling you to shut up or take your thread elsewhere.

Okay, I would agree that "plot" is a very bad term ... but even "situation", no ? Because situation is always about the PCs, no ? Anyway, terrible problem ... Well, yes, what I'm doing is "The Impossible Thing Before Breakfast" and, quite franckly, it is hard, and it is complicated. But, that's the goal.

They also do not want to have to think about "sticking to the plot" or "not doing that because the GM won't like it". They want the illusion (at least) of freedom to do as they will in an imaginary world. So trad products won't work for them out of the box.<br/><br/>On the other hand, they do not want to take on Author, much less Director stance. They don't want to think about what would be thematic, or dramatic. They don't want to know things that their characters don't, on the whole. They want the illusion (at least) of a solid, consistent world, not one where the scaffolding and nails are clearly visible. They want the GM to have secrets that they can discover, not co-create. Thus a lot of indie games are not to their taste either.<br/><br/>The GM who would support these players has a difficult life. They must prepare enough detailed material that they can communicate a world with conviction and colour. This world must be full of interesting characters who are fun to meet. And it must have both interesting events going on without the PC's involvement, and opportunities for the PCs to have a real effect on it. Aspects of the world must be tailored to engage the PCs in interesting ways, without seeming too solipsistic or unbelievable. And at any moment the PCs can and will do something entirely unexpected that renders vast chunks of prep quite useless.<br/><br/>I don't see a lot of support out there for such a GM. Some, but not much. Little advice on how to prepare economically, or algorithms/models that they can use. Some of the "indie" theory is good, but can be hampered by incompatible underlying assumptions. Towns in Dogs has the right sort of idea, IMO, but it's very specific.<br/><br/>If you are proposing to build something that will help these GMs, I'm extremely interested. JBR said earlier in the thread "I am increasingly annoyed by games that don't give step-by-step guidelines on how to prepare what needs to be prepared." I quite agree, but it's no easy task for this category of game. If you can crack it, you deserve to sell a lot of copies. And I am certainly inclined to think there is untapped potential here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87189/#Comment_87189" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-10T00:24:17+00:00" title="August 10, 2007 12:24AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joshua, we'll settle for "situations" instead of "plots" to avoid any misundertanding.

I'll do that in the beginning of next week.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_87193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87193/#Comment_87193" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-10T01:57:55+00:00" title="August 10, 2007  1:57AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            S\xc3\xa9bastien,<br/><br/>Don't be discouraged. For one thing, I'm guessing English is not your first language (your English is excellent, but sometimes not idiomatic). If I had to say all that in French (my best second language), I would *really* suck. For another, rephrasing other people's ideas is what I do for a living. And I've done it for more than 15 years. So I hope I've learned something, somewhere, in all that time.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm happy I could be of service to you. If this product gets off the ground and needs editorial help, come and talk to me. I'm quite busy, but for something this interesting, I would try hard to make time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
