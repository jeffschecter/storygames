But many RPGs don't, and it seems presumptuous to assume their creators are all shameless deceivers or fools who don't understand their own games.<br/><br/>It's also tough for me to judge just when an RPG is or isn't being forthcoming about the goals of play.  What about when a game tells you the characters' goals, and the player primarily plays their character?  Good enough?  Not even close?<br/><br/>By "goals of play", I do <i>not</i> mean the key objective at any given moment, like "avenge my father's death" or "earn enough points to exit the dungeon".  Instead, I'm talking about the over-arching purpose of why we're playing at all.

Inspirational color is good, stuff about character goals is good, but when I assemble my buddies to play, I want to know, what's the purpose here?  When I say "the purpose is to see how these characters fare, given who they are and the world they're in", is that something that the game is hell bent on supporting, or is it just, like, my opinion?  I'd like to know before I bring a new game to people.  <br/><br/>If a rulebook is a "do what you want with this" toolkit, just tell me that, so now I know that it's on me and my friends to set our own goals.  If a rulebook is all about killing monsters and leveling up and getting cooler, then I'd want to have that spelled out for me up front too, so I can pitch properly, or choose a different game, or whatever.<br/><br/>Why doesn't every RPG tell me all this?  I can only guess at the possibilities:<br/>- Vagueness doesn't hurt sales.  Customers will project their own goals onto a game that doesn't contradict them.<br/>- Some customers buy RPG books for the fiction and flavor and sense of mystery, and overt statements of purpose would harsh that vibe.<br/>- Tradition and emulation of what's come before.<br/>- Some designers don't think in terms of player goals at all, and would be hard pressed to identify a purpose of play between "it's fun" and "the characters you can play are really cool".<br/>- Telling someone a goal is not the most important part of helping them pursue it.  Some designers may have concluded (with or without trying it first) that stating goals isn't actually helpful.  (I would, of course, disagree.)<br/>- Communication breakdown.  They're <i>trying</i> to state the game goal(s), but what sounds clear to them does not sound clear to me.  Flowery and fiction-based prose leaves me uncertain about the real-world facts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437751/#Comment_437751" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-25T22:04:37+00:00" title="August 25, 2014 10:04PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think a huge proportion of games - and game designers - simply don't know what they're for or what their purpose is.

I just got inspired to grab the closest rpg book here (well, second-closest - I chose not to consider Traveller 5th edition due to its obscure writing style) and look at what it has to say about the purpose of play (a better term than "goal" here, I think). The game I got happened to be <i>Earthdawn</i>, 1993 edition. Let's see what the purpose of playing <i>Earthdawn</i> is.<br/><br/>On p. 10, after a brief introductory fiction:\n<blockquote><i>Earthdawn is a roleplaying game designed for two to eight players. Like many other roleplaying games, Earthdawn has an open-ended style of play. That is, the game has no definitive ending, no preset time limit or number of turns of play, and no single goal that, when achieved, marks the end of the game. Unlike other types of games, however, there is no winner or loser. <b>The object of the game is to have fun while exercising your imagination.</b> When this happens, everybody wins.</i></blockquote>...(Some setting description)...\n<blockquote><i>In contrast to many other roleplaying games, characters in Earthdawn do not simply survive each adventure and become a little smarter or little richer. Earthdawn adds another dimension to roleplaying; its characters become heroic figures, accomplishing deeds so impressive that generation after generation will honor their memory in song and story. The world of Earthdawn brims over with legends, heart-stirring tales of famous adventurers told by the fireside to while away the night. <b>Earthdawn player characters can become the figures in those legends.</b> As they buid their characters' legends through play, they create the fireside tales that their descendants will tell about them. Gaining this heroic stature through daring deeds is as important a part of playing Earthdawn as any lesser gain riches or experience.</i></blockquote>\nOn the next page, a general introduction to roleplaying emphasizes certain features:\n<blockquote><i>Everyone has read a book or seen a movie where the protagonist does something so utterly wrong that the reader or viewer wants to shout a warning to the character. But no warning from the audience can keep that character from doing what the plot demands, no matter how much trouble it lands him in. The readers and viewers can't change the character's behavior; we're just along for the ride. A roleplaying game turns this situation on its ear. <b>In a roleplaying game the players control the actions, or play the roles, of their characters and respond as they wish to the events of the plot.</b> If the player doesn't want his character to go through a door, the character won't. If the player thinks his character can talk him or herself out of a tight situation rather than resorting to that trusty pistol, he can talk away. The plot of a roleplaying game stays flexible, always changing based on the decisions the players make for their characters.</i></blockquote>\nThat's then followed by an explanation of the traditional structural model: the GM creates and runs the world, the players run characters who experience the world. The purpose of the edifice is mentioned in passing later:\n<blockquote><i>The gamemaster describes the world as the characters see it, functioning as their eyes, ears, and other senses. <b>Gamemastering takes both skill and practice to master, but the thrill of creating an adventure that engages the other players, tests both their gaming skills and the characters' skills in the game world, and captures the players' imaginations makes the gamester's job worthwhile.</b> FASA publishes game supplements and adventures to aid the gamemaster, but talented gamemasters always adapt the game universe to suit their own style.<br/><br/>A roleplaying game offers its players and level of challenge and personal involvement unmatched by any other type of game. Because the players and gamemaster create the adventures they play, what happens in the course of a roleplaying game is limited only by the players' imaginations.</i></blockquote>\nAfter that comes a longer introductory story, then setting history, and although I won't go through the book with a comb right now, my impression is that the book doesn't particularly go into the purpose of the enterprise again before the GM section. I almost didn't check that, but there's actually a couple of pages more on trad structural theory of roleplaying in there. Page 230 discusses control of the game, mostly (it encourages GM fiat, because the GM is the one who bothered to put the game together, so they should decide everything about anything), but there's also this:\n<blockquote><i>Roleplaying games are first and foremost a form of entertainment. Think about it. Why do you play roleplaying games? To get together with some friends and have a good time.</i> [Then it goes on to suggest that you should stop, take a break and talk about it if the game stops being fun.]</blockquote>\nI'm sure there are many ways to interpret that, but what I take away from it is that <i>Earthdawn</i> has a purpose deeply embedded in the tradition of roleplaying, so far so that its authors treat the purpose almost as a given: roleplaying is fun, therefore we do it. This of course doesn't answer anything (such as, what is the fun thing), but we can read between the lines a bit and say that the Earthdawn theory of roleplaying is that it is fun to pretend to be a character in a story, and it is fun to tell stories for those characters to be in. And that's therefore the purpose of <i>Earthdawn</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437766/#Comment_437766" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-26T05:58:41+00:00" title="August 26, 2014  5:58AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>There's also a broad overlap between "game system" and "tool".

I read a blog post somewhere saying that GURPS is more like a game engine that you can use to create a game of your own. Many definitions of games includes a goal, but in a simulator you often make up a goal of your own. Take <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvzetzOH3Vk" rel="nofollow">Goat Simulator</a>, as an example. Saying that a game always must consist of a goal is to limit yourself in what kind of games you can do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437767/#Comment_437767" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-26T06:00:47+00:00" title="August 26, 2014  6:00AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 26, 2014 6:05AM by Rickard.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>By "goals of play", I do <i>not</i> mean the key objective at any given moment, like "avenge my father's death" or "earn enough points to exit the dungeon".

Mostly so it can attract the right kind of target audience, but also to make it easier to grok the mechanics. If the reader knows the game is about building group trust, then s/he can view each new mechanic in that light.<br/><br/>But is that really a goal?<br/><br/>A goal is a purpose but a purpose isn't a goal.

Such homilies often result in a description of purpose that is either uselessly vague, or mistaken altogether. (Quality issues with the game itself may also be involved in making a mission statement muddled: if the game's purpose is vapid or it doesn't have one, it's difficult to write a sharp and correct mission statement.)<br/><br/>Upon review <i>Earthdawn</i>, however, wasn't as bad as some games about this, so it's not by any means a perfect example for my initial purpose. I would still like to say that <i>Earthdawn</i> is really not sharply prescriptive in the way I like a game to express its purpose, but at least it does get in a few comments on the matter in between describing how to play. The mission statement is also reasonably accurate, I think; I haven't played the game, but I think I understand what it does and how, and saying that it's a vehicle for the GM to run adventures and players to run characters for the sake of reveling in fantasy stories is as accurate as any description I could manage. (Except maybe the interesting "Earthdawn is an attempt to fix D&amp;D into a more literary fantasy genre mold" analysis, but that'd certainly be too much to ask of the game text.)<br/><br/>So yeah, you may take this as an ambiguously successful attempt at demonstrating the traditional difficulties that games have in expressing their purpose <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437783/#Comment_437783" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-26T08:50:41+00:00" title="August 26, 2014  8:50AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I kinda disagree about the importance of telling the players the purpose of a game. It's a bit hard hot explain for me and it may have more to do with the way I'm interpretating what I'm reading in this thread, so don't judge my answer until you have readed my whole attempt at explainig this. I may not even be able to explain it in a single post but I'll try my best.<br/><br/>First, It's a Game. Everyone knows what's the purpose of a Game since we were little. It's meant to be an activity for having fun. So the real question is How is this game meant to be fun?<br/><br/>Second, not all games are obvious about the answer to the question above until things are set in motion and the game starts. And people are able and eager to accept this because there's the fun of discovery there too. They let their curiosity lead them until they get what is all about, so the fun of learning gets amplified by the surprise.<br/><br/>Think of it a bit, perhaps a better starting point is to think about boardgames; you see a boardgame, get curious about it, open it and try to understand what each piece of the contents is for. You compare the sum of that information to previous experiences and get an idea.

I've been analyzing the structures of board game manuals, because I'm going to use their thinking in my next game, and they ALWAYS start with the game objective: how the game ends. Always.<br/><br/>The procedures then <i>enforce</i> the game objective. That's why I talked about grokking the game mechanics.

"Fun" doesn't mean anything by itself. It's a buzzword. To quote Twilight Imperium:\n<blockquote>Welcome to a galaxy of epic conquest, interstellar<br/>trade, and political intrigue. TWILIGHT IMPERIUM<br/>is an exciting board game in which 3-6 players seek<br/>to <i>build a galactic empire </i>by the cunning use of <i>strategy,<br/>diplomacy, and resource management</i>. By <i>taking<br/>on the role</i> of a great interstellar race, players will<br/><i>seek the ultimate goal</i>: to claim the Imperial Throne<br/>on Mecatol Rex and lead the galaxy to a new age of<br/>glory.</blockquote>\nThat's how you have fun with this game.

And right after that, you can expand all you want on as many mechanics you think your game should have.</blockquote>\nI found this a good post that came close to a lot that I was thinking, though it misses in some particulars for me.<br/><br/>First and foremost if a game says 'rpg' anywhere then I go into it with two expectations based on the inherency of the name: first, it's a game, and the purpose is therefore to have fun, and second that the method of having that fun will be roleplaying (which generally means pretending to be a character in a story). <br/><br/>I know some are disparaging on 'fun' being a descriptive goal, but I have to disagree. The 'fun' isn't in achieving a goal. Fun IS the goal. It's had through the process of participating, not from trying to achieve what someone else decides is the goal.<br/><br/>For instance, In MtG the 'goal' is to reduce your opponent to 0 life, get them 10 poison counters, or make them run out of cards in their library before any of those things happen to you (at least in the old school game). Now, I can do that in my sleep. I can whip out the channel fireball deck and obliterate most players 75% of the time. But that's not fun to me (usually) and if it isn't fun then it's a failure of a game for me, because game requires fun before any other conditions or methods are dealt with.<br/><br/>What's fun for me is collecting cards, creating interesting decks, pulling off clever combos, and hanging out with friends being who we are. Those are things I wouldn't have understood from reading the rulebook (which I always do immediately btw), but only from actively participating and discovering it for myself. While I try to achieve the explicit goal during play, I can lose 100% of games and have a great time...meaning I'm fulfilled by something other than the written goals of the game. I suppose you could say I'm fulfilled by the unwritten rules of the hobby, not the written rules of the game itself.<br/><br/>So if we fiat that the over-arching purpose will always be 'fun', then all that's left is to determine the procedures and mechanics that will form the framework within which we seek to have our fun. I'd like that up front, and as simple as possible. Something like "Players portray their characters progressing through an ongoing story of the fantasy genre."<br/><br/>As to what the individual players goal will be in any given session, or for any given character, that's subjective and up to them, not the game designers (usually). Game designers just provide mechanical frameworks, or tools such as settings. What players choose to do with that will be up to them. Some will want to game the meta. Some will want to pursue the perfect personification of their characters. Some just want to be social. Some want levels, or power, or money, or whatever. Some want a contest, and others a strategic or tactical exercises. <br/><br/>It is true that some games will serve certain goals better than others, and it's very nice when designers realize this and state it up front. "This rpg is geared towards simulationist play, with a focus on explicit detail." No matter what designers MEAN for a game to be, however, it's almost guaranteed that players will take it in unexpected directions for their own reasons. <br/><br/>It's also true that there are some games with EXTREMELY narrow and pre-defined purpose. This is especially true of many modern independents. While there's nothing inherently wrong with such games I personally find them so limited as to lack much replayability. Basically once someone tells me exactly how I'm supposed to have fun, I almost never can have fun with it.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437803/#Comment_437803" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-26T15:06:13+00:00" title="August 26, 2014  3:06PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Fun" is such a vague word.<br/><br/>There are so many games people play on a regular basis which are clearly not pleasurable or enjoyable in any direct sense.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.justlaugh.com/online/vol2issue9/wc166.gif"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437804/#Comment_437804" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-26T15:08:00+00:00" title="August 26, 2014  3:08PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            LOL...

Would the Earthdawn book be a better product if it slapped its own version of "what are you going to make of this world?" or "enjoy being these characters in this world" on the back cover?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437807">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437807/#Comment_437807" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-26T15:47:33+00:00" title="August 26, 2014  3:47PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Little link to <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19335/text-mining-2-0-what-is-a-rpg" rel="nofollow">this thread over here</a>, for research purposes.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437808/#Comment_437808" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-26T15:54:14+00:00" title="August 26, 2014  3:54PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I actually find AW to be pretty thorough in answering this question, from the Agenda/Principles to the "Why You Play" (which is admittedly very lacking on its own) to the structure of the advanced moves and "Unwritten Future" chapter.<br/><br/>Given the hint-rather-than-explicitly-describe nature of the entire text, this aspect is pretty much front-and-centre.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437812/#Comment_437812" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-26T17:53:17+00:00" title="August 26, 2014  5:53PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            EarthDawn is mathematically the single best D&amp;D heartbreaker ever created.

(put here the goal of the game).<br/><br/>These are the first lines of the new D&amp;D free rules:<br/><i>"The Dungeons &amp; Dragons roleplaying game is about storytelling in worlds of swords and sorcery. It shares elements with  childhood games of make-believe. Like those games, D&amp;D is driven by imagination. It\u2019s about picturing the towering castle beneath the stormy night sky and imagining how a fantasy adventurer might react to the challenges that scene presents."</i><br/>CUT<br/><i>"Unlike a game of make-believe, D&amp;D gives structure to the stories, a way of determining the consequences of the adventurers\u2019 action. Players roll dice to resolve whether their attacks hit or miss or whether their adventurers can scale a cliff, roll away from the strike of a magical lightning bolt, or pull off some other dangerous task. Anything is possible, but the dice makesome outcomes more probable than others."</i><br/><br/>Do you believe that the goal of the game is clear? (a real question, to me it is but I've my mind somewhat biased by knowing d&amp;d.

I have to admit to skepticism as to how much of a player's actual play can concern reaching 20th level, moment to moment. The sure-fire way to achieve that would seem to be to low-ball your challenges consistently, but perhaps the goal isn't merely to reach level 20, but do it quickly and in style?<br/><br/>At our tables the player goal has been to select and resolve fictional challenges/missions/quests successfully, or fail gracefully like a sportsman.

What I attempted to convey was that I was hoisted on my own petard a little bit, insofar as you'd think that the only reason I could have for quoting chapter and verse from Earthdawn would be to prove how awful it is, and thus I was sadly surprised by how decent it was. (Which, I hasten to add, is not the case - I'd like to think that I'm not an unthinking zealot, and I may well crack open a book simply to see what's in there, rather than merely to confirm my own preconceptions.) What actually happened was, as I stated, that I found Earthdawn to have a pretty realistic understanding of its own nature and goals. Better than some texts I've seen, in which the tendency has been towards ambiguity and homilies. Not that Earthdawn is entirely free of those, but as stated, it's far from the bottom of the barrel.<br/><br/>I guess I could've desisted from posting, but I'd already collected the quotes, thought that others would find a practical example interesting, and it seems like a good practice in intellectual honesty to report your findings even when they support your hypothesis less than dramatically. Not that Earthdawn proves anything one way or another about anything, of course, but it is one arbitrary data point about how rpgs go about communicating their goals.

The title this time is <i>Fading Suns</i> second edition (1999). (One might ask why I'm only paving at core trad games here - the reason is simply that a friend unloaded a few hundred rpgs he's lost interest in into my hands in the spring, and they're sitting in my kitchen waiting to take a trip to my library. Causes a certain uncharacteristic trad skew in my current rpg reading materials.)<br/><br/>So, purpose and goals of play in <i>Fading Suns</i>. The book begins with an intro fiction, then explains roleplaying in general starting on p. 11. The description focuses on history, and is sparse of goals and purpose: playing rpgs started in the '70s, publishers put out complex game worlds for players to enjoy, games advanced into a wide variety of genres, etc. Then, about <i>Fading Suns</i> specifically:\n<blockquote><i>Fadings Suns is primarily a game about heroes and the dramatic conflicts they encounter, from palace intrigues to cliffhanging combats. It provides a frameworks for players to create games from any perspective they desire. If they want to play soldiers who fight evil with guns and fists, the rules are here. If they want to play merchants who prefer diplomacy to violence, or priests wrestling with metaphysical crisis, rules and helpful dramatic hints are also provided. Fading Suns is whatever the players want it to be.</i></blockquote>\nThat's followed by a "How to Roleplay" section that outlines the auteuristic GM role and the immersionistic player role, basically the same as <i>Earthdawn</i>, earlier. This emphasizes the superior interactivity of rpgs compared to "computer games touted for their interactivity", interestingly enough <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>The actual jackpot is in the next subchapter on page 13, "A Futuristic Passion Play". Here it is in its entirety:\n<blockquote><i>Fading Suns is primarily a science fiction game, which means that there are starships, blasters, powered armor, alien races, and weird science. But there are also many elements of traditional fantasy gaming: heroic characters and struggles, a feudal sociopolitical structure (noble lords, high priests and headstrong merchants), powerful artifacts and great mysteries. And there is horror: monsters and maddening discoveries revealing terrifying metaphysical truths.<br/><br/>In short, Fading Suns is a game which has everything a roleplaying universe needs in order to tell strories of such varied and exotic themes as can be found anywhere - in our very own world here and now. Why should our created unverses be more restrictive than the real world? By making them so, we only rob ourselves of the enriching heritage of stories left to us by previous generations from all corners of the earth. We owe it to ourselves to make our worlds as rich, vivid and complex (even maddeningly so) as that outside our doors.<br/><br/>Like all games, Fading Suns should be entertaining and fun to play. But roleplaying games can be more than mere pastimes. The players can strive for the same artistic goals as the author of a novel, a film or a play. Fading Suns is a passion play of sorts, a story about the triumphs and even tragies of its characters takes place in an imagined future. Many possible stories can be todl here, from galaxy-spanning epics to the most personal of tales.<br/><br/>Like medieval passion plays, Fading Suns deals with grand themes universal to the human experience. Its main theme is the Seeking. This is the mythological role all heroes play: the knight on a quest, seeking power to vanquish his enemies or the secrets of self-discovery. Success or failure on this quest is not as important as the insights learned while on it.<br/><br/>The atmosphere of the dramas played out in the Fading Suns is one of tragic ignorance. Civilization is in decline, and superstition and fear are everywhere. New ideas and frontiers are spurned by a nervous populace, fearful of change for the harm it brings. But it is just this sort of willful ignorance that keeps civilization from rising again. It is such fear that keeps hope buried and great challenges from being met. The player characters represent heroes who can break the bonds of this ignorance and bring something new and great to their culture, to reawaken and invigorate life.<br/><br/>Without further ado, we give you a glimpse into the tumultous fate of humankind four millenia from now...</i></blockquote>\nAfter that we get a long, long setting chapter and all the rest of the game. I'm just going to assume that that's everything pertinent for now, given the bonanza we have above.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437884/#Comment_437884" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-28T12:53:44+00:00" title="August 28, 2014 12:53PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Also, in case it's not clear: I got inspired to this extremely empiristic approach in delving into the subject by Jason. He's done this a few times in the past himself, and I've rather liked it when he's gone to the trouble of stripping unnecessary vagueness from discussion by showing exactly what a game text says. Not that this is the best approach to any topic at all, but when the topic of discussion is how game texts express games, it's more than appropriate.)<br/><br/>So <i>Fading Suns</i> here, I have to say that it satisfies me with the clarity and commitment of its mission statement, which comes in early in the book and doesn't make any bones about the supposed differences between this game and those that have come before. I didn't quote the standard trad rpg model of player roles up there, but rest assured that it explains clearly how the GM is the scriptwriter and the players get to make character choices, so that stuff is all in there to provide context for the ambitious artistic declaration provided.<br/><br/>I should note here that I consider <i>Fading Suns</i> a deeply mediocre game (never played it, but I've read it, and recently re-read), very much an emblem of the weaknesses (and some of the strengths) of the '90s tradition of design. That does not mean that the game cannot have a clear and useful statement of purpose, but in this particular case it does make me skeptical about the game's ability to actually fulfill its lofty goals: there is nothing much to <i>Fading Suns</i> the game that makes it do "futuristic passion play" except the gentle hopes and dreams of its creators - it's effectively one of those games that tells you to do it like this, and assumes that that's enough. For sure it <i>is</i> enough for the people who write and play games like this.<br/><br/>For those keeping track at home, it doesn't look good for my hypothesis up there about "traditional homilies" - I've checked out two games where I would not have expected in advance to find particularly clear mission statements, but it happens that neither are extremely vague nor mistaken in the way I expected. Either I'm laboring under an unnecessarily pessimistic picture of what rpgs say about their purpose, or I'm just hitting solid texts by accident <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437885/#Comment_437885" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-28T12:58:45+00:00" title="August 28, 2014 12:58PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>[...] priests wrestling with metaphysical crisis, rules and helpful dramatic hints are also provided.

They then tell the players (or themselves) just a general set of guidelines or ideas they've absorbed from other games or groups. Sometimes this works and sometimes it's a flop.  Usually it's a mixture of both at various times.

I was just thinking that I don't really read these parts of rpg books myself usually - I divine a game's purpose from what it does, instead of looking at what the game states its purpose to be. I'm sure it's the same for many others as well. GMs particularly are very unlikely to be very precise and fronted about the purpose of a game. This environment would easily leave me with the impression that games don't explain their purpose honestly or clearly.<br/><br/>I do remember a few rpgs that genuinely do have attrocious understanding of their own purpose, though. Perhaps I'll try digging up an intentionally bad example next...<br/><br/>Incidentally that's pretty much the way I define "the tradition of traditional roleplaying" <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> I've for the longest time held to an interpretation of rpg history that focuses on praxis, and how it cohered through the late '80s into just the phenomenon you mention: a heightened understanding of what roleplaying is, such that game texts and actual play practices all melded together into one big one-truth composite. (I do not mean by this that trad gaming is everything and anything; to the contrary, what roleplaying developed into during the '90s is a highly specific ideal, one that both <i>Earthdawn</i> and <i>Fading Suns</i> follow very closely.) Alternate traditions like the indies who allergically disclaim the received wisdom, or OSR people who disregard newer games, are notably different in important ways because of the assumptions they <i>don't</i> share with the main tradition.\n<blockquote><blockquote>[...] priests wrestling with metaphysical crisis, rules and helpful dramatic hints are also provided. Fading Suns is whatever the players want it to be.</blockquote>\nThis quote caught my eye.<br/><br/>How does this claim hold up?<br/><br/>Are there rules and helpful dramatic hints for how to make a "futuristic passion play" about priests wrestling with metaphysical crises?<br/><br/>That sounds interesting!</blockquote>\nI recently reread <i>Fading Suns</i> (after having originally checked it out in the early '00s), and I did pay particular attention to the magic rules, because those are often interesting in rpgs. Despite the interesting way in which the introduction characterizes the matter, the actual rules left me cold: the religious institutions are generally abstract, the religious super-powers ordinary, and the metaphysical challenges are mostly "superpower throttles" of the type familiar from '90s games. So you use your religious superpowers too much you turn into a monster, stuff like that. Actually I find that I don't really remember much about the details despite having just read the book through this spring.<br/><br/>Right, I just checked the book (still on hand here at the work station) to refresh my memory. The big mechanic for wizards/psions is called the Urge, which represents the animalistic side of the psion/wizard's psyche. As Urge rises, a Dark Twin awakens inside the psionicist, and when it gets sufficiently high, the Dark Twin detaches itself into an evil doppelganger. I'm pretty sure this is the sort of stuff the game means by "metaphysical crisis", because it doesn't exactly brim with metaphysics otherwise.<br/><br/>(The cleric/priest version is similar, except it's called Hubris, and it leads to a sort of "grass wilts wherever you walk" effect of bringing hell to earth when a highly hubristic churchman strolls by.)<br/><br/>Well, I guess the other facet of the matter are the various church doctrines - there's a bunch of different flavours of divine worship (with their own specific superpowers), sort of like Christian denominations or holy orders, and these could have political disagreements sort of like noble houses or merchant princes. I suppose this could be termed a "metaphysical crisis" within the church, too.<br/><br/>And then there is the Antinomy, secret star-faring devil-worshipper bad guys.<br/><br/>But yeah, no metaphysical struggles in the vein of Dogs in the Vineyard or such, no.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437894/#Comment_437894" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-28T14:32:46+00:00" title="August 28, 2014  2:32PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 28, 2014 2:33PM by JDCorley.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Science fantasy literalizes such struggles, so I'm confident the Dark Twin is what they're talking about there.\n<blockquote>I divine a game's purpose from what it does, instead of looking at what the game states its purpose to be.

I like to be <i>intimately</i> familiar with the way the mechanics operate on a <i>functional</i> level, which gives me a feel for <i>what kind of instrument</i> this is.  (Note: I am speaking from the position of a "trad GM" right now).  Admittedly when I'm less familiar with the system, I try to dutifully do what it tells me it's <i>supposed</i> to do, but this is not the ideal position to be in.  Like a musician with an instrument, your ideal relationship with the system will be immediate, fluid and visceral, a two-way street with no traffic lights.  Takes time to get there.<br/><br/>Sometimes the text explains itself well, but typically it doesn't.  That doesn't really surprise me since I'm also a programmer, and it's almost a truism that programmers are the last people to write a good user manual for their own programs.  So I don't bank on the auto-explanation being particularly helpful.  What makes more sense is grokking the way the system flows, the kinds of things it does well, and the spaces you're expected to fill in.<br/><br/>"Don't ask for the meaning, ask for the use." - Ludwig Wittgenstein<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437901/#Comment_437901" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-28T15:33:31+00:00" title="August 28, 2014  3:33PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes.

Of course it suffers of the one thing I never quite understood about Earthdawn: when you have this cool premise of emergence and reclaiming a world that's been in the hands of gigerian aliens for centuries, why has the setting been fast-forwarded (by about a century) into one where the PCs, instead of reclaiming past glories and bringing first contact between isolated kaers, do fetch quests for the dwarven magnates of Throal.

How to play it? No!<br/><br/>It's a lot of WHATs - components that you use. It doesn't tell anything about the purpose of the game or the "feel" that the game experience will tell you (WHY). It doesn't say anything about HOW you get that feeling. It's just an inventory list, just like if you were reading about what kind of tokens the game uses. You have to assume the rest, and assumptions comes from your previous experiences with a similar game. So why should anyone read "What is a roleplaying game" when the writers can't convey the WHYs and HOWs in a simple and clear way?<br/><br/>I agree with <a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">@Deliverator</a>.

This inspires me with a few possible interpretations:\n<blockquote>1) Going through those adventures is fun in its own right, that's why we play.  I <i>will</i> get through the jungle, I <i>will</i> survive the desert, I <i>will</i> discover the pyramid, etc.  It's not about "if", it's about enjoying the process and the particulars that bring it to life.  I expect the rules will contribute to the process of introducing and navigating adventure content.  My job is to bring an enthusiasm for the listed color, and roleplay in a way that creates the type of adventure stories listed.<br/><br/>2) All those examples sound like fun challenges.  I've played plenty of games where I try to get my character over some hurdle, or acquire some object, sneak somewhere, kill something, etc.  I like it.  This game is a chance to do that with the color of clockwork, jungle volcanoes, cannibals, and ape kings.  I expect the rules will set forth the strategic options which I must skillfully manipulate to achieve maximum success.  My job is to master the system (both formal rules and logic-of-play) and put forth my best effort to succeed in my objectives.<br/><br/>3) The emphasis on exotic locales means this is a discovery and exploration game, where characters grow and progress by investing in the GM's world.  Over the course of play, the characters will increase their connection to, and significance in, the fictional world.  I expect the rules will stay out of my way, occasionally arbitrating events which need it, while the GM shows me cool stuff and I poke at it.  My job is to find/decide what's cool, important, useful, and otherwise compelling in the places and events that are thrown at me.<br/><br/>4) This game doesn't have any rules that mandate a particular style of play, and I can play it as # 1, # 2, or # 3 above.  If I like one style but not the others, then it's my job to persuade everyone else to play this game that way I want to play it.</blockquote>\nSo, basically, it depends on my prior play experience.  In 1995, I would have assumed it was # 2, because that's what I knew.  In 2005, I would have assumed it was # 2, # 3, or # 4, because that's what I knew then.  Now, my best guess would be # 1, but that's largely from what I've seen Rickard post about the game elsewhere.<br/><br/>Being unclear about this stuff might be the optimal sales strategy.  If I only know one style, and you let me assume your game is that style, I'm more likely to buy it simply based on the flavor.  So if you're proud of your flavor, it's a reasonable strategy.  This would have been the way to get me to buy it in 1995.  <br/><br/>Today, though, I'm less likely to buy a game where I have no idea what my job is or what kinds of rules to expect.  Because now I know how open the possibilities are.  If there's a blurb below all that fictional color, and the blurb gives me some rules/job orientation, then great.  But if I have to dig too hard for those answers, only my absolute favorite flavor will keep me going.  And pulp ain't it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437961/#Comment_437961" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-30T17:13:36+00:00" title="August 30, 2014  5:13PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 30, 2014 5:29PM by Rickard.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>No it doesn't, it says "here is a list of things you might do in this game", not "here is why you should play this game".

It presents what the characters do, and in length what the players do. The Earthdawn example is only presenting dolls to play with but not why anyone would want to play with them. "Intriguing elfs, hateful orcs, dying t'skrangs, greedy humans and other critters that will change your everyday life."

These are the rest of the WHYs that exist in the game. Note that I also have a HOW in there, because I want to present the WHY first, followed up by the HOW and finish off with WHAT to play with. I did however combined WHATs and WHYs in the first example that talked about discovering Inca Pyramids.<br/><br/>Earthdawn has nothing of this. It has only a shopping list of what you can encounter in the game (WHATs) finished off with a sentence that I feel is mostly buzzwords open for large interpretation.\n<blockquote>"The Age of Legend". "Before science, before history, there was an Age of Legend..." and so on. Humanity has been huddling in underground kaers, Horrors reign on Earth, brave adventurers emerge to reclaim their world. Elfs, orcs, t'skrangs, humans and other wondrous critters. Strange creatures, unseen dangers, lost cities, long-forgotten treasures, indescribable wonders; a world of magic. "In this age of legend, heroes rekindle the glory days of past and become the legends of tomorrow. Join these brave souls and begin roleplaying in Earthdawn, the Age of Legend."</blockquote>\n"...become the legends of tomorrow." I dunno if it's a WHY (to play this game) or a WHAT (to play with). I could join them but I don't know what it means because it's buzzwords. "Do you want to have fun? Play this game". It says the same thing: nothing.<br/><br/><i>Roleplaying games are really bad, by tradition, at conveying why to play them</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437963">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437963/#Comment_437963" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-30T17:56:41+00:00" title="August 30, 2014  5:56PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 30, 2014 5:59PM by Rickard.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is a reason why roleplaying games are bad at conveying the purpose of the game, or why the game is fun in the first place. It's hard to put words on feelings. It's hard to tell why something is fun. You can track this back to the <i>limbic brain</i> - the part of the brain that is responsible for emotions and decision-making. Ever had a hard time describing a gut feeling? Well, that's because the <i>cortex brain</i> controls the language center and also the rational and analytic thinking. The last one is about the WHAT. The WHY and HOW, that is when it's about the feelings and decision-making.<br/><br/>The Earthdawn consists of WHATs, because it feels more natural to describe.<br/><br/>So if I take a different route to the two previous posts, how would I had written the backside of Earthdawn?\n<blockquote>Earthdawn offers its players a level of challenge and personal involvement unmatched by any other type of game. The players and gamemaster create together adventures to experience. The players through controlling the actions, or play the roles, of their characters and respond as they wish to the events of the plot.

A world that is yours to reclaim.</blockquote>\nThe text needs more work, but I want to show the idea of how to inform the reader of why to play this game, how to play this game, and what to use while playing this game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437965/#Comment_437965" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-30T19:41:21+00:00" title="August 30, 2014  7:41PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 30, 2014 8:08PM by David_Berg.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>There is a reason why roleplaying games are bad at conveying the purpose of the game, or why the game is fun in the first place.

RPGs already do too much of that for my taste as part of overlong flavor text.  I'm looking for the opposite -- to know what concrete play goals are supported by the game's design and rules.  If I know <i>that</i>, I'm happy to judge for myself how I feel about it and whether I'd find it fun.<br/><br/>Example: "Apples to Apples: the game of Hilarious Comparisons."  It's not a game that includes hilarious comparisons and who knows what else, and who knows what's most important.  The Hilarious Comparisons are The Point, period.  Why would I play?  Humor.  Can I get any more specific than that?  The humor of comparing.  If I look at the box for 2 seconds, I further refine that to "The humor of comparing nouns and concepts to adjectives."  Do I know what kind of nouns, concepts and adjectives?  No, not really, not yet.  I'll have to dig deeper to find out.  Which is good, because that's less important.<br/><br/>For an RPG which has a point beyond its flavor, leading off with nothing but flavor is akin to advertising Apples to Apples by saying "Provocative adjectives!  Culturally significant nouns!"<br/><br/>For Earthdawn, going by Eero's impression of the point, I'd say something like this:\n<blockquote>Earthdawn<br/>A classic roleplaying game of apocalyptic fantasy adventure<br/><br/>Tired of bringing your pencils, dice, and imaginations to the far future, middle ages, or Middle Earth?  Are you ready to bring your swords and spells and stealth to a world where civilization hides in caves from the Cthuloid Horrors that have devastated Earth?  A place where every adventure may bring back knowledge or resources your community desperately needs, but may also bring you face to face with unspeakable monsters and the destruction they have wrought?  If so, then give your gaming group a monstrous treat by introducing them to the world of Earthdawn.  This book includes tons of ideas for characters, places, and monsters.  Also included are rules for resolving adventuring tasks, which should be familiar to players of D&amp;D.  Choose from this toolkit according to what you and your players like best in adventure roleplay.</blockquote>\nThis might be a terrible sales pitch, I don't know.  But it's exactly the info I want to have, in the order I want to have it.  To me, Earthdawn is basically a setting book with all-purpose rules tweaked for that setting, and my group can make of it what we will.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437966/#Comment_437966" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-30T19:58:17+00:00" title="August 30, 2014  7:58PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are we talking about back-of-the-book text now?  That's a bit different.  But as often happens, we're still trying to answer questions for two or more groups of people with a single block of verbiage.  That's probably not going to work.  And I'm not even getting into different playstyles (yet).  But the primary distinction is between GMs (for games with GMs) and players.  <br/><br/>As a player I might want to read about feelings and fun and maybe some of the monsters I'll be facing or how awesome the world is, but players aren't usually the ones who buy the book.  GMs buy the book.  As a GM I would prefer to see a list of submechanics and a description of the game's technical approach and scope.  <br/><br/>Like when buying a toolset at the hardware store, I want the box to tell me not only how many pieces are inside, I want it to show me close-up pictures of some of the more unique tools included, specifics on some of the more unique functionality, and a general description of the types of jobs the tools in this toolset are optimized to handle.  That will help me decide whether this is the right toolset for my particular situation.<br/><br/>But obviously that's not what marketers care about.  They want me to buy the thing and figure out it's a bad match for me after my money's already spent. :-&gt;<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437967">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437967/#Comment_437967" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-30T20:10:19+00:00" title="August 30, 2014  8:10PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 30, 2014 8:15PM by David_Berg.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Vincent said that his games addressed to GMs sell better (or find a bigger audience, whatever) than his games addressed to players.<br/><br/>Perhaps the strategy of pitching the game in a general way is so that players will pick it up hoping to play, but they'll also be willing to GM when that's inevitably necessary?

Vincent actually writes a whole lot of paragraphs (scattered around the book) telling you how to use the game, although he keeps the idea of a "goal" at a pretty far distance.<br/><br/>AW is one of those games that intimidates and confuses a lot of people, even while they fall in love with it.  The book is oddly organized and it takes some time to become familiar with it.  I've seen dozens of posts on various forums where someone GUSHES about the game but hasn't figured out how to run it, or even admits to being literally <i>scared</i> of running it (and botching it).  Some of these people do indeed begin creating splats and hacks before ever getting a campaign going.  These are usually at least mildly-experienced GMs who see running a PbtA game almost as an auspicious rite of passage.  They are fascinated by the system itself, but they need to approach it obliquely, or in baby steps, in order to digest it.  For some, the best way to digest it is to build a hack.<br/><br/>Also of note: AW's blurb text is entirely world color.  Not a single mention of anything remotely mechanical.  It doesn't even say the word "game".<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437988/#Comment_437988" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-31T02:30:04+00:00" title="August 31, 2014  2:30AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>Earthdawn<br/>A classic roleplaying game of apocalyptic fantasy adventure<br/><br/><b>Tired of </b>bringing your pencils, dice, and<b> imaginations to the far future, middle ages, or Middle Earth?</b>  Are you ready to<b> bring your swords and spells and stealth to a world</b> where civilization hides in caves from the Cthuloid Horrors that have devastated Earth?  <b>A place where every adventure may bring back knowledge or resources your community desperately needs</b>, but may also <b>bring you face to face with unspeakable monsters</b> and the destruction they have wrought?

Gaining the recognition for it then becomes the actual, relevant, identified goal(s).<br/><br/>Around these parts, people have put a lot of thought about turning actual play practices into mechanics/official procedures. So why not do it with goals as well?<br/><br/>For example, from what I can tell, one of the actual, real people, goals of a whole lot of RP gaming is <i>to keep a smallish group of people meeting on a regular basis to play .</i><br/><br/>Sure, lots of variation on what exactly that means, but that's a driving goal. A real one. So, just looking at that, how do you identify it in text, name it, and officialize it?

My preference for immediacy and clarity means front cover or back cover.  <br/><br/>Others may assume or prefer within the body of the rules.<br/><br/>Since you mention it: RPGs aimed at people who may not already be familiar with RPGs might do well do say something about the goals of roleplaying; I haven't thought much about that yet, to be honest.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/komradebob">@komradebob</a>, my guess is that the level <i>immediately</i> below Real People Fun is the one to call out.  Apples to Apples calls itself "the game of Hilarious Comparisons", not "a game of Group Enjoyment".  It distinguishes the type of enjoyment (hilarity) and then refines that a littler further ("comparisons" both narrows it down and gives some hint at the "how" of gameplay).<br/><br/>So, I'd say that the goal of regular small group meetings can be referenced by an "ongoing", "long-term" or "campaign" keyword in the subtitle, but there needs to be more there too.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Rickard">@Rickard</a>, thanks!  I agree with you that the opportunities for action which play offers -- bring back needed knowledge or resources to your community, face unspeakable monsters -- are a key part of why to play.  Or, well, I mean, <i>if</i> that's the actual intent of Earthdawn.  I'm not sure if it is, which is why I added the last sentence about "use these tools the way you like best".
