We tend to discuss things, then go around the table, narrating one by one. After all, this is Fiasco: nobody will complain about you being co-operative.<br/><br/>Shameless plug, to save Jason doing it.

It's a play style thing; some people find the structure valuable, but either way it does no harm.<br/><br/>You know how black Aftermath skews physical and white skews mental? In the softer package, black skews social and white skews emotional.

We laughed about the poor sods final fates. But then in the book  it talks about using dice to state facts about the players aftermath in turn... that didn't make any sense to the people at the table, and was pretty much the only place we drifted away from the rules as written.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313329/#Comment_313329" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-19T06:38:09+00:00" title="February 19, 2011  6:38AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dionysus</cite>But when we got to reading our aftermath, each player read them out aloud, and immediately everyone knew what would happen to the character in the fiction to meet that aftermath.</blockquote>\nYeah, this is what I was responding to. When that happens it does no harm to skip the montage, although I often try to catch this before it happens and play the montage anyway, even if everybody just <i>knows </i>what happens, because the results are often informed by other people's choices and it can be surprising and fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_319748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/doho123" title="doho123"><img alt="doho123" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/doho123">doho123</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319748/#Comment_319748" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-08T20:21:41+00:00" title="April  8, 2011  8:21PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know if anyone is interested in this, but.....<br/><br/>Over spring break, we took the kids to an indoor water park for a few days.
