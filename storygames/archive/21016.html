It was very intuitive for her, though; she jumped right into, "Oh, well, this is what my character is feeling as they're doing this." Pretty soon I got into it, too: it made situating yourself in the fiction a very automatic thing, rather than something you could forget about as you start considering the tactical situation you're in.<br/><br/>1a) I actually think this is a really cool approach to PbtA, and I feel like if the game takes off more we'll see a lot more PbTA derivatives inspired by this piece of technique. <br/><br/>2) It is not a cyberpunk game. I don't think it was intended to be lies-for-marketing, but it's just ... not. It's a transhumanist game, or a post-humanist game, or some sort of far-flung science fiction game that centers on the human experience, but not cyberpunk. Accordingly, the setting is *extremely* wide open. This game runs Charles Stross' Accelerando about as well (or, honestly, better) as it does Neuromancer. <br/><br/>2a) It's really not cyberpunk. My wife didn't grow up on Shadowrun or CP2020, so our story didn't tilt that way, but honestly... this *game* just doesn't tilt that way. I don't think you could run a frictionless Shadowrun or CP2020 game with The Veil unless you just run it gonzo-ish. <br/><br/>2b) It's not even really science fiction. There are several playbooks that go "so, this playbook can do magic. Or maybe it's nanotech! Who gives a fuck, just roll with it." The Wayward, for instance, is basically a druid. And it seems to work, honestly, because like I said: not cyberpunk. This game's not focused on tech at all: it's focused on the human relationship with tech and its consequences. That worked for my wife and I, when she just went, "so, humans have totally and completely and utterly ruined the fucking environment. We're on the cusp of absolute annihilation. And ... now there's this Wayward." Obviously part of me was extremely annoyed by "oh, Tree Jesus," but... why not? The Wayward is well built to force a thematic reflection of the relationship between human technological progress and the cost to the environment, and what it takes to restore that. <br/><br/>2c) That makes it both "easy" and "super fucking hard" to put forward threats/stories/etc. The playbooks immediately drill down on themes to address, but it lends itself to such a wide-open setting (uploaded AI minds living on computronium Matroshka dyson spheres? Sure. Post-apocalyptic wasteland of ecologically-demolished barrens? Sure. Near-future? Sure. 50 centuries from now? Why not) that the setting can easily be ... just too wide open to give you anything to grab onto. <br/><br/>For that matter, some of the playbooks don't necessarily fit into the same tech setting easily at all. e.g., the Onomastic has magic home base teleportation powers. If you don't want your game to be magic, it's hand-wavey nanotech. So if the Onomastic is in your game, your tech level is at least sufficient to support spontaneous teleportation. As opposed to the Executive, who is palpably a member of a peri-Scarcity economy; no one is contemplating a post-scarcity Singularity-type setting with the guy who's moonlighting protection details to keep ahead of broke. <br/><br/>2d) There is absolutely no other game that I've come across that does what this game does. Period. Buy it, play it, and then maybe love it or never play it again - but you will have had to buy it and play it.<br/><br/>3) It seemed to work well 1-on-1. I have a feeling it will generally work best in small groups, with a lot of PbTA-ish "take 2 players at a time" framing. Each playbook isn't so much your relationship (Masks), your immaturity (Monsterhearts), etc. Each playbook is a particular theme/relationship dynamic between humans and technology. There are only so many themes you can explore at the same time before the game becomes incoherent, I think. By the same token, I don't think this game has any longevity for campaign play: pick your playbooks, your themes, what questions about humanity that intersection of themes sheds a light on, and play to focus as much light as possible through that lens. <br/><br/>4) The editing is kind of shit. The author is responsive on G+ to highlighted mistakes / differences of opinion on the writing, but it just does not read like a final product. I'm really rather glad I didn't buy the premium deadtree version of this: as gorgeous as the art is, I'd be pissed if I paid premium for something that reads like this.<br/><br/>5) There were too many moves that were of the "pick 2 bad things not to happen out of a list of 4"-type. Yes, complications snowballing is the beating heart of PbtA, but this just ends up turning their successes into failures. In AW, I'd nearly guarantee that the one they didn't pick ended up happening. Here, I used it as permission to use one or two of the results they didn't pick - but I didn't push all of them. It would just be too punishing.<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461202/#Comment_461202" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-20T04:08:10+00:00" title="March 20, 2017  4:08AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 20, 2017 4:09AM by Jeff_B_Slater.">edited March 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I've run a 1-on-1 with my wife; my first run at the Veil (though I've run a shit-ton of Sprawl), and one of her first runs at RPGs altogether (only previous experience was Quiet Year).<br/><br/>Key things I noticed:<br/><br/>1) The emphasis on emotional states rather than stats was super weird for me, I guess, coming from a background of... well, all the other RPGs.

Thank you so much, miedvied :-)  The emphasis on emotional states seems really cool and original; to bad the rest of the game isn't a little tighter... maybe, as you say, the emotional states thing will catch on with other PbtA games... The game certainly seems interesting enough to check out :-) thanks so much :-) <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20Nicol" title="Jonathan Nicol"><img alt="Jonathan Nicol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20Nicol">Jonathan Nicol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461218/#Comment_461218" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-21T01:31:52+00:00" title="March 21, 2017  1:31AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm still debating on when I will pick up The Veil.

It has real flaws (and I feel like a major asshole saying that in front of the author.) I think it's *also* one of the most important PbTA derivatives to date, in terms of mechanic and thematic playbooks, and anyone who even half-fancies PbtA design owes it to themselves to get the book. <br/><br/>In terms of producing Genre play, what we ordinarily think of as the core competency of PbtA, it seems to me that it sits on the opposite end of the spectrum from MH or Urban Shadows. Those books play genre jams flawlessly and easily with low-or-no prep, but at the same time, I think of them as adroit PbtA reskins, not really innovations. AW is very supportive of having players who aren't on the ball that day. They don't have to "bring it" - the mechanics will make sure you're having a snowballing apocalypse romp. The game is genre-aware, focused, and does most of the heavy lifting of keeping you on-task. That said, if you want to do more than that, and hit some more nuanced themes... that's on you. I feel like that's generally what you see in PbtA games: Urban Shadows is so focused that, whether you like it or not, you're going to be creating WoD-style urban politics without trying to. It's built-in.<br/><br/>I don't think the Veil naturally produces genre play the way we normally think of PbtA games as doing - maybe (at this point, I've run it all of twice; I reserve the right to change my opinion about this as we play it more). The playbooks seem to capture transhumanist/post-cyberpunk sub-genres, but I can't say the game *itself* puts forward a single, honed genre: depending on which set of playbooks you choose, you're going to end up with a different post-cyberpunk vision, not just a different lens for the same genre. The Executive and the Apparatus (a newly emotionally aware machine) will get you into something Bladerunner-ish; the Dying and the Empath will produce something vastly different. The former seem a lot more hard sci-fi; the empath comes with the intro line "Whether this ability is uncanny or futuristic, or explained at all is up to you, but as with all playbooks it brings assumptions about the setting. Are these magical abilities or are their explanations needed at all?" A line I think does a lot to highlight about just how wide-open the Veil is. You have to be thoughtful about your setting, about your choice of playbooks, about how they intersect, and what questions tie together closely enough for a single game to support those playbooks. <br/><br/>Where I noticed the problem standing out for me: the MC advice basically says, "A threat is a notable NPC within the fiction that is going to make a difference in the status quo ... what is already established or what is known b the protaongists and players, right now. A threat aims to change that - their personality, responsibilities, allegiances, power, realtionships, will all lead to the ... change." Standard PbtA threat write-up, no problem. The issue, like I said, is that the Veil seems so wide-open, that establishing a coherent "status quo" - especially one relevant to characters whose themes largely revolve around their internal conflicts and relationships to the world, rather than external needs (e.g., about their relationship to the ecology of their home land, vs.  I need bullets + bread) - isn't all that straightforward. A game with a Seeker (monk-type seeker of enlightenment) and an Honorbound (honor-enforcing ninja) is distinct from a game with an Empath (exactly what it sounds like) and an Apparatus (the self-aware machine) in a much more fundamental way than a game of AW with a Gunlugger and Chopper is distinct from one with a Battlebabe and Hardholder. <br/><br/>(I think the intersection bit is the bigger problem, by the way. I could cater to my wife's playbook themes easily 1-on-1; but where every playbook is its own manga, finding a coherent unifying vision for these different playbooks seems non-trivial. We've been 1-on-1 though, so I'm speaking speculatively here.)<br/><br/>Honestly, it's hard to call it a strength or a flaw. If you're the sort of person who thinks Apocalypse Engine games *should* roll easy genre play as long as you know the basic moves and have some playbooks on hand, then it's a flaw. If you're comfortable saying "this is a step back from that approach, and puts an interesting toolbox in your hands if you're going to step up and use those tools," then it's a strength.<br/><br/>I haven't played it enough to comment yet on whether the moves need changing in order to accomodate good play. When we played, we stuck to everything as written, but I chose to keep a light hand on my permission to use hard moves as compared to ... well, pretty much any other PbtA game. <br/><br/>I feel bad for the bluntness of my comment about the editing. I think the author really means well, and like I said, is responsive to comments about it on G+, but I was also being honest about my perspective on it, if excessively curt. (e.g., I hit ctrl-F for a line about magic in the pdf. First result I came across was the empath. "Are these magical abilities or are their explanations needed at all?" Should be 'there', not 'their'). In some places it's trivial (like the there/their I just quoted); in others, it impacts understanding. Sorry, soyosauce.<br/><br/>It's a lot easier to discuss complexities and flaws than it is strengths. The former give rise to words, the latter to "oh, it's cool." And my opinions will doubtless evolve as I run more sessions of it. But the tl;dr here is: <br/><br/>(1) When I saw emotional stats, I kinda went ... eh. Then I saw it in play, and now I think there's a bunch of game designers (not all of them; it really must be appropriate to the game) that should be looking at their game and saying "Oh. Why the fuck didn't I think of that? That's SO MUCH BETTER." I'm not sure if future games should steal it outright or work on fusions, but you know how people looked at BitD and went "Oh, that approach to flashbacks and prep. That's the future of PbtA." That's how I felt seeing the emotion stats in action. It's more impressive in action with a new player than it is on paper.<br/><br/>(2) I believe you need to bring your genre decisions in with you, and play on the ball. If Urban Shadows poops out WoD political play without trying, and AW gives you murder hobo-ing in the apocalypse as an emergent propery, The Veil is not that sort of "follow the rules, get the genre experience"-type game, IME. If anyone's had some more experience with it and finds differently, I'm all ears to it, though. I don't mean to assert that our experience was the defining experience.<br/><br/>(3) I have yet to see a game manage to pack an entire major theme artfully into a single playbook the way Veil does, and then do it over and over for each playbook. It really packages a lot very elegantly.<br/><br/>(4) My wife and I had a good time.

It has real flaws (and I feel like a major asshole saying that in front of the author.) I think it's *also* one of the most important PbTA derivatives to date, in terms of mechanic and thematic playbooks, and anyone who even half-fancies PbtA design owes it to themselves to get the book. <br/><br/>In terms of producing Genre play, what we ordinarily think of as the core competency of PbtA, it seems to me that it sits on the opposite end of the spectrum from MH or Urban Shadows. Those books play genre jams flawlessly and easily with low-or-no prep, but at the same time, I think of them as adroit PbtA reskins, not really innovations. AW is very supportive of having players who aren't on the ball that day. They don't have to "bring it" - the mechanics will make sure you're having a snowballing apocalypse romp. The game is genre-aware, focused, and does most of the heavy lifting of keeping you on-task. That said, if you want to do more than that, and hit some more nuanced themes... that's on you. I feel like that's generally what you see in PbtA games: Urban Shadows is so focused that, whether you like it or not, you're going to be creating WoD-style urban politics without trying to. It's built-in.<br/><br/>I don't think the Veil naturally produces genre play the way we normally think of PbtA games as doing - maybe (at this point, I've run it all of twice; I reserve the right to change my opinion about this as we play it more). The playbooks seem to capture transhumanist/post-cyberpunk sub-genres, but I can't say the game *itself* puts forward a single, honed genre: depending on which set of playbooks you choose, you're going to end up with a different post-cyberpunk vision, not just a different lens for the same genre. The Executive and the Apparatus (a newly emotionally aware machine) will get you into something Bladerunner-ish; the Dying and the Empath will produce something vastly different. The former seem a lot more hard sci-fi; the empath comes with the intro line "Whether this ability is uncanny or futuristic, or explained at all is up to you, but as with all playbooks it brings assumptions about the setting. Are these magical abilities or are their explanations needed at all?" A line I think does a lot to highlight about just how wide-open the Veil is.

I'm absolutely getting the game, I don't think your  take on it is negative at all. Would  you rather have the same old thing? Or game with significant invitations and some issues to work around.  The design seems truly innovative and I'm very excited to purchase it and take a look at it :-) Again, thank you so much for all the work you did with these thoughtful and thorough write ups, miedvied.

But, either way, it's not a super-clear sentence, as our diverging readings show.)<br/><br/>I'd like to hear more about this "emotional state" design, and how it impacts play. When I read "play is about emotional states", I thought that it sounded like an interesting way to bring *how a character is feeling* into the forefront, which is something I've long thought should and could be done. That's very interesting to explore! However, then, later in this thread there are comments that your *stats* are based on emotions... does that mean that your character's "emotions" are static?<br/><br/>How does it work?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461240/#Comment_461240" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-21T22:51:19+00:00" title="March 21, 2017 10:51PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want to know more about emotional state systems too!<br/><br/>Is it like:<br/><br/>"You did a thing that requires a roll.  Okay, what are you feeling?  Which of these 5 emotions is it closest to?  Okay, roll that, then."  This sounds great to me as a check-in, but arbitrary or weird as a determinant of action success.  I'm good at killing or sleuthing or sneaking or anything in the world as long as I do it while Wistful?  Sounds a bit much like In a Wicked Age, where I found the "for myself"/"for others" and similar distinctions played out as thematic, from-above descriptions of characters' story niches rather than anything keeping me in-character.  <br/><br/>I had better luck with Smallville's "add a die for a relationship that has a bearing on this", where everything you do winds up being partly to spite or help or impress another character.  I guess the PbtA equivalent would be that when you roll Hard to get violent, you get +1 or -1 or something based on whether you're Angry or Scared.<br/><br/>Or:<br/><br/>"The only things that require rolls are things which require certain emotions.  You can only deal Harm when Angry, you can only heal while Compassionate, you can only dodge while Frantic, etc.  If you were planning to deal Harm but you weren't Angry, you either abort or give a feeble effort and fail."<br/><br/>Or something else?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soyosauce" title="soyosauce"><img alt="soyosauce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soyosauce">soyosauce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461242/#Comment_461242" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-22T02:58:04+00:00" title="March 22, 2017  2:58AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 22, 2017 3:14AM by soyosauce.">edited March 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No problem Jeff, I did write some stuff to be intentionally subjective but that being said it was the first thing I've written and first design so I know there's some rough edges and flaws there. Personally I'm biased probably, I think there's a lot of value in the game but of course sentences in there where it impacts understanding I agree that is a problem that needs to be corrected. I did hire a professional editor but seems like some stuff was missed. <br/><br/>And those kinds of things I would like to see so I can edit the PDF and then should I be lucky enough to sell the first print run the second will have those changes. <br/><br/>I'm really happy people are enjoying it! I just find the emotion behind the action more interesting since we are already telling each other how we do the things. May as well clarify since we are driving at making some kind of visual media, what these players are feeling so we get a better shot/picture, etc. For me it's just how I grok stuff easier and I find it more intuitive. It's also really interesting what modifiers are placed in each state for the MC as they can really drive the fiction towards any specific emotion they'd like ultimately, especially with The Veil allowing for whatever visuals and stimulus they can think of.  <br/><br/>Essentially whenever a move is triggered they're using a modifier from an emotional state. Meaning anytime a move is triggered they could be rolling with a different state, depending on what's going on in the fiction. There are emotion spikes that represent how keenly that emotion is being felt by the character and they can be mitigated by using the opposite emotion. Otherwise they accrue and the MC gives them a condition when they're maxed out that changes their modifiers and are given a decision that ties into the emotion that is "spiked out". So for games where you're not rolling much you are still adding emotional baggage throughout, how often that triggers or not is up to them. If power gamers munchkin it they have to give a dynamic performance anyways to keep using emotions that are the opposite of the other so as to never spike out. Or, if they want to only use their best modifier they'll spike it out and be given a condition that focuses on that emotions at it's most intense for it anyways. Either way you're getting a clearer picture in the fiction in my mind. I have had some players not grok it initially but generally I've found the people who say they would just game it end up giving the most dynamic performance just by attempting to game it, so I'm fine with that. Ultimately if people want to not play in the spirit of the game I can't do much about it anyhow. But that would be the most prevalent counter argument for states I've seen raised. <br/><br/>If you're always wistful while sneaking I'd say you're just kind of choosing to provide a boring fiction right and the most interesting scenes in moves are ones where the emotions are painted into the scene. I get more from it then someone saying, "OK, I am hard as fuck with +2, so here's the result." <br/><br/>It also allows people to touch on the emotion in the scene as deeply as they like, if it's the kind of play the like. They could just say we see Jack angry as fuck on camera as the hammer snaps back on the rifle and that would be fine, but there's movement there for people to dig a little deeper if they like as well. <br/><br/>Hopefully that answers the questions for you. And I appreciate the criticism so no need to feel bad for having an opinion, especially if it's something that impedes people from understanding the text as it is. Very much appreciated your breakdown even where I disagree about genre and such, thanks for sharing that with me/us! Very thankful for the kind words about the system as well, means a lot to hear stuff like that, so thank you again. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/miedvied" title="miedvied"><img alt="miedvied" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/miedvied">miedvied</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461246/#Comment_461246" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-22T04:03:26+00:00" title="March 22, 2017  4:03AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 22, 2017 4:10AM by miedvied.">edited March 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">@Jeff_B_Slater</a><br/><br/>It's precisely as you said: about bringing the characters' emotions to the forefront.<br/><br/>So, moves roll 2d6 + State, where State is the emotional state that the PC is in when they trigger the move. Unlike, say, Headspace, it means that you're not firing off your pistol with Anger every time: you roll with whichever emotion you're feeling when you pull the trigger. The book actually leads with an emotion wheel to guide players in relating a wide variety of emotions to the six core emotions (your stats). So you can have angry at +2, and sad at +1, and you're narrating the character's emotional state - and why they feel that way - when you're using the corresponding emotion as their +State.<br/><br/>As you use each emotion, you increment a counter. If you max out on a given emotional state, it becomes +1 (regardless of the base stat), and all others become -2.  You can address this ratchet by using the opposing emotion, which will increment up one, and decrement the opposed. <br/><br/>For example: you attack with +Scared, and scared gets 1 spike. You might then find a reason to get into a Powerful state of mind, which would add 1 spike to Powerful, and take one off Scared. <br/><br/>The emotional opposition-pairings are predetermined by the game, though I think it could be an interesting bit of characterization to customize how your character's emotions are paired up in opposites.<br/><br/>If you've maxed out the counter for an emotion and gone into the emotional fit, you're stuck there until you use a special move for getting out of it (which can either let you slowly ride back down on the triggering emotion, or get out of it by using one of the other emotional states at -2).<br/><br/>This is manipulated further by other game mechanics (e.g., there's an empath that gets to move around these emotional spikes for themselves and others).<br/><br/>So, what we saw in play was this:<br/><br/>My wife, largely a newbie to RPGs, took each Move more seriously, because each one required some emotional thought. It also kept her grounded in the PC, because it wasn't "Oh, I fucking knock his lights out for talking back to me," it's, "I feel Mad at how he's talking to me - it reminds me of how my dad used to talk to my mom. I fucking punch him in the face." It made the immersion a naturally emergent part of the game play, rather than a bit of make-believe you stick on top of tactical minis. <br/><br/>She also didn't *want* this level of introspection for every move, so we tended to zoom out with moves more. You know how Vx recommends zooming in and out with the scope of moves in AW, between more task resolution ("I seize his gun") and conflict resolution ("I seize the bunker")? You can't give little memory snippets with every f'n punch in a fight, so we had to lean towards conflict resolution scale for our moves. That suited us fine, though; she wasn't interested in fight choreography. <br/><br/>We could have gone the other way and just had less emotional description, but we didn't: it wasn't something we explicitly discussed at the table. I asked her about this as I wrote this response up, and she said that it just felt appropriate to give actual descriptions, both because of what was modeled in the book, and because, paraphrasing just slightly, "If all I have to say is Hulk Angry, Hulk Smash, why would I bother saying anything besides Hulk Smash"? On my end, I naturally swayed to zooming out on moves, to ease up on how much she had to elaborate - I didn't want the well to run dry. This is something that might have benefited from us explicitly talking about it, and maybe the book should call this out as something to consider explicitly as well (or maybe the book does call it out, and I overlooked it).<br/><br/>The catharsis mechanic (called alleviate in the book) was a bit mixed. I think it might have gone awry if I focused on task resolution, but since that didn't happen, and the mechanic *did* lean us towards good immersion, my wife focused on actually having a well-rounded character. The emotion wheel helped, since it suggested emotions that weren't immediately intuitive for using with the various stats (we ended up keeping a print-out of the wheel on the tabletop). <br/><br/>What ended up - for us, at least - happening is that when an emotion did spike out, (1) having to use the same emotion over and over again to ride down was both a disadvantage (since it was a +1 on a stat where she normally had a +2), or mechanically neutral but boring as fuck (the other stat where it landed she had a +1, so that's a wash, but she didn't want to use it over and over). So, the incentive was definitely there to end the emotional spike, or prevent it from occurring to begin with, but it wasn't a *big* incentive. So she ended up trying to abort early by using another emotion at -2: in short, creating a big ol' mess of complications (I didn't hold back on hard moves with these) when getting catharsis'd. <br/><br/>I feel like going hard with my MC move added to the effect: it seemed like otherwise, the whole spike+catharsis thing was anti-climactic: you lean as hard as you want on an emotion, and then you (probably) fail one roll. It loomed larger in the mind than it did mechanically - which was fine for my new player wife, but I think the sting would fade quickly with a group that was more comfortable reading the rules and going, "oh, that's not a big deal." It also just seemed like too small an ending to something that built up for a while; she'd taken her emotional spikes and mitigation seriously, and I felt like I wouldn't be "Being a Fan" if I responded to the loss of control with a lame, run-of-the-mill hard move when she (inevitably) missed with her -2. So I didn't hold back there, and let her really feel the spiraling-out-of-control of being emotionally unbalanced. I don't know if that was the designer's intention.<br/><br/>During our first hour of play, we'd actually misread the rules: each use of an emotion incremented the State itself by 1, until you hit 4, and went into that state of +1/-2's. I don't know why I misread it that way: maybe just deciding, "oh, the emotion is the stat, and the emotion is spiking. (and knowing PbtA, the stat won't go over +3)." <br/><br/>So if you had +1 in Sad, and used it to Lift the Veil, your Sad would go up to +2. If you used it again and it hit +3, you were still good. But one more time, and you'd lock it into +1, everything else into -2's, etc. This was way more volatile, but also really fun in its own way, and something that might be worth exploring in a hack, custom playbook, or different game. I'd have to play a few more sessions the regular way and getting a better feel for the system before I try doing this on purpose to contrast and compare. <br/><br/>The results were this:<br/>(1) My wife was super immersed<br/>(2) She gave a shit about her character's emotional balance/health<br/>(3) We leaned towards conflict resolution over task resolution for the scale of moves<br/><br/>3 is arguably not a win. Smaller scale moves have a place, too. I think as we play we'll settle on a rhythm for this: maybe zoomed out moves get more emotional elaboration, and zoomed in moves can suffice with an "She's pissed as hell and slugs the drone." Or whatever she feels like saying whenever she feels like saying it. Certainly the rules support going easy on the descriptions, and it's something we have to sort out in play. But as for 1 and 2... that was just great. The gameplay just naturally went in the opposite direction from Murder Hobo-ing. I could see this kind of system, or an adaptation of it (or an adaptation of our screw-up) being a fantastic future direction for something like Monsterhearts, for instance. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461285/#Comment_461285" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-22T22:06:00+00:00" title="March 22, 2017 10:06PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 22, 2017 10:06PM by David_Berg.">edited March 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>generally I've found the people who say they would just game it end up giving the most dynamic performance just by attempting to game it<br/></blockquote>Whoa!

So you can see what you're putting into your scenes, what their perception is vs how you want them to be perceived. <br/><br/>Sure, there's a danger of that if they don't want to engage with making your fiction as interesting as possible, especially in the vein of framing scenes with making a movie in mind. Ultimately how much you hit on a particular emotion and what that looks like may need some prompting from the other players and MC, but chances are if they don't care and just say "sure, whatever I'm sad. I shoot them." They probably aren't interested in using the emotion states to help make a fiction in a way stats don't, they aren't going to be playing the game anyways. A part of PbtA is asking questions like crazy, a normal question would be asking why they're angry or sad. If that results in a more rich fiction...which clarifying the fiction should do, that's how you sell the shifts in emotions. Through them seeing their emotion spikes, wanting to provide a dynamic performance that isn't bland, only focusing on one emotion. And appealing to the gameable nature of the emotional states that results in being dynamic anyways. <br/><br/>From what I've seen the impact is just an overall better fiction and also prescribing actions with emotions put people in a headspace that discourages detachment and bland characters defined only by their actions and never having a human nature at play. Is it the same roll when you roll hard to kill someone as it is when I ask you how you feel when you pull the trigger, and why? You also constantly have emotional baggage staring you in the face that reminds you of what's happened. <br/><br/>If you're worried about people just wanting to munchkin it sure, it's something they can do. But their character is going to be super boring and the fiction will probably not make sense. Ultimately I rely on people engaging with mechanics in the spirit of the games to focus them on shifting emotions appropriately. Giving them a tool to help them roleplay instead of a mechanic that forces them to do so.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461511/#Comment_461511" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-29T03:56:39+00:00" title="March 29, 2017  3:56AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see!

There's no mechanical or procedural reinforcement of that behavior specific, it's all emergent from when people explain what their state is when a roll takes places there is a natural tendency to elaborate in order to validate your choice. Especially if it's something that may require context like, "I'm peaceful when I pull the trigger." A natural question is well, why? But generally you don't need to ask it, they go into detail all by themselves. But with the framework of every scene being around emotional states for any important movements in the fiction the questions the MC typically tends to ask are centered around those, which tend to draw the scenes to places like that. If they don't play honestly they still need to justify what the state is that they're rolling so people come up with some interesting stuff.
