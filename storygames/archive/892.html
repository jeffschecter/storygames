                    In this thread http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=862&amp;page=1#Item_0 about designing a gateway game, TonyLB makes what I thought was the most insightful comment of the whole thread:<br/>
<br/>
"D&amp;D is the gateway game that it is because people *want* to GM it for their friends. They want to do it enough to convince said friends to play."<br/>
<br/>
I've finished a GMless game and I play it exlusively with non-roleplaying friends. I'm the recruiter for my own system. If I hadn't done all the rules, text, art*, layout, other headache stuff for it, would I still be motivated to recruit?<br/>
<br/>
I'm play testing my second GMless game. Again, if it wasn't my game would I still be recruiting for it?<br/>
<br/>
I play Universalis maybe once every 3 months. When I first got the game I was playing it 3 times a week. When I first started playing it was so much fun teaching the people the game, seeing the light bulb switch on above their heads, shaping play until they were ready to dive in and make the game their own. Is it possible that I recruited for this GMless game because it let me GMed exactly the way I enjoyed most? Now my friends all know how to play it, they don't need a GM any more.<br/>
<br/>
Disclaimer: The three games above are all amazing fun. The only way for me to enjoy that fun is to recruit other people to play them with me. Please take all that for granted - I'm interested in the other sneaky and shadowy reasons for why Im recruiting for GMless games. For why I'm doing a GM task (recruiting/facilitating) for games that claim not to need them.<br/>
<br/>
I don't have a point to make through this thread. I just want to listen. Here's who I'd love to hear from in this thread:<br/>
<br/>
1) You play/have played a GMless game<br/>
2) You have recruited people to play it with you.**<br/>
3) You can talk about why.<br/>
<br/>
Here's when you're off topic<br/>
<br/>
1) Talking about "what is a GM and what do they do"<br/>
2) Explaining to me that I can't play by myself, that's why I recuit<br/>
3) If you haven't actually really truly played and recruited for a GMless game.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
* When I say "art" read "some drawings I drew"<br/>
**Playing online is cool to talk about because you guys are *really* recruiting - actually going out and making contact with people you don't otherwise know.                </div>

                            I have played Capes.  I have recruited people to play it with me.  I wanted to find out if it was as much fun without Tony as it was with Tony.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn't.  But then, every game is less fun without Tony.<br/>
<br/>
How about games with partially distributed GM responsibilities, like Primetime Adventures?                        </div>

                            I've played GM-less lots, and my Durham3 group is often GM-minimal.  <br/><br/>The D&amp;D GM as recruiter thing has, at its core, excitement and a desire to share your creative output.  GM-less play opens the table up for everyone's creative output, so the excitement piece is all the recruiter needs.                        </div>

                            Hi Jason! Tell us the title for the GMless game, it will help keep the thread on track if anyone else joins it.<br/>
<br/>
As well as Universalis, Shoujo Story and Samurai Badges are two I play (the two I mentioned as my own designs in my first post).<br/>
<br/>
Here's the question - it's not one of those sneaky questions where I ask it and then wait for you to answer and then I pounce on your answer and make my point. I'm just genuinely interested to know - as well as the fun of playing the game did you get any "extra" fun that the other people you recruited weren't privy too?<br/>
<br/>
Like with Universalis the game is sheer fun to play for everyone involved. But I also get a secret kick out of it that the people I'm recruiting aren't privy to. I get to enjoy "teaching the people the game, seeing the light bulb switch on above their heads, shaping play until they were ready to dive in and make the game their own"<br/>
<br/>
As recruiter in your Gmless game, did you get any extra fun on the side you can talk about?                        </div>

                            Hi Vaxalon. <br/>
<br/>
Yeah Prime Time Adventures is a nice example because the reason I ran it was because it looked like such a joy to GM (and it really was). I got a group of people together so that I could have fun GMing it for them.<br/>
<br/>
The thing is Universalis and my own two gmless games don't have that going for them. It doesn't make any special promises of fun just for running it. Everybody plays the same game under the same rules, so everyone is promised the same type of fun. What is it that makes people jump up and say "I want to run this game!" when its a GMless game? That's why I wanted to just hear about GMless games.                        </div>

                            The GM-less game I've played the most is The Roach, so as far as analysis goes that's useless, since I'm an unrepentant Roach flack.  <br/><br/>I've also played Polaris, as well as AG&amp;G (cough), Face of Angels (cough cough), and PTA, which requires a Producer but operates on a different dynamic from traditional GMing.  I think that in some groups, the GM role just gets smaller and smaller anyway over time.<br/><br/>I can appreciate the "secret kick" thing, Tony, although most of the people I play with are totally down with new modes of play.                        </div>

<blockquote> write GMless games 'cos I don't really like GMing, and hate prep. </blockquote>
Thanks PoDly, yeah me too, also I'm just not that good at GMing, I find it very hard.<br/><br/>It sounds like you're having amazing fun in play, would you say it was also fun simply being able to share your designs with your friends? Is there anything which made for extra fun for you aside from the ffact you were roleplaying great games with great people?<br/><br/>Im after any little incentives to run a GMless game. You don't get to build an ingenious dungeon, or thrilling world, and then expose it to your frineds and see it in play. So what other little incentives are there to go out and recruit people to play? (Apart from the sheer fun of roleplaying)<br/><br/>Maybe in my texts I should be highlighting that there's no prep as a really good thing?                        </div>

                            Definitely.  Low prep is great.  Also, I really enjoy what happens when everyone contributes equally - you've got the entire group's brain-power working on bringing the game to life, rather than the offer/consume power differential that can emerge in the traditional GM/player mode.                        </div>

<p>Counterpoint - I'm playing in a GMed HeroQuest game and the <em>vast majority</em> of my participation so far has been building the world my character comes from.</p>
<p>I find sometimes it's a lot of fun to take a low-prep game and sneak around and do some surprise prep there. It gives everyone a little extra stuff to hook into the game.</p>

<p><em>Capes</em> benefits from extensive prep-work and rewards the person who did the prep.  There's a whole chapter dedicated to prepping plot-threads, and how to direct your efforts to create the best effect.  I'm not sure anyone ever reads it, but it's there.</p>
<p>A GM-less game that <em>required</em> significant prep would be interesting.  Would it require that prep-work of everyone, or just certain people?  I'm not sure there are many game groups with enough enthusiasm to require extensive prep from everyone.</p>

                            Any game benefits from prep, even Chess.  Exactly what form that prep takes changes from game to game.<br/>
<br/>
I would think that a high-prep game would be one where the lack of prep is particularly damaging.                        </div>

Did you have particular play experiences or a kind of philosophy that made you think that way and write it up in the text?<br/><br/>Shreyas Sampat: <code>"Counterpoint - I'm playing in a GMed HeroQuest game and the vast majority of my participation so far has been building the world my character comes from.

It gives everyone a little extra stuff to hook into the game."</code><br/><br/>Thanks Shreyas. Do you have experiences of GMless games you could talk about? Particularly ones where you did all the leg work recruiting the group to play this weird game you wanted to try.                        </div>

<p>Well, I had lots of little play experiences where, when nobody was offering any direction, play stagnated and people got (frankly) a little silly.  And then I had lots of play experiences where I went into the game with an idea in mind ("Remember honey!  Dinner at the Jensens at nine o'clock, and don't you dare be late!"  ... he's gonna be late) and whether that idea came to pass or didn't, it made the game better by providing structure.</p>
<p>Sometimes people embrace my ideas ("My guy should totally be late!  His family life is going straight to hell because of all the secret heroics") and sometimes they reject them ("No, see, it's not about meeting with the Jensens, it's about fighting the forces of evil!  Forget the Jensens, we will never speak of them again.")  But either way they aren't staring at (metaphorically) a blank, featureless plain, wondering which way they should drive.  The prepared story elements are landmarks.  Drive toward them, drive away from them, drive around them ... anything.  You've got something to orient yourself to.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, prep-work in a GM-less game serves much the same purpose that player flags serve in a GMed game.  They give people an idea of what directions it's worth guiding the game toward.</p>

<p>In case you're not believing the author of the game, I'll chime in and agree the <em>Capes</em> text explains the notion of thinking up clever direction YOU can attempt to take the game in, coming up with new character and themes you know will grab the other players by the collar. And you can think up creative entries for all twelve powers with being hurried. It's maybe more easily compared to building a new <em>Magic</em> deck for a regular group of the same players. It's totally prep activity, and moreso than chess because you're doing creative-type stuff to drop into the SIS, just like a GM and his oh-so-original NPC he took hours to build.</p>

Universalis - I bought it out of curiosity, and ran it a few times to see what it was like. Then, one of the people I played it with ran it with another group, because he liked it.<br/>
<br/>
Capes - I got a review copy (IIRC), and knew I had no chance in hell of writing a fair review without playing it. I got a group together, played it, didn't enjoy the play experience, wrote the review. Later, I got a different group together to see if I could play it and have fun with it.<br/>
<br/>
Under the Bed - Bought it out of curiosity &amp; everyone's raving about it, tried it twice to see what it was like. <br/>
<br/>
All in all, I find I treat these games a bit like board games - they're intriguing, I get a group together and play the games to see how they work, and if I like them, or just need to figure something out about the rules, I play them again.                        </div>

                            Making a thrilling world is actually easier without a GM because everyone's putting in stuff that's thrilling to them.

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Vaxalon</cite>Tony, can you name a GMless high-prep game?</blockquote>
Hmmm, it sounds a little like my experience with Shock, but the prep acutally is folded into the game, so it's not like everyone is at home writing stuff to bring to the table.<br/><br/>Ben's ideas behind <b>Corpus</b>, which I will probably steal at some point, could be made into a high prep GMless game...                        </div>

                            I recruit for GM-less games because I like giving pleasure to others.  Not only does it make me look cool to know about such cool games, it also means that the people I introduce the game to appreciate me, as a human being, more because of it.  Also it means that I have a larger pool of people to play with.  Also I'm sure to find someone who will appreciate even my most twisted and bizarre ideas if I just keep trying enough different folks.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            Well for Universalis obviously I recruit because I like the idea of people playing a game I created (was briefly for the profits as well). But I've recruited for other GM-less games - I got a SOAP game going at a con once - and I agree, Tony, that the thrill is seeing people pick up on it. <br/>
<br/>
That said, as Matthijis said, I think this is no different than recruiting for any RPG or for a boardgame, even. That is, I like leading people to good games and fun. Whether they have a GM or not. <br/>

                            Thanks folks, I'm getting a lot out of this thread.<br/>
<br/>
TonyLB I went back and read chapter 8 of Capes. Here's the funny thing - I read the whole book before playing the game but still went into the game "blind" with no prep as if it were a Universalis game. I do remember reading that chapter but didn't seem to make the connection in my brain that maybe it was something I should be using.<br/>
<br/>
It looks powerful though. If I had started mapping out some story threads while reading the book, then yeah I think I would have been stoked to go out and enlist purely to see my story threads in play. It strikes me as something similar to what happens with my friends who GM white wolf games. They become entranced by the wonderful colour of the setting while reading the latest book and start imagining it while still reading. They then spend a lot of energy recruiting a group because its the only way to extend and "fufill" the imagining they began. <br/>
<br/>
I think that's what I'll take away from this thread. How can I get the reader to start imagining *now* while still reading and so compel them to get a group together, teach people the game and so get to see their own imaginings played out? ... but in a GMless low-prep game.                        </div>

                            Well, I don't own dogs. For myself and my own game I was thinking that alongside all those examples I give for every stage of the system in action, I should be getting the player to build their own character and let them see the system in action on their own girl (or own samurai or whatever). I guess its that idea of playing the game while still reading the book before play actually begins. I think it was discussed on the forge years ago. Players enter into that dreamy world of imagined play whilst stll reading. I think also many friends of mine have given up on actual play and just buy books to read now because their play just doesn't realise the standards of colour inspired by the book.<br>
<br>
In fact system-heads reading BESM have the same experience. Its not the colour that inspires them its the crunchiness of the system that they start imagining about. They start playing in their head.<br/>
