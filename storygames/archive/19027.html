I know there have been some discussions here, and there were a bunch at the forge, and if anyone wants to link to them that would be great.  I get a lot out of threads like this on SG that I wouldn't think of or would poorly articulate.  Clearly loads of people have played using these techniques and enjoyed doing so.  I've certainly done a bang-up job using them in the past, but now I have techniques that work way better for me - any game that seems to really require lots of either I'd rather simply not run, and I never really enjoyed being on the playing end of them.<br/><br/>Let me throw out a couple caveats - obviously these techniques are going to be spectrums, and honestly on a 1-to-10 rating I'm probably a 3 or 4 most of the time, where I used to often be a 7 or 8.  I've had fun with them and used them pretty well, well enough to have a small set of anecdotes to that effect if I need to employ them.  So, I want to try to avoid coming off like people shouldn't be doing this.<br/><br/>That said, most of the frustration I've experienced as a player has come from playing traditional games where railroading and illusionism were prominent; many of the somewhat-bitter jokes people I know share about gming are essentially variations on characters going off the rails or aiming for goals we didn't want to accommodate.  I just got the Tome of Adventure Design from the recent Bundle of Holding; the first principle of adventure design Finch espouses is maximizing meaningful player decisions, which looks great to me but would seem to be the opposite of railroading and badly undermine illusionism.  Then reading Eero's Doyle/Watson breakdown (<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19012/osr-encouraging-players-to-think-things-through-ask-questions-take-care#Item_17" rel="nofollow">in this thread</a>) made me think - if the players don't have serious buy-in on the railroad or illusions then massive resentments build whenever the techniques aren't used perfectly, and games subsequently seem to have come out with more and more player entitlements to try to 'protect' against the gm's 'power,' while continuing to loudly proclaim Rule Zero as primarily the gm's prerogative.<br/><br/>So.  Assuming there's a lot I don't understand (a safe bet), what is the good thing about railroading and illusionism?  What is the killer app?  Loads of people had play sufficiently functional to really enjoy - what facilitated that?<br/><br/>And - sorry if it looks like I'm calling you out, contracycle.  You've been particularly vocal about these techniques in recent threads and I'd like to know more of your perspective, specifically, as well as anyone else that would like to weigh in.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424881/#Comment_424881" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-27T21:13:58+00:00" title="November 27, 2013  9:13PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First of all, plenty of people say railroading is 100% negative - if you do something and it's positive at all, it can't be railroading by their definitions. I dunno, maybe.<br/><br/>But by my lights, here are things railroading is good for:<br/><br/>* The game goes somewhere and doesn't just go around and around in circles when people forget what they're doing or what their characters want or we haven't gotten together in 2 months and people forgot all kinds of stuff about the game.  Sometimes you just need to yell "WELP IT LOOKS LIKE ITS TIME TO GO ON UP TO THE SPOOKY OLE HAUNTED HOUSE AND SEE IF YOU CAN FIND YOUR UNCLE EDGAR, YOU ARE STANDING AT THE SPOOKY ENTRANCE GATE WHAT NOW"<br/><br/>* You can skip over inconsequential decisions that don't actually mean anything and get to what people want or came for.  Why not skip to the dungeon entrance if they're here for the dang dungeon?<br/><br/>* You can begin in media res! That's pretty cool, right? 100% railroading.<br/><br/>* probably a lot more stuff, idk<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424883/#Comment_424883" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-27T21:54:25+00:00" title="November 27, 2013  9:54PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, but: "Skipping inconsequential decisions" = good; "All decisions are inconsequential" = bad \u2014 they're very different gaming styles.<br/><br/>Anyway, I think there are two important branches to consider here, Case 1 and Case 2. Both have what I call a Point of No Return, where once you know enough/too much about RPGs on a structural level, they become unacceptable.<br/><br/>Case 1 is what the Forge referred to as Participationism, which JDCorley references in his post, the "it's ok railroading/illusionism because everyone is at least tacitly on board with it." This happens in a lot of ongoing campaigns in their middle and later stages, where everyone knows that eventually there's going to be a confrontation with the Big Bad and the heroes will triumph and yay.<br/><br/>The Point of No Return for this style of play is that, well, if you're going to do genre emulation, why aren't we doing it in a system that gives us some real input into the fiction? SotC/FATE, for example, is much better at doing stories in a particular genre without deprotagonizing the PCs than D&amp;D or Exalted (and Monsterhearts is better than Vampire, Dread is better than CoC, etc.).<br/><br/>Case 2 is where there's actual Illusionism going on. The GM is genuinely succeeding at hiding from the players the true (lack of) consequences of their actions.<br/><br/>I think the Point of No Return here is simpler: if you GM a lot, have played a lot of games, are good at math, or any combination thereof, you'll eventually notice. At which point you can either vote with your feet, or become a Participationist. But either way, True Illusionism is always fleeting.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424887/#Comment_424887" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-27T23:20:51+00:00" title="November 27, 2013 11:20PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is what Jason is talking about railroading at all? I mean, simply starting in medias res or pre-selecting the subject matter of the session doesn't seem to me like the core property of this thing called railroading. That's just distributing the tasks and authorities of playing the game in a particular manner. For example, I write in the <i>Solar System</i> rules that a central Story Guide responsibility in TSoY is to do "dramatic coordination", which means skipping over inconsequential matters and making constructive choices that lead towards opportunities for the players to make choices instead of away from them. I would not choose to call this "railroading", despite it being about the GM making some choices.<br/><br/>Rather, if I had to explain why railroading is felt as problematic, I would point at the kind of play where the the GM controls the plot of events that the players are <i>supposedly</i> influencing by their actions. Illusionism is very close to this concept, although there are other kinds of illusionism as well. My understanding is that the concept of railroading has emerged not as a theory term like "illusionism", but rather as a very frank observation about what it feels like to play a traditional adventure roleplaying game when the GM is not playing honesty: you're supposedly enmeshed in this scenario and engaging with it, but in actual fact the GM is pulling the string to ensure that his pre-planned outcomes occur. Play is "on rails" in the sense that your choices are illusionary.<br/><br/>I should note that we did a pretty thorough investigation of participationist play in 06-09 or so around here, with the intent to see how enjoyable it might be for a post-Forgean crew, when played with intent. The conclusion was pretty much that once the players are on board the railroad and know that their choices and input on the big decisions don't matter, the enjoyment of play will largely rest on the GM being an entertaining storyteller; the players will still participate, but their participation is reduced to providing audience reactions (often via their characters), and controlling the pacing (how quickly we continue on to the next scene) and focus (how much we ask the GM to tell as about detail X) of the storytelling. It's potentially a very functional style of play, although if you're doing it participationist-style, with the players acknowledging that they're just along for the ride, you'll need to make sure that everybody takes their responsibility of "basic roleplaying" seriously despite that: some types of players (myself included, I have to actively restrain myself) will start fooling around once they realize that they're on rails and therefore not responsible for what happens.<br/><br/>Personally I only find railroading a problem when it is not explicit, and in general it is rarely explicit - I think that many trad roleplayers would feel vaguely foolish if they truly dragged GMing practices into broad daylight and explicitly affirmed with the whole group that yes, this is the extent of preplanning and subtle control that we accept from the GM. I was just reading some <i>Only War</i> adventure material a couple days back, and I felt that it captured the actual attitudes involved pretty well: the GM is egging the players on to immerse and engage in an adventurous military conundrum, planning carefully how they'll accomplish a mission, but on the other hand he's "ensuring that this NPC gets away" and "increasing resistance here if the PCs decide to choose this route" and so on. That's what I understand by railroading, and I personally can't stomach it, I find it a reprehensible and lazy way to construe the possibilities of a roleplaying game. We can be better than just puppets in the GM's play. I can understand the rpg history that brings us to <i>Only War</i>, which so very much wants to be old school D&amp;D from the player viewpoint (I mean, the sort of play that it attempts to offer, we do that every week extremely well in our OSR campaign) while accomplishing it all with control-freak GM micromanagement of setpieces, quantum ogres and other supposedly invisible strings. I can understand the history and psychology that has brought us to this point, I just can't accept it as a roadmap for my own play.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424889/#Comment_424889" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-28T00:25:46+00:00" title="November 28, 2013 12:25AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some more good things about railroading:<br/><br/>* You never get to the end of the campaign and feel like nothing happened or you didn't accomplish anything.

But what-people-call-railroading often includes techniques that are totally normal and not objectionable at all in other contexts and groups. <br/><br/>I once had someone tell me that if we sat down to play a GURPS or FATE game, and I said "this is a game about superspy secret agents in 1987, make a swashbuckling secret agent in 1987" and they made a flying psychic caveman from an alternate world and I said they couldn't play them, that was railroading.  Why not? It's certainly taking major consequential decisions out of the hands of a player and gripping it desperately in my tyrannical GM grasp, after all.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424890/#Comment_424890" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-28T00:53:02+00:00" title="November 28, 2013 12:53AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that seem strange - I wouldn't call it "railroading" if one of the players has simply chosen the subject matter in advance. I guess if your conception of GURPS fundamentally involves a "subjective right to play any character conceivable", then it'd make sense to call the GM on it, but as far as I know neither GURPS nor FATE has any provisions whatsoever for that sort of arrangement - it's clearly some weird hack to claim such a subjective player right in a game that very much relies on somebody choosing a topic and planning a campaign in advance.<br/><br/>I get the difficulties of terminology in this type of discussion, of course - everything depends on what we mean by the words we choose. It is entirely possible that there is no grounds for disagreement on this topic, simply because on closer analysis we find that everybody substantially agrees on what's fun and functional, and the only difference is that for some reason some people have adopted the label of "railroading" in different ways. For me it's pretty natural to use it the way I described, and it seems unnatural to use it in the way Jason is using it (apparently for any possible choices the GM might make regarding the direction of play?), but that's probably because we've learned the word itself in entirely different contexts.<br/><br/>In any case, my intent was in no way to imply that railroading is bad "by definition". I hopefully explained in broad terms what I understand by the word, and why I find it less than optimal for my own play. As far as I can see there's no reason to accuse anybody of engaging in a logical fallacy here. If anybody wants to demonstrate how railroading as I outlined it above (invasive techniques for preempting the significance of player-made choices in the game) is actually <i>good</i>, then we might have some grounds for debate. Lacking that, we'll just have to agree to agree, and perhaps list some more good things that somebody somewhere might call railroading <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TotallyGuy" title="TotallyGuy"><img alt="TotallyGuy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TotallyGuy">TotallyGuy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424893/#Comment_424893" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-28T01:53:19+00:00" title="November 28, 2013  1:53AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 28, 2013 1:55AM by TotallyGuy.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was at IndieCon a few weeks ago and a friend of mine shared an anecdote of this time he ran a really good improvised traditional scenario.  <b>The Anecdote:</b> The players all had a really good time and were talking about it in the bar afterwards.  One person approached my friend and asked if he could have the scenario for running it for his group.  When he found out the scenario was improvised in its entirety his attitude changed and suddenly he hated the session and felt that it didn't really count.  My friend was surprised by the player's ability to rewrite his memory of the experience.<br/><br/>I thought about my own experiences.  I wanted to agree with the message of my friend's story.  But if you switch out "improvised" and add in "illusionism" or "railroading" I find that my memories of games I've experienced get rewritten too to some extent.  Maybe not in exactly that way.  But if I go into a game carrying doubt then future games just don't work.  And for a while I was convinced that these practices were so widespread that I couldn't put my doubts away.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424900/#Comment_424900" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-28T07:45:56+00:00" title="November 28, 2013  7:45AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A couple of things that might be of interest. (They might not be!)<br/><br/>Nine years ago (good lord!) I started a thread on RPG.net called, <i><a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?89655-When-People-Say-quot-Railroading-quot" rel="nofollow">When People Say "Railroading"</a></i>... because it occurred to me that conversations about railroading go all over the map as what people are the specifics of railroading <i>is</i> seems to behave like a blob of mercury being attacked by a nail. (Witness Jason dragging in any sort of setting strictures as "Railroading" above!)<br/><br/>What I learned in that long, 16 page thread is -- as far as I could tell from the anecdotal sample -- "railroading" as a term actually has no specific principles. It is a term that refers to a spectrum of techniques and it <i>becomes</i> railroading when it pisses someone off. I really mean that. The definition game can continue down this thread for five more pages, and I don't think it will ever be found. Because it's only when someone's personal sense of "creative honor" (or something) is triggered that the term is dragged in.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>A side point, touching on TotallyGuy's story:<br/><br/>There is, in gaming/nerd/geek/whatever culture, a true lack of trust/enjoyment of spontaneity and creativity. <br/><br/>There, I said it.<br/><br/>There is a desire and fetishization for things to be pre-planned and intellectualized. It's "smart" when things are done that way. It's "real." <br/><br/>Witness, for example, the absolute need to believe in some circles that George Lucas knew exactly where <i>Star Wars</i> was going before the first movie came out. A greater appreciation for the movies is granted because Lucas had some sort of master plot between Luke and Darth and so on. But, pro tip: <i><a href="http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2010/05/lost-gets-a-letter-from-george-lucas.html" rel="nofollow">Lucas was making it up as he was going</a></i>. But the Grail for lots of smart folks who value being smart (being knowing, being intellectually in control, in knowing more than others, having information others don't have and revealing it to others at the most appropriate times) is exactly this: I knew everything ahead of time.<br/><br/>I remember discussing Sorcerer on the Internet back in 2001-2002 -- specifically it's lack of location and plot based pre-plotting and prep -- people resounding with real rage at the notion the game <i>could work at all</i>. Now, for the people of this community, raised as we are on all sort of "make it up as you go play" it might be really hard to believe this. But it was true. Over at RPG.net, in once discussion, I was told by people to take my discussions on the matter out of the Tabletop Roleplaying Open forum and move it over to the Game Design &amp; Development forum, because it was not only considered so radical a notion but was <i>pissing people off</i>.<br/><br/>Now, keep in mind, for years people could say to you with a straight face "I never force my players to do anything," while still talking about their "GM Plot." What I was doing then (not to piss people off, but to talk about my excitement that made no-plot play explicit) was calling people out on their bullshit. As Eero says, if you've going to have a plot, say it out loud so everyone can know it. That way everyone is a) onboard and b) decide if they want to do it. But to be the puppeteer is kind of weird.<br/><br/>Over at the <a href="http://playsorcerer.wordpress.com" rel="nofollow">Play Sorcerer</a> blog, <a href="http://playsorcerer.wordpress.com/2013/11/25/play-sorcerer-35-if-we-dont-have-a-plot-how-do-we-have-a-story/" rel="nofollow">I quote Shawn Ryan as part of this post</a>:\n<blockquote>The Interviewer asked, \u201cWhat did you learn while working on <i>Angel</i> with Joss Wheadon?\u201d<br/><br/>And Shawn Ryan replied:<br/><br/>The main thing I learned from him is to approach stories from a character point of view, as opposed to a plot point of view. Forget about the plot in the beginning, because if you know what emotional journey you want to take your character on, the rest will follow. We break our crime stories [on <i>The Shield</i>] not in terms of who did this and what\u2019s the clue; it\u2019s what do we want our cops to go through on this particular story. Once we know that, the plot will come later.</blockquote>\nI'll posit that lots of gamer's really, really love <i>plot</i>. They want to know it was thought out to make sense. To get the characters from here to there. That it is "smart." <a href="http://badassdigest.com/2012/10/30/film-crit-hulk-smash-hulk-vs.-plot-holes-and-movie-logic/" rel="nofollow">That it doesn't have "plot holes."</a> When the fact is, there are plenty of ways of creating that moves forward through the narrative in completely different ways. Stephen King, for example, finds a situation and just writes. Ray Bradbury advised, "Find out what your character wants and follow him." (That's the <i>Sorcerer</i> way.)<br/><br/>But that isn't, in my view, what many of the people in the RPG community value. Or <i>want</i> to value. <br/><br/>I'll add that one doesn't have to go back to 2003 to see such reactions of course. I had a discussion with someone on this site about <i>Sorcerer</i> Bangs just a few years ago where he insisted that the entire notion that the GM could introduce new points of narrative pressure on the Player Characters could only lead to utterly random and entirely preposterous events one time after another. Why this had to be the case I have no idea. But the notion of not having all "assets" already built out by the GM seems produce a kind of panic in lots and lots of people in this hobby. Such play, the thinking goes, can only lead to all sorts of illogical craziness. That there is no reason to do things that are either illogical or crazy seems off the table as an argument. To not have all the assets and details of the world already planned out, in this person's logic, will make crazy, illogical things happen.<br/><br/>When I saw TotallyGuy's I though of all this stuff. <br/><br/>***<br/><br/>I don't think a discussion about railroading can slip past the two above points easily:<br/><br/>a) people mean different things by it, but have personal tripwires for when it <i>is</i> railroading<br/>b) the very complex relationship many RPGers have to the value of pre-planning and everything being smart and making sense or it doesn't have value                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424901/#Comment_424901" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-28T07:59:18+00:00" title="November 28, 2013  7:59AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>Railroading is a difficult topic for exactly the reasons Eero laid out above.  If we want to still consider the things JD mention it's easy to see those as the low hanging fruit of railroading where player choice is restricted but it's done to make play functional and/or not completely insane as in the case of the psychic alternate world caveman spy.  What those instances of railroading don't necessarily lead to is a play style where player input is virtually not required to tell us how the situation is going to resolve.  They set up the situation or maybe move it forward when things get off track but they dont determine the outcomes.<br/><br/>The most functional form of railroading I've seen is usually one where the GM sets up the situation, knows the approximate likely outcomes and leaves a little wiggle room for player impact.  It's typically a situation where the players have to investigate to figure out what is going on.  Since the GM knows the whole story he can rule out any attempts by the players to address the situation in a manner that doesnt fit the pre planned scenario, it may even make sense to do so since this is his conception of how the world actually is.  No need of using force on his part beyond the initial creation of the idea.  Play is locked in to revealing the secrets and then resolving them and how it's resolved can be slightly different.  A typical situation would have the characters take part in an investigation that leads them to a result where they need to acquire some sort of Macguffin.  The players can decide to steal it back, kill the guards for it or negotiate and buy the item,  the end result is the same they end up with the item and there was little to no chance of it happening any other way.  The game is on rails and we dont have to worry about it going another way.  The players don't question whether acquiring the item is the right thing to do they simply learn it needs to be done and then we set about seeing how they do it.<br/><br/>The usefulness of this type of play is it limits the amount of improv the GM needs to do.  He needs to know what mystery needs to be solved and possible ways to solve it, he can even leave it open and accept what ever reasonable solution the players come up with but we know that eventually their will be a solution.   <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424904/#Comment_424904" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-28T08:15:10+00:00" title="November 28, 2013  8:15AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great story, Guy. Absolutely great illustration. (And, excellent exegesis, Christopher!)<br/><br/>I would add that I think there's a reasonable middle ground here: Some things should be develop-in-play and others should be pre-planned. I have a Burning Wheel scenario that I've run three times, The Dwarven Frontier. (You were in it at Burning Con, Guy.) There are a number of elements that are pre-set: the asshole older brother of the Prince PC; the goblins, who are slaves of the spiders, the latter of whom are the *real* threat in the story; the existence of a few other Relationship NPCs. I wouldn't violate any of those things. But there are tons of details to be filled in. The first time I ran it, it turned out that the spiders worshipped an ancient demon god sleeping beneath the mountain (I used the Behema stats from the Monster Burner; the PCs blew it up with dynamite, it was pretty great). That didn't come up the other two times, and I didn't force it.<br/><br/>I should mention that I deliberately tried to encourage the players to add setting elements, by, for example, giving the Adventurer PC Loot-wise and Tomb-wise. But no matter what, I wouldn't allow anyone, myself included, to violate the basic premises of the adventure.<br/><br/>And that's what I think a lot of the scaredy cats are missing: the principle that there are *some* things that are inviolate, and that even in a completely improvised game, no one is allowed to introduce elements that contradict previously established material.<br/><br/>Additionally, in certain kinds of games, I think it's entirely reasonable to want certain things to be known ahead of time by the GM. The obvious example is a murder mystery. Unless it's explicitly develop-in-play like Serial Homicide Unit or Dirty Secrets, I'd be pretty pissed if the GM acted like he knew who-dun-it all along only to find out later he was just improvising.<br/><br/>I think it's sort of the flip-side of the idea that, if we're going to railroad, we should be upfront about it: if the plot is going to be improvised, you need to warn people of that.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424905/#Comment_424905" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-28T08:17:45+00:00" title="November 28, 2013  8:17AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, also, I think the disappointing endings to certain TV shows point to the need to pre-plot *some* things.

I'm not sure you can equate the two but then again I'm not all that fond of "mystery" in RPG's.  I think you can get the amazing plot twists just as reliably out of many other kinds of stories and the big mystery constantly set up in Lost was really unlikely to ever be resolved in a satisfying manner, what answer could they give to the mystical magical things that were going on other than it was mystical and magical and all happening for mystical magical reasons?  This is getting off topic but compare two shows Vince Gilligan worked on X-files and Breaking Bad, I'll take the twists and turns of Breaking Bad any day over the mystery developed in X-files.

Things "count" when there are points to be had and a goal to be won.<br/><br/>Some people enjoy the player-versus-environment aspect of RPGs and if the game ends the way they wanted to, they feel that they personally did well: they as players were clever enough to best the GM's traps. If they discover that the GM's traps were adjusted on the fly to fit the available characters and players, obviously this player's "win" doesn't "count", and therefore they'll feel bitter and cheated.<br/><br/>This is a bit similar to illusionism. The player had the illusion that their skill and/or choices "counted", that if they chose badly they could get nowhere or fail at the task.<br/><br/>Other people enjoy discovery/exploration/investigation and are disappointed when they find out there was nothing to discover. Again, it's like illusionism: it doesn't matter whether you go left or right because the GM didn't figure out what'll be there in advance. Wherever you go, that's where the plot will be.

Even in games where it's not possible for one person to influence the contribution of others (like Microscope) the group has to "gel" for the story to work.<br/><br/>(I have a theory that Microscope ends up going gonzo when one person introduces something others aren't comfortable with or inspired by, but they can't veto it whether for reasons of social pressure or game structure - however I haven't been able to thoroughly test it, have you ever observed something similar?).<br/><br/>(That said, I have been railroaded myself, in the "no preparation for the final fight you come up with is possible, and then because you're so unprepared and too weak, extremely powerful GM-NPCs step in and solve everything, yay!" way, so I know the feeling. I never figured out what the GM was expecting from the players, but it was clear that he WAS expecting something. It's almost like there's an expectation that magically both the GM and the players will be on the same page with regards to the story, and the players will come up with the solution the GM wants, but sometimes this fails, and for some reason asking about the expectations is impolite or something... almost feels like an extension of geek social fallacies <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> )                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ToddSpengo" title="ToddSpengo"><img alt="ToddSpengo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ToddSpengo">ToddSpengo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424912/#Comment_424912" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-28T09:47:55+00:00" title="November 28, 2013  9:47AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I remember getting railroaded once so badly I almost quit the game:<br/><br/><i>The GM threw our characters through some sort of portal into a new world.

It felt like a real achievement to have survived that assault. Guess what happens? In the midst of fleeing, one of the scorpion-things turns around, comes back, knocks me out, and then runs away again.<br/><br/>Clearly, the GM meant us all to start this new campaign a certain way and that way did not include us not getting KO'd at the start.

It is funny that those first couple examples that JDCorley used are precisely what I think of as scene framing and establishing situation - they seem well down on the spectrum even in games where they are entirely the gm prerogative (most trad games- funnily enough it is this distibution of authority that is the foremost signifier to me that I am playing a trad game).<br/><br/>It looks like consent, explicit or implicit, is the dividing line that makes functional railroading and illusionism.  I'll be honest, I don't see how that distinguishes them from any other gaming technique!  The terms seem to overlap completely with "who has authority over what happens next" when used in a nuetral tone, which makes me want to know how they are so commonly conflated with abuse of that authority.<br/><br/>With that in mind, I still am really interested in advocacy for the upper end of the scale where the gm has a strict policy of preventing deviation from their plan, and/or maintaining the appearance of player autonomy when their characters are not able to have significant influence on events or outcomes.  That's a lot of framing the question, sorry, I'm trying to point to an approach I've seen people enjoy that I don't relate to well.

Terminology is a bitch.  Authority, for me, is a moral-value neutral term; when you're playing a rpg, someone has the conch at any given time, and your group has a social contract that more-or-less establishes the baseline, which is adjusted as necessary for the system of play you are using.  And the current play environment, and so on, down to whatever level of influence is relevant to this conversation.<br/><br/>The point of this thread, for me, was to try to get a perspective from the other side of the line, preferably one with more depth than "people like different things" and "these things are a spectrum."  Especially since I can often get useful insights here about exactly these kind of subjects, and, generally, avoid entrenched terminology warfare and "everything is everything, definition is useless" arguments.  It looks like railroading and illusionism are just loaded terms, and don't have enough of a consistent signifier that identifies them strongly enough to break free of "people like different things" and "these things are a spectrum," except that they are often used pejoratively.<br/><br/>I'll see if I can come up with a better, more evocative phrasing.  I'm loaded from dinner.

No deception, no illusionism. But sure, you can be upfront about railroading.<br/><br/>Now, to be sure, games like WGP, that have explicit rules about pacing, are not to the tastes of many gamers. But it's hardly fair to say that the games themselves are being dishonest.<br/><br/>Also, I thought of an easier way to say what I was trying to get at earlier: GMing a lot and/or playing a wide variety of games will simply kill dead successful illusionist techniques, for that player.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424945/#Comment_424945" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-28T23:40:19+00:00" title="November 28, 2013 11:40PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is the GM of a WGP game being dishonest when he lets someone beat the villain's plan after only 4 losses?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424962/#Comment_424962" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-29T11:12:22+00:00" title="November 29, 2013 11:12AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...yes?<br/><br/>I mean I'm not sure that's the actual rule, I thought it was just harder to beat the villains earlier on in the narrative arc, not impossible.<br/><br/>But sure, yes.

I seem to be remembering that it's an objective mechanical criterion that tells you when the villain's plan is permanently beaten, having to do with filling the card tracks. The GM has many tasks in that game as well, but one of them is not to decide when the story ends.<br/><br/>Still, I get Jason's point: yes, you can be dishonest for the player characters or against them, this doesn't make any difference to me. Being a "fan of the PCs" is not a carte blanche towards anything else, really. That is, I can't really name any moves that would become more acceptable at the game table just because you did them with helping the player characters in mind. I mean, what sort of games are you people playing if making life easier for the PCs is somehow a desirable and noble endeavour that justifies anything that would otherwise be suspect?

With Great Power is, specifically, a story game, and it gives you guidelines as to how to write that story. You can't play it to win, because the result is known in advance. (In more traditional RPGs, the heroes are usually supposed to win as well, but there's usually at least a fig leaf of deniability). (I played WGP by the way).<br/><br/>I guess it may be the result of marketing? Traditional games used to be advertised - and I'm speaking from the perspective of the Polish RPG market which may be quite different from UK and US - as "you can be whoever you want and do whatever you want". Which is, of course, wrong, since it's not a single player game and therefore you play with other people, including the GM. And then playing WITH requires some negotiation over where you all want to go, like, I don't know, on a trip to the country where you have only one car so you can't go sightseeing everywhere at once.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424971/#Comment_424971" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-29T12:23:19+00:00" title="November 29, 2013 12:23PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>...yes?<br/><br/>I mean I'm not sure that's the actual rule, I thought it was just harder to beat the villains earlier on in the narrative arc, not impossible.</blockquote>\nYou can take out or even kill the villains themselves, but you can't beat the plan until you've filled the whole card track.\n<blockquote>But sure, yes.

In the introductory text it says "the player characters will go left. If they go right, increasingly dangerous monsters attack them until they go left".  Clearly the module designer felt that the decision to go right or left was not meaningful and forcing the players to go left was not railroading. But young JD felt that it was railroading, and objectionable, because exploration was part of his D&amp;D play and which way you go is a big part of exploration.  And would it have been less railroading to "scene frame" past that decision with "you go right down the path and arrive at the evil cave" and just completely skip the choice?<br/><br/>And would it have mattered if it was in the main AD&amp;D rulebook instead of in a module?  <br/><br/>PS I had someone tell me once that Dragonlance module wasn't railroading because you could still go right and fight against ultra-dangerous monsters until TPK, high five everyone and call the campaign awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/summerdown" title="summerdown"><img alt="summerdown" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/summerdown">summerdown</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424980/#Comment_424980" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-29T15:35:08+00:00" title="November 29, 2013  3:35PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 29, 2013 3:37PM by summerdown.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think (i.e. my suggestion is that) railroading is where:\n<ol style="list-style-type: lower-latin;">\n<li>Someone in power goes against the social contract</li>\n+\n<li>they do it by removing decision-making from someone not in power</li>\n+\n<li>and that person either feels disempowered by the action, or would do if they knew about it.</li>\n</ol>\nI think all three are needed.

I've been reflecting on what I get out of the game when I've put up with being railroaded.  Basically that.  I put on a show, because I know I can't accomplish any other goal than whatever the gm needs us to do next, and for some reason the type of railroading I'm talking about also pretty much means I can't move things along quicker than the gm wants either, so I have to sit around and wait for the next time I can do something that looks like an action (invariably, getting in a fight).  In that time, I sure as hell don't want to think about what my character actually wants, so to stay out of mischief (another almost inevitable outcome) I try to be entertaining.<br/><br/>Usually it ends up in mischief.  Or reading gamebooks, or the like.  As far as I can tell, many of the folks I've railroaded have felt the same way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424993">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424993/#Comment_424993" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-29T20:23:27+00:00" title="November 29, 2013  8:23PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 29, 2013 8:28PM by David_Berg.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've seen that too -- "Put on a show, try to be entertaining, and that's it" is usually insufficient when players get their hopes up for, like, agency.  So one of my top 2 ingredients for fun railroads is to make the lack of agency explicit up front.<br/><br/>My other main ingredient is for the GM to invest in <i>earning</i> entertaining reactions, rather than just spewing any old content and demanding that the players love it.  If you want a player's character to break down in horror at your Big Reveal, then build up to it the way a good movie would!

A questions that challenges the basics of how we perceive our hobby. If I may do an analogue to give a sense of how I think. When you play a game, the game sets up a goal. You do follow the rules, and by doing that you're challenged.<br/><br/>You must follow the rules in Ludo or Monopoly, but you still have the choice of which piece to move in Ludo or which estate to buy in Monopoly. I would say that railroading is override the player's choice by replacing it with one of your own.<br/><br/>Some games, like Snake and Ladders, don't have that choice and they will quickly become boring for an adult.<br/><br/>What I think is interesting is the question of why someone wants to override another participant's choice in Monopoly or Ludo. Sure, it could be easy to understand because it's a competition and everybody wants to win over one another. But in roleplaying games, it's more of a collaboration. So what do we get from removing that kind of choice? I feel roleplaying games has more to offer than the happenings in the game mechanics, i.e. what happens on the game board.<br/><br/>I'm leaving a lot unsaid, so you have to read between the lines, but to answer your question: to follow the goals within the structures of the game (which includes the rules) is not railroading. Removing another participant's choice is.

I understand players wanting to go though a classic adventure path "the right way through". I understand players, of games with detailed and gamey fighting systems, wanting to experienced designed encounters.<br/><br/>As long as everyone around the table buys into that. I don't, so much, so that's why even the existence of illusionism at someone else's table drives me crazy, and its prevalence in published game books, modules and GM guides, even worse.<br/><br/>JDCorley, you asked if it changed if it was explicitly encouraged in published material, and if it mattered if it was in the module or in the main book. I think the biggest difference is whether or not it is in a "GM-only" section. As long as the players know and accept how the game really works, it can be participationism.<br/><br/>As for the psychic caveman: having a mutually respectful dialog about setting expectations isn't railroading. In this case, the player was either deliberately pushing the GMs buttons (perhaps because they don't dig the genre exactly as presented) or, more likely, genuinely thinking that the psychic caveman would create and experience awesome stories in the spy setting.<br/><br/>It's like Scooby-Doo. The GM pitched a game about investigating teens and one of the players showed up with a giant, gluttonous talking dog with DID. <br/><br/>I think many people have a tendency to go too gonzo when creating fictional entities. I can sympathize... But that's perhaps a separate conversation from railroading.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425043/#Comment_425043" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-02T00:21:02+00:00" title="December  2, 2013 12:21AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (One of my writing voices is very tautological.

While I think some of the usages of the word "railroading" in this thread sharply deviates from the definitions I work from, that's semantics and I must try to honor my vow of not arguing semantics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425052/#Comment_425052" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-02T07:22:18+00:00" title="December  2, 2013  7:22AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Predetermined plot and scenes aren't a problem, per se, until predetermination starts trumping player input. When you have a ton of hidden GM Force ("Force" is another Forge term that basically means using game tools to make things happen), it can invalidate player choices and player actions.<br/><br/>For example, when a player says, "My guy kills the shopkeeper!" you'd expect that to have some impact on "the plot," whatever that is. If there's a predetermined plot, and murdering an innocent shopkeeper has no impact on further events in the fiction, a player starts to wonder why he makes any decisions in the first place.<br/><br/>When a player says, "I'm gonna take a big risk here and try to climb this doorless tower. I, uh, make a climb roll and get... hey! natural 20! plus 8 is 28!" and then the GM decides that the door on top the tower won't open no matter what (so as not to derail "the plot," a player has to wonder why she takes any risks or rolls any dice in the first place.<br/><br/><br/>Here's an anecdote from actual play. I was a pretty experienced AD&amp;D 2E player in my mid-20's. The DM was some 17 year-old kid who'd played a bit but was new to GMing. He invited us to build 10th level characters and show up for his one-shot adventure at the game store. I built some kind of spellcaster with tons of weird earth-related spells, like Stone to Mud and some elemental summoning stuff and whatnot.<br/><br/>Well, I lucked out and this combo let our party walk over most of the monsters pretty easily. After a while, we chase the Big Bad Guy (a high level mage) to his pyramid lair and I start using spells to just walk straight through the walls to the center instead of dealing with the rest of the monsters and traps. We're beelining right for him. The DM is clearly upset by this, and starts fudging. Suddenly this NPC wizard has special magic items that create antimagic shields and such, and we can't reach him. We say we'll camp out and wait for his spell to end. DM says it never will. We say we'll starve him to death. The game ends in a stalemate. <br/><br/>Now, I give the DM credit for at least letting the party's creative use of character abilities to short-circuit the adventure to some extent, and that was very satisfying as a player. If the DM had told us we couldn't do that, or if he'd said, "No, these walls have, uh, magic protection against Stone to Mud..." (and hadn't made that a feature of the dungeon before we'd tried it), then I'd feel stymied and shut down. But that ending was very unsatisfying, because the DM just didn't want us to kill the NPC wizard and get the treasure, so he made some stuff up to prevent it from happening. We were clearly in a Step On Up / Gamist situation -- or at least the players seemed to think so -- and the DM cheated.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425067/#Comment_425067" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-02T12:39:12+00:00" title="December  2, 2013 12:39PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great story!

Adam, would it have changed your experience if before, during or after the game the GM had shown you a spot in the module where it said to do exactly what the GM was doing?<br/><br/>I tend to lean towards "not" - I think GM or designer decisionmaking can remove choices that people want (including flying cavemen apparently) but I think it does matter to some people whether a person at the table did it or whether a far distant game designer did it.<br/><br/>Edit: Here's another example/question. If the mechanics of the game are set up so that important NPCs are harder to kill (FATE, Cortex+, etc.), is that railroading?  We've established that we hate GMs that throw some extra hit points onto a NPC to make them really hard to kill if they think that NPC is important to "the story", right? Right, we glare at them and frown, maybe even spit on the sidewalk if a cop isn't looking. So when a designer does the same thing isn't it just as bad - isn't it a thousand times as bad since the designer isn't even at the table to see if people are excited or frustrated?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425086/#Comment_425086" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-03T07:53:20+00:00" title="December  3, 2013  7:53AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>  - isn't it a thousand times as bad since the designer isn't even at the table to see if people are excited or frustrated?</blockquote>\nIt's 1000X more pointless to get mad, however.

One cannot get around the fact that Dragonlance breaks faith seriously, irrevocably, with the game that the old school AD&amp;D gamer is expecting - if you are to maintain trust and avoid betrayal, you have to explain to the player that this game is not the free adventure sandbox they were expecting, but rather something entirely different. What makes for an experience of railroading in Dragonlance is simply that it encourages the GM to seize powers and use dirty tricks that are not legitimate in the eyes of the players.<br/><br/>(The above is substantially a pretty nasty characterization of Dragonlance; in fact it is a relatively moderate example of the new school of D&amp;D, compared to what would come later. Still, the core of the issue is as I have written it, as Dragonlance does not hesitate to force the issue when players would desire to leave its at times surprisingly wide plot funnel.)<br/><br/>In other words: Dragonlance is a bad example of game designer railroading because it is not strictly speaking game designer railroading at all: the game it is designed for repudiates the practices that Dragonlance encourages, and Dragonlance itself is not a rulebook, but rather scenario material for the GM to execute. It is the GM who is responsible for it when he offers Dragonlance to his players, either he gains their acceptance for the methods of the game or risks accusations of railroading. If Dragonlance were genuinely a game of its own, and it was presented to the players with the ordinary procedures of learning and accepting a new game, I see no particular reason for anybody to be angry with it, except perhaps their inflexible assumptions about how roleplaying games should work.<br/><br/>My own thinking regarding railroading is that it is strictly an experiental phenomenon: it is something we experience as players when the GM abuses us. Thus it would be a mistake to attempt to define it in objective external terms, it all depends on our expectations and the rules and procedures of the game, and how the GM acts. I cannot name an example of a railroading practice that would not be legitimate were it accepted by the players, and all railroading experiences I've ever had have had to do with the players not accepting the kinds of control the GM imposes. We speak of plot control most often when we speak of railroading, but that's not the core of the psychological phenomenon, but rather it merely happens to be the case that GMs most often overstep their bounds by preplotting, rather than in some other way.<br/><br/>If one desires for an objective definition of railroading, it seems to me that the best you can get is an analysis of cultural history: given the history of roleplaying and how the trad playstyle developed out of early (old school) adventure gaming, it may be said that the vast majority of railroading difficulties have to do with players expecting an adventure game (PC freedom, objective situation and setting, neutral GM) when the GM is in fact proffering trad dramatism (GM plot, illusionist procedure, focus on emotional and aesthetic content instead of consequential player choices). From these general wellsprings flow the multitude of negotiated compromises that we see across game groups, organic oral lawbooks of what is the cricket of GM-ful play and what is beyond the pale. This is just a generalization, though, and as has been said in this thread, it is possible to encounter all sorts of local expectations that may give rise to peculiar local understanding of what is legitimate GM power and what's not.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425095/#Comment_425095" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-03T09:07:26+00:00" title="December  3, 2013  9:07AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I agree, that's a great story. Adam, would it have changed your experience if before, during or after the game the GM had shown you a spot in the module where it said to do exactly what the GM was doing?</blockquote>\nDepends. If the module basically gave advice to cheat if the players were smart, no, that'd suck ass. If the module said, "This particular wizard has a last-ditch defense plan where he'll hole up in an anti-magic shell and wait for backup," then that could be okay. It means that the GM wasn't just reacting to our success and trying to thwart it by cheating. I really don't mind when a product design builds in script immunity for certain important NPCs. <br/><br/>The competitive side of Gamist D&amp;D requires the GM (or adventure designer) and players to be adversaries. During play, the GM puts down the adversary role and is supposed to impartially referee the game. If the GM uses hidden Force, there's no point in playing to win. The deck is stacked against you, either way. <br/><br/>Now in practice, most GM fudging is actually done to keep characters alive, not kill them. That's a different feeling of having your input invalidated. It's like you sat down to play chess with a Grand Master, and ZOMG ACTUALLY BEAT HIM but then found out later that he was just letting you win. It deflates any victory you had.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425096/#Comment_425096" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-03T09:11:27+00:00" title="December  3, 2013  9:11AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 3, 2013 9:15AM by JDCorley.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with you (CK) that the experience is the same.  What I'm getting at is that mechanically many games provide similar experiences but we don't have similar feelings about them.<br/><br/>Here's a thought experiment:<br/><br/>* Group A is playing a Champions module from 1980 that I have where it says "no matter what the characters do, the villain will escape at the end of this chapter" with normal Champions rules. <br/><br/>* Group B is playing a Mutants &amp; Masterminds version of the same scenario; in one of Mutants &amp; Masterminds' optional rules, villains <i>may</i> spend a limited resource (I believe called Villain Points in earlier editions, can't remember if it stayed this way through 3rd) in order to escape a scene. The main game text urges GMs to use almost all the villain points up before the big ending confrontation so that the characters have had sufficient setbacks to make defeating the villain satisfying. B1: They're playing a module that says "if things get too hairy for the villain, he will spend a Villain Point to escape"; B2: The scenario they're playing does not have such a text. They're winning a little too handily/easily, the GM frantically looks around, panicking, this can't happen, not his precious NPC! He spots the escape rule, relievedly spends a Villain Point, the villain escapes.<br/><br/>We all agree the text in the module in A is bad module design and GMs should not follow these bad instructions or they are likely to create a bad experience. Cool, well and good.<br/><br/>There's no difference between A, B1 and B2 in terms of player experience (or is there?)  Yet I think everyone agrees that <i>for some reason not related to player experience</i> B1 and B2 are better than A because the villain's escape is written and incorporated into the rules of the game, even though it's an optional rule (and even though the GM may choose not to spend Villain Points in that way.)<br/><br/>It also seems some are saying B1 is less objectionable than B2 because it's pre-written - it's not a haphazard decision made "on a whim", as you put it.  But that distinction just seems hopeless if we're tracking player experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/d.anderson" title="d.anderson"><img alt="d.anderson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/d.anderson">d.anderson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425097/#Comment_425097" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-03T09:12:31+00:00" title="December  3, 2013  9:12AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 3, 2013 9:13AM by d.anderson.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seconded on that- a lot of railroading seems to be rooted in being unable to reconcile expectations, often being unable to really talk frankly about them in the first place, and seems to be really loaded because it is an accusation of being anti-fun that usually falls entirely on one person's shoulders.<br/><br/>That said.  There is another part that I am interested in, where the 'system' (not necessarily just mechanics but the implied agenda, principles, etc throughout a game's text and maybe even play culture) encourages unilateral removal of player choice at junctures that would seem to be important places to facilitate choices.<br/><br/>I probably need an example here, heh.

(That's basically what Creative Agenda is, with the addition of "and which kind of choices are rewarded by your friends?") <br/><br/>An RPG session is a string of choices. D&amp;D and most traditional games go something like:<br/><br/>1. GM presents a setting.<br/>2. Players choose characters to play in that setting.<br/>3. GM presents a situation. <br/>4. GM gives details about the situation and setting.<br/>5. Players choose what their character does.<br/>6. GM interprets those actions, maybe with dice. <br/>7. Repeat some or all of the above until done.<br/><br/>Each player step is a set of choices. Invalidate those choices, and the players wonder why they bother making them. The GM could just read a book to them instead.<br/><br/>Yes, the player steps are also a set of tableside actions that include role-playing and talking in funny voices. And each GM step includes a bunch of info-dump and storytelling to the players. There are probably some Illusionist (and Participationist) groups where the plot is predetermined and the GM just pulls the puppet strings and tells her story. Those groups are probably functional and having fun. Most players don't want that for their RPG experience though. They want their choices at the table to matter, else they'd just go see a movie.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425102/#Comment_425102" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-03T09:44:32+00:00" title="December  3, 2013  9:44AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 3, 2013 9:44AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason,<br/><br/>Regarding your <i>Mutants &amp; Masterminds</i>/<i>Champions</i> take on the same module:<br/><br/>I would pull in the same root issues of expectations that Eero nailed down (and that you agree with).<br/><br/>That is, if I as a Player know that this is <i>M&amp;M</i> works, then I know the Villain has those points to spend.

Let's go grab beers because the adventure is over now?</blockquote>\nI feel like giving my point of view, being as how I've been playing in this style lately. In our local culture it would definitely be high fives, a bit of smirking at the adventure, and perhaps a constructive discussion with the GM about adventure design, provided that the adventure was original material. Definitely no big deal for an adventure to end abruptly, and along entirely different lines than the GM envisioned. To think otherwise is, I think, an entirely different game from what old school D&amp;D purports to be; the GM in this story seems like they had been corrupted by new school ideals <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>I mean, that story isn't even particularly drastic in how the dungeon threatens to veers off the rails, when you consider it against the background of free sandbox D&amp;D. For example, just two weeks back we were after a bad wizard who had holed up in a dungeon, not unlike this scenario here; after two failed attempts at ousting him the party chose a two-week delay to gear up with mercenary henchmen, so as to attack the dungeon in force. Meanwhile, the wizard took the opportunity to escape altogether, so that what the party found at the end was a largely abandoned dungeon that they now scoured with their overbearing force. The GM took all this like a man, despite the dungeon never getting to be presented in the supposed standard format: first we were completely beaten and thus could not appreciate the dungeon appropriately, and then we were entirely outmaneuvered, being left to explore an empty dungeon with a force much larger than the one assumed by the scenario design. I have respect for the GM's understanding of his role, as he never showed any signs of wanting to fix either the adversity or our choices to make things run "the way they're supposed to". And of course it would have been a drastic, practically inconceivable (literally that - I can't imagine our GM doing that to us, what with the clarity of creative agenda we enjoy) breach of faith if he had played it in any other way.<br/><br/>Regardless of creative agenda, the above sort of flexible interactivity is what I expect of roleplaying nowadays, and I tend to be horrified by the moral failure when e.g. a GM of an adventure game cheats merely to save their scenario. I am not easily satisfied by one-sided styles of play, I want to encounter people in a powerful manner while playing, whether as a GM or a player. My view of railroading is largely informed by this desire: to railroad is to cauterize your capability for human communication, as one party unilaterally controls and reduces the other side into something comfortable and safe for themselves. It's like keeping a pet instead of art/amusement among equals. (This is, of course, a general artistic observation; there are exceptions of human chemistry and creative goals.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425115/#Comment_425115" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-03T10:24:57+00:00" title="December  3, 2013 10:24AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 3, 2013 10:34AM by komradebob.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Really, to be more fair to him, the GM didn't want us to lose; he just wanted it to be harder for us to win.

In this case, it sounds like what he expected was that a bunch of older guys would play in his crazy trap and monster filled dungeon with high level characters, there would be challenges and maybe even some character deaths, and the thing would end with a big showdown where the surviving characters face down and kill the big bad and glory is had by all.<br/><br/>I imagine he also thought it would last more than an hour of play time and probably had put a whole gob of time and energy into designing it.<br/><br/>Sigh.

(Similarly, in With Great Power, you can't beat the bad guy's plan until you've lost five times.) Where is our agency now? Just at the end of the game when the GM's out of budget (or is really tired and doesn't want to spend any more VIllain Points)?<br/><br/>I get that it <i>feels</i> different to run down a pool of points until you get the guy (or maybe to lose five times in With Great Power before you stop the Plan).  But in reality, outside my heart of hearts, I know I have no more chance of catching the bad guy in the first chapter in the objectionable Champions module than I do in the okay M&amp;M scenario.  If the pace of spending Villain Points is the same as the number of chapters in the Champions module, we might even make identical fictions.<br/><br/>Maybe I have even less chance of stopping the Plan early in With Great Power than I do in the Champions scenario. After all, in Champions there's no mechanic that makes the bad guy get away and the GM might just disregard the text telling them to have that happen...in With Great Power the whole game doesn't really mechanically work unless you start losing!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425167/#Comment_425167" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-03T20:41:10+00:00" title="December  3, 2013  8:41PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Experiences A and B are *definitely* different.

I don't know what to say. You're trapped in the narrative aspect -- but clearly M&amp;M isn't offering that. But it is offering the challenge of working to make the villain burn off points. (The <i>Champions</i> version is offering being puppets on the GM's strings.)<br/><br/>It's the same with Adam's example from his game store experience. Because, that's worth looking at a moment.<br/><br/>Here are the design parameters of that day, apparently:<br/><br/>1) A series of challenges for the Players that can be solved any number of ways that allow the players actual accomplishment by using the rules at hand<br/>2) The challenges are supposed to last X amount of time<br/><br/>Well, let's look at this with clear eyes and realized these are crazy design parameters. Sometimes a game of chess in eight moves, and sometimes fifty. We get this, right? That of course if the idea that the game is supposed to last a certain amount of time the GM might feel his only chance is to alter the challenges on the fly to pad to X amount of time. But, this will blow point 1) of the design parameters. And if people can't see this... again, I don't know what to say.<br/><br/>But it gets crazier! Watch:<br/><br/>1) A series of challenges for the Players that can be solved any number of ways that allow the players actual accomplishment by using the rules at hand<br/>2) The challenges are supposed to last X amount of time<br/>3) Rises to a narrative climax to a final confrontation with the villain<br/><br/>Why was design parameter 3) even added? As Adam pointed out, if the focus had been "Collect Loot" the day's session could have kept going. In this case the High Level Mage would only one of the challenges. But by making him "the end" there's a chance the Players can reach "the end" too soon -- and suddenly everything is over.<br/><br/>Because of "story." What story? This is a design about challenges for the Players. This is why, if you read <i>Lamentations of the Flame Princess</i> you'll see James Raggi sliced off all the XP cruft that's been building since the days of AD&amp;D where story/simulation/challenges all got conflated and you get a muddle like this:<br/><br/>1) A series of challenges for the Players that can be solved any number of ways that allow the players actual accomplishment by using the rules at hand<br/>2) The challenges are supposed to last X amount of time<br/>3) Rises to a narrative climax to a final confrontation with the villain<br/><br/>And that's a muddle!<br/><br/>Look, can those three elements be all sorted out? Sure. With luck and chance, why not? But if you say, "There's enough treasure in this dungeon for each of you to hit the next level... go!" And you do pretty much exactly what that kid did -- without the focus being "Fight the Big Bad for the Climax" -- everybody wins! <i>Especially in the special circumstances of a one shot with strangers at a store</i>.<br/><br/>If everyone wants to argue with me about this point, heads up: I'm not interested. I'm simply looking at this from the point of view of carpenter building a table that doesn't wobble. If anyone wants to get all crazy with fancy joints that they aren't sure will work, more power to you. But that's your <i>choice</i>.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Bonus reading:<br/><br/>Right now I'm reading Raggi's <i><a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product/82999/Tower-of-the-Stargazer?term=tower+starga" rel="nofollow">Tower of the Stargazer</a></i>. It's interesting to read in the context of the example above in that the scenario is:<br/><br/>1) A series of challenges for the Players that can be solved any number of ways that allow the players actual accomplishment by using the rules at hand<br/><br/>And there is a very dangerous Mage in the tower. <br/><br/>However, he's not the climax or what the adventure is leading to. In fact, he's introduced about 25% the way into the dungeon if you go one way, or 50-60% if you travel another way. More importantly, read how Raggi explains the Mage's structural function in the dungeon. Its smart and shows an awareness of adventure design that slips past concerns about "railroading" because there's no need for the GM to panic and slip into railroading. I highly recommend it in general. And I highly recommend it as a parallel design-case in regard to the example upthread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425187/#Comment_425187" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-04T07:17:58+00:00" title="December  4, 2013  7:17AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think the DM in my game was protecting the wizard because of story concerns.

Maybe it's a training session for a new GM, and there's some expectation of "take-backs" for him ("uh, can you guys not go through the walls? can we pretend that there's some magical reason you can't do that? because I am totally not ready for that"). <br/></blockquote>\nRhetorical or not, I'm glad you gave real examples.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425207/#Comment_425207" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-04T09:08:13+00:00" title="December  4, 2013  9:08AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd totally avoid all that jargon with the DM, though.

To me, it was an example of play that was unsatisfying for the players (including me) because of excessive GM Force. <br/><br/>We were pretty nice to the 17-year-old kid running the game at the time.<br/><br/>The best way to analyze play is through actual play examples that went well and some that didn't go well. This one happened to be run by a teenager. If the DM had been a grizzly 60 year-old who'd played since the LBBs, my report would have been about the same. Because the game had an unsatisfying end because of railroading.<br/><br/>Or do you think that playing the way I did, using my character's abilities as I did (and as the DM allowed), was "kicking a younger player and novice GM in the teeth"? If so, I disagree. To me, that's why those spells are there. That's the fun of playing a magic-user in 2E. That kind of creativity is encouraged, even required, in the OSR philosophy. <br/><br/>The GM didn't ask for "easy mode" and he invited us to make up high level characters. I think I didn't know it was his first time GMing until I showed up at the game store with my character (which he asked to look over for approval before play). I didn't realize I needed to go easy on him during play, and I didn't think that going easy on him required playing my character ineffectively. <br/><br/>This is a fundamental difference of philosophy about how to play. If he'd misjudged the encounters and thrown ten kobolds at us and we'd curbstomped the kobolds with just swords and axes, would that have been kicking him in the teeth? Should we have held back some of our attacks so that the game lasted longer? <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425223">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425223/#Comment_425223" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-04T12:21:46+00:00" title="December  4, 2013 12:21PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The players in that situation (new GM, youngest player at the table) have at least as much responsibility for the content and quality of the game as the GM regardless of system. </blockquote>\nOkay, I'll bite. What should the players have done differently?<br/><br/>1. DM invites us to a game store event. Says make up high level characters.<br/>2. We show up with high level characters. I think that's when we found out this was his first game.<br/>3. We play our characters. We're having fun. I'm using my spells creatively and the adventure is going "off the rails," but so far, the DM seems fine with it.<br/>4. We beeline for the center of the complex, which I think was a big pyramid. We guess right and find the artifact we want. I think the evil wizard was already there to protect it.<br/>5. I can't remember if there was a battle or not. I don't think so. If there was, it wasn't going well for the evil wizard. <br/>6. The DM says the wizard tosses up some kind of anti-magic shell. If I recall, it wasn't the spell, because the spell has a limited duration, and he made it clear this was some kind of device, and it's pretty clear he's making this part up on the spot.<br/>7. We say we'll wait it out. He has to eat eventually. Or the air will run out.  <br/>8. The DM makes excuses why that can't happen.<br/>9. There was some general moaning around the table that we weren't gonna get to fight him or get the artifact, but we weren't mean or anything. <br/>10. The game ended there. We thanked the DM and stuff.<br/><br/>But beyond that, why isn't it acceptable to talk about this? It's not like I'm plastering the kid's name all over the Internet or demonizing him. He made a rookie mistake. It's not that uncommon a mistake, or we wouldn't have a common term for it, or hundreds of discussions about railroading and illusionism. Why are we bad people for discussing a game that went badly? Is it just because he was a minor and we were adults?                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Crunch" title="Crunch"><img alt="Crunch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Crunch">Crunch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425224/#Comment_425224" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-04T12:36:06+00:00" title="December  4, 2013 12:36PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 4, 2013 12:38PM by Crunch.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let me get this out of the way first. I'm not saying it's unacceptable to talk about, or that your emotional reaction is or was wrong. I'm not calling you a bad person. <br/><br/>My initial statement, which apparently came off as trolling for which I'd like to apologize, was that I'm glad I don't play with any of you. Here's why.<br/><br/>When I put myself in that kids shoes. Trying to learn to do a new thing that is hard ans scary with an established group of older players. They sit down. They know what they're doing better than I do and they take me apart. No mercy. No "We'll go along with this for now but next time you should think about blah..."<br/><br/>I'm human and I make mistakes. I'm really glad that when I make a mistake with my group (either as a GM, as a player or as a person) they work with me rather than take me apart. I've been in similar situations, with a GM who's overlooked a loophole or exploit (largely as a player, my style even in 2E was largely player driven and improvisational so plot and prep weren't very important to my games), in the same era of play. I'm fortunate that for the most part the response at the table was "Oh hey bob you missed something over there" and then the players figuring out how to make the game work in a satisfying way even if the GM had overlooked the implications of spell X or Item Y when combined with Condition Z. In the world I play (and played in) good games mostly resulted from everybody taking responsibility for the game as a whole rather than just their part of it. <br/><br/>So yeah, I'm glad I don't play with y'all. I'm sorry if that came off as judgey or trolly. It wasn't my intent and I see how it came off that way, so I'm sorry. <br/><br/>But I read that story and all I see is this kid who wanted to share something, and didn't do a good enough job and freaked out. I sort of wish that kid had had the chances I had to work with players who would teach me the mistakes I was making rather than punish me for them. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425227/#Comment_425227" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-04T12:42:42+00:00" title="December  4, 2013 12:42PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think we took him apart!

You keep mentioning that y'all were having fun. Was he? It doens't seem like anyone had any consideration for the GM in the situation. Having someone trivialize something you worked hard on can be really really depressing. Once you figured out that you were smarter than the kid and could bypass the dungeon, what was the point of actually doing so? <br/><br/>Look, I'm not a fan of railroading at all (although I think you can have story, even a story with a probable arc and some scripted events, without either railroading or illusionism) and the kid definitely screwed up. I just tend to feel that the players are as responsible for the GMs fun as the GM is for the players.

Not my thread to police, but I'll happily join another thread to discuss it if someone cares enough to start one.<br/><br/>The play in question was railroading, pure and simple, and it's a common pitfall for new GMs. He was a new GM, sure. Still railroading. Maybe the young GM was feeling stressed and he wasn't having fun. So he railroaded the adventure. And the players there -- some younger than the GM, I will add -- moaned and thought it was a kind of bogus ending and cheat. We all played the game within pretty acceptable boundaries, I think, and the GM seemed okay with it until the end. <br/><br/>Fundamentally, the young GM created a linear dungeon crawl with few choices, and because the group included experienced players, and because the GM had asked us to make high level characters with many potent abilities, suddenly we had ways to turn a linear crawl into something else, and he slammed down hard on that to Force the ending into something more to his liking. Note he didn't make the final encounter harder; he made it _impossible_. He didn't give the evil wizard double hit points and extra fireball damage. He wrapped the evil wizard in a _deus ex machina_ reality bubble and said we couldn't fight him.<br/><br/>I don't know what was going on for him mentally and emotionally. Until that moment, he seemed okay, and even at that moment, he only seemed a bit frustrated and a little petulant. It's not like he was distraught or outwardly angry. Who knows, though, it was a public setting. <br/><br/>What matters /for this discussion/ is the railroad as a useful example of actual play so people can stop talking about theoretical things that could happen at theoretical tables.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425244/#Comment_425244" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-04T15:14:15+00:00" title="December  4, 2013  3:14PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was trying to put water on the fire, not fan it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425245/#Comment_425245" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-04T15:17:51+00:00" title="December  4, 2013  3:17PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I liked the example and I always like this discussion (from this perspective\u2014I get sad when I hear the \u201copposition\u201d).<br/>As I said, the feelings of a younger and beginning DM is somewhat orthogonal to the main thread.<br/><br/>The underlying clash of expectations that caused it isn\u2019t completely irrelevant, though, when viewed as just that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/d.anderson" title="d.anderson"><img alt="d.anderson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/d.anderson">d.anderson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425249/#Comment_425249" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-04T17:29:35+00:00" title="December  4, 2013  5:29PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would like to point out that my intent with this thread was to find the up-side of the things I call railroading and illusionism.

That's the hallmark of dysfunctional pro-character illusionism. The GM has a story, and you pantomime your actions but none of them matter: the story will unfold regardless of what you do.<br/><br/>My young-DM anecdote doesn't address that kind of play. It's more about dysfunctional anti-character railroading. I dare not even call it illusionism, since it was really obvious to everyone that the DM was cheating.<br/><br/>If we want to talk about good railroading, let's talk about participationism, by which I mean lots of thinly veiled GM force that the players have consented to beforehand (perhaps tacitly). <br/><br/>My own 1E and 2E games in the late 80's were modeled on the advice from Gygax's "Master of the Game" and other prominent authors' advice to manipulate players like puppets in the interest of fun. A lot of what I did was classic illusionism. Over time, my group and I came to an unspoken understanding that they wanted a certain amount of script immunity, and I provided that through hidden Force (tweaking encounters on-the-fly, mostly, but also a lot of "all roads lead to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Rome</span>the adventure") and a fair amount of not-so-hidden Force (allowing rerolls and second chances to escape certain death).<br/><br/>Certainly, to succeed in those games I ran, you had to know how to work the system. You had to be able to make a convincing argument to get a second chance. That involved arguing a case that convinced me AND the other players without being too annoying. We had rules lawyers, con men, and politicians at the table. How much of that does it take until the social game you're playing is the focus, rather than the D&amp;D game?<br/><br/>By and large, our table was mostly functional, with some notable exceptions. There was a core group of 7-8 players besides me, plus a handful of others who rotated in now and then. We played mostly every Friday for three years of high school and had a great time. There were some extremely dysfunctional moments, though. Some huge arguments when characters died. One was when the thief thought he could take on a bear by himself, and died quickly, and he wanted a second chance because he felt I was wrong about (or had described poorly) some aspect about the bear's weight and size. Another instance was a fight between characters (and players), and the player of the losing (dead) character never returned. There were a couple attempts at getting girlfriends to play, and us making rule concessions to suit the women, but really, none of those women played more than once.

As I mentioned up thread, I wanted to dig through some text and find material that pointed to railroading and illusionism.  I found a ton.  I am missing some great examples because I am limited to stuff I can dig out quickly and scan- specifically I would really like to compare 1st and 2nd editions of D&amp;D DMG, the first printing of Vampire and the Revised, 1st edition Shadowrun, and 2nd edition GURPS, because those were the heavy hitters for my play experience, but I don't have them handy anymore, so I took a smattering from what I do have.  I also focused on 'play advice' and especially on gm advice, because those were easy to find, but there are two categories that I think might be as or more relevant- text that captured some of the culture of play (e.g. letters column and the editorials in Dragon magazine), and (I'm having some difficulty finding my phrasing here) the way mechanics of the game established parameters of authority (what Vernon said a few posts above, where as a player you have defined abilities you expect to rely on to achieve you goals or deflect undesirable consequences; there are analogs for the gm role I think).  With the caveat that analysis of text probably fails to capture some important qualities of actual play, here I go.<br/><br/>First.  I dug through Men &amp; Magic, and Monsters &amp; Treasure, and didn't find much of anything.<br/><br/>The next texts I had that helped are from 1981: The Keep on the Borderlands, and Aftermath.  KotB has long been a favorite of mine even when I was anti-old school play, and I have lots of fun stories of wacky emergent play when we used it in 2nd edition.  It is a great text, because Gygax hisself wrote it as a beginner's guide to play, and I think responds to common misunderstandings that had become clear after the early days of rpg-ing.  There's a lot of prescriptive anti-railroading advice; here are my favorites:<br/><i>&gt;! Just as the referee of a sporting event, the DM must be fair. He or she cannot be \u201cout to get the players\u201d, nor should he or she be on their side all the time. The DM must be neutral. If a party has played well and succeeded, the DM should not punish them by sending more and more monsters at them or thwart their plans; on the other hand, if the players have acted foolishly, they should get their \u201cjust rewards\u201d. In combat, the DM should play the monsters to the best of the monster\u2019s ability. If the creature is stupid, it may be easily tricked or may not always do the smartest thing. If the monster is clever or intelligent, it will fight to its best advantage. The DM must be fair, but the players must play wisely.<br/>&gt;! Is it possible for a good player to win, yet still be a challenge and a risk in doing so? Is the amount of treasure gained equal to the danger of trying to get it? As DM, much satisfaction comes from watching players overcome a difficult situation. But they should do it on their own!<br/>&gt;! Again, he or she must be fair - telling the party what it can see, but not what it cannot. Questions will be asked by players, either of the DM or of some character the party has encountered, and the DM must decide what to say. Information should never be given away that the characters have not found out - secret doors may be missed, treasure or magic items overlooked, or the wrong question asked of a townsperson. The players must be allowed to make their own choices. Therefore, it is important that the DM give accurate information, but the choice of action is the players\u2019 decision.<br/>&gt;! The DM is the judge, and it is his or her game. The DM should listen to the players and weigh their arguments fairly when disagreements arise, but the final decision belongs to the DM. The Dungeon Master\u2019s word is law!</i><br/>Much points to what is now called the old school style of play, but it also seems clear that serious admonitions had become worth writing down in general.  Aftermath has some pretty explicit talk about expectations of play, and whose fun it is anyway:<br/><i>&gt; Sometimes the Players miss the clues and walk right by the opening of the scenario. A creative way to nudge them into the correct approach can usually be improvised. Failing that, the Gamesmaster always has the option of pointing out the error to the Players. Again, some Players take one look at the horrifying prospect presented by the scenario\u2019s beginning and decide they want no part of it. This can cause problems, and often occurs early on in a Campaign, before the Gamesmaster and Players are at home with each other. This leads us to the whole question of Player enjoyment. <br/>&gt; (under 'Enjoying Things') The touchiest situation in Player-Gamesmaster relations arises when the Players can justly complain that the Gamesmaster is being unfair. Not in the sense that \u201cFate\u201d is unfair when random events plague their Characters, but that the Gamesmaster is deliberately fudging things so that the Characters lose (i.e. die during adventures). The converse is equally ugly: when the Gamesmaster suspects or proves that somebody among the Players is deliberately cheating.</i><br/><br/>The next is from the Skyrealms of Jorune Sholari guide, 1985:<br/><i>&gt; The Sholari is like a storyteller telling a story, except that not all the characters are under the Sholari's control.  The Sholari's stories will develop with time, adapting a bit here and there to fit in with the actions of the players.<br/>&gt; Don't despair when someone is unhappy about the fate of their character.  Take a break for pizza.<br/>&gt; Lastly, the Sholari will be spending time outwitting players who come up with ridiculous schemes for 'winning.'  Those who try to 'win' at fantasy roleplay games suffer from the misconception that exploiting loopholes in the rules is the purpose of gaming.</i><br/><br/>Torg Adventure Book, 1990:<br/><i>&gt; The rules allow you to decide if actions succeed or fail; sometimes, as we've mentioned before, the rules get in the way of the story.  This usually occurs during those scenes when, for dramatic reasons, the heroes must succeed or fail in order to tell a satisfying story.<br/>\u2026 At these times you must use your power as gamemaster to come to the rescue of the adventure.<br/>\u2026 Remember, this is 'cheating' in favor of a satisfying game, not to victimize players or benefit one over the other.  Dramatic failure is always acceptable, but random, senseless failure is not.  However, never let your players know this. To keep the dramatic tension, they must believe that their characters can fail. Otherwise, why play? Use your gamemaster prerogative sparingly.</i><br/><br/>My favorite, Kult, 1993:<br/><i>&gt; If you focus on role-playing and are less concerned with skills and combat, you can virtually ignore the rules.  The Gamemaster can decide freely what happens in different situations..<br/>&gt; Don't leave the train of events up to the players.  They will choose their own leisurely pace, and that's always too slow.</i><br/><br/>I'll mention one more, Return to the Keep on the Borderlands, 1999, written with a similar intention as the first, to introduce new players and gms to roleplaying (2nd edition D&amp;D):<br/><i>&gt; When running a pregenerated adventure such as this one, remember to be flexible.  Players have a habit of doing the unexpected; resist the temptation to force them to follow a particular track.</i><br/><br/>This probably needs an edit, but I need to get dinner going.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425328/#Comment_425328" name="Item_118" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-05T15:48:28+00:00" title="December  5, 2013  3:48PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 6, 2013 10:41AM by jhkim.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><b>Christopher Kubasik</b> wrote:<br/><br/>That is, if I as a Player know that this is <i>M&amp;M</i> works, then I know the Villain has those points to spend.

I haven't played Mutants &amp; Masterminds, but I did play James Bond 007 where villains have Survival Points that sound very similar. <br/><br/>I wonder - is this <b>only</b> possible with mechanically Villain Points being checked off? What if, for example, a Champions GM made clear to the players that they wouldn't be able to beat the villain in the first scene - but if they boxed him in again and again, then the GM would notice and respond to that, so after a number of tries he would expect and allow the villain to be defeated for good. <br/><br/>This would potentially allow some nuance that might not be had in the case of burning Villain Points. For example, if the players did an extra-good job of boxing in the villain, the GM might consider that more heavily than if they only just barely boxed him in. Also, it could have tailored consequences - so sometimes the villain just gets away by luck, but sometimes he might have to burn a valuable resource or gadget to get away. <br/><br/>Does the fact that it isn't objectively measured in points mean that this is still just GM whim?                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425338/#Comment_425338" name="Item_119" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-05T16:52:21+00:00" title="December  5, 2013  4:52PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 5, 2013 4:52PM by David_Berg.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>I'd love to hand every new GM a "how to railroad" and "how not to railroad" pamphlet, with an instruction to discuss with their group before picking one.</blockquote>\nSomething like the <a href="http://bankuei.wordpress.com/2010/03/27/the-same-page-tool/" rel="nofollow">Same Page Tool</a>?<br/></blockquote>Definitely the same sort of idea.

As I think I explained upthread, as far as I'm concerned the crucial issue is the mismatch between GM actions and player expectations. If the GM explains to you and gains your acceptance for the fact that fights in this game aren't to the knife, then all well and good, doesn't sound like illicit use of extra-systemic authority to me. For this reason there isn't any significant difference for this topic in whether a villain's escape is regulated by currency of some sort, an on-the-spot judgement or the phase of the moon. As long as it's consensual, it's systemic (in the Lumpley sense), and therefore not particularly contentious as far as I can see.<br/><br/>I mean, it'd be a pretty weird opinion for anybody to hold that other people are playing wrong because their game is arranged differently from your own. I would expect that most of the discussion around railroading/illusionism very much concerns the situations where the GM is lying to the other players, or misleading them implicitly, or fudging, or whatever name you want to give to the practice. That doesn't really have anything to do with consensual game structures except that sometimes GMs lie about rule X and instead implement rule Y, and then there might be some other group somewhere that actually plays rule Y openly, so those two groups might sort of seem similar, even if in one play is illusionist and in the other it's not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_425426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/contracycle" title="contracycle (Banned)"><img alt="contracycle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/contracycle">contracycle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425426/#Comment_425426" name="Item_130" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-07T04:35:35+00:00" title="December  7, 2013  4:35AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My question is this: is a GM allowed to have any creative input at all?<br/><br/>Because all this hyperbole about GM's snatching agency and fun out of the players hands suggests that the only viable way to GM is as a kind of menial servant, a human computer, only less than an actual computer, because people don't BLAME computers when they do something they dislike.  When a human does exactly the same things, it's seen as personal, vindictive, malicious.  And you know what?  I don't want to play a game in which I can only be a servant, and one on whose head blame is heaped when the players don't have their every petulant demand met.<br/><br/>So this is how things go. You're running old school, you're drawing dungeons on graph paper, the players are butchering kobolds and orcs by the mass grave, and you start to think to yourself, actually this is all rather dull.  I'm doing a lot of work to arrange this stuff, but I don't get to have much of the kind of fun that players do.  I don't get to talk in character, portray interesting people, I'm just a number cruncher.  Whats more, none of this masss monster-cide has much relevance to the source material, there's nothing Tolkien or whatever about this, there is in fact... dun dun dah!... no STORY here.  So  you start to fiddle with things that are a bit more complex, instead of just a random hole in the ground you set up something with some meaning, and like so many stories, you think the players would perhaps like to engage with some sort of personal nemesis.  Ands then <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=1129" rel="nofollow">this </a><a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=1134" rel="nofollow">happens</a>.<br/><br/>Which is perhaps not surprising given the prevailing dungeon crawler's ethic is: if it moves, kill it and loot it.  But it is neverthless a problem.  So you start to take measures to make sure it doesn't happen again, and when that starts getting ridiculously obvious, you start to get cunning, and to mask the setup so that it does not intrude into the fiction.  So that it's elegant, naturalistic, in tune with the setting and tone.  This of course takes even more thought and work, and yet the thanks you get is to be told that you're spitting in someone's drink.<br/><br/>Nobody throws a hissy fit when a computer tells them the only direction you can leave town in is towards the dungeon, but when a person does it it's a mortal sin and evidence of your tyrannical character.  And yet, practically speaking you cannot have that total freedom, because setting thigs up for play takes time and effort, there is only so much of it you can do, especially if you're working hard to make it thematic and evocative.  And yet, every fucker wants to be Luke Skywalker, they all want to decline the call to adventure, and the look in their eyes says "go on, MAKE me have fun, I dare you".<br/><br/>Now maybe you'll respond to this and say, this problem is solved, by means of GM-"full" games, by distributed authority  The creatively frustrated now-ex-GM can set aside the creative responsibility and take part as a player.  And if that works for you, great.  But it doesn't work for me.  I don't think that great works of art are casually improvised in the moment.  I think they require thought, and planning, and development.  I've read many, many actual play accounts of these improv'd games, and none of them have really struck a chord in me.  They lack structure, content.  This is of course a preference, and I'm not saying that those of you who enjoy this sort of thing should not; nor am I saying that I really think the stuff I've made actually constitutes "great art".  But I certainly think that the application of an artisinal approach, the effort to create something that worked as a form of storyTELLING, the careful construction to canalise play toward deliberately crafted events, has created FOR ME, and indeed for many of my players, something more than we would have achieved with "mere" improv.<br/><br/>And thus I bitterly resent all this personally vindictive slander that is so casually slung around.  I'm not denying that there are many people out there who have tried to do this sort of thing and fumbled it, badly; whose execution has been inept and unsubtle, whose techniques were crude and "dictatorial".  But I do NOT think that even you have had this kind of experience, that entitles you to assume malevolent intent.  And yet it is that assumption that effectively prevents any further considertion of the form, or ways to improve techniques, or design that facilitates this sort of approach.

Then they started outside the dungeon I had prepped, a 10 story cube-thing still half-filled with seawater washed up near Fishgut, a local fishing village.<br/><br/>I had already jotted down a rough map, some thoughts on the monsters and problems within. I knew they were going to go into the damned thing because Into the Odd is about explorers who go into strange places. I didn't prep a problem in Fishgut or anything like that. If the players had avoided the dungeon, I would have played a while and then asked if they wanted to play something else.<br/><br/>Our Monday night Lamentations of the Flame Princess game is about the players hunting monsters through the Adventurers and Salvage Union of Marsui. Taking the place of a wizard in a tavern witha  quest is their union rep, Humberto, who put 3 or 4 monsters who had lairs in the city in front of them and they chose one. I had maps printed out and vague ideas about each one.<br/><br/>This is entirely different from the way I play BW, in the players come up with characters that confront a campaign-sparking situation and I riff off of their beliefs, instincts, traits, affiliations and reputations (but mostly the beliefs). <br/><br/>Which is entirely different from the way I run DW, where I like to run a pre-packaged adventure, then go home and make up Fronts inspired by that.<br/><br/>And that is different from how I run AW, where I throw the shittiness of the apocalyptic world at them and go make fronts after that fruitful and inspiring first session.\ufeff<br/><br/>That said, if the players had looked at the cube and not gone in at all, I would have stepped out of game and asked some hard questions about why they had agreed to play a game about explorers with crowbars. <br/><br/>Both of these games, the LotFP game and the Into the Odd game will grow beyond these dungeons after some time but until it does through organic at-the-table, free-range play, we'll kill monsters, take their stuff and see where the campaigns go. When things pull hither and yon, I'll go with it but until then, let's do this. If the players were avoiding adventure, I wouldn't have dogs attack until they went where my prep was. I'd ask them what they wanted to do and hope it was interesting. If the random encounters and the consequences to their non-dungeon actions didn't get anywhere, I'd step out from behind the metaphorical DM's screen and ask what was up.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425428/#Comment_425428" name="Item_132" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-07T06:32:18+00:00" title="December  7, 2013  6:32AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I take it that Gareth's players enjoy witnessing the great work of art - if this is the case, I can sort of understand where this is coming from. As has been discussed here exhaustively, sometimes being on the rails is something you can want and enjoy. Perfectly understandable, although my own experience (and this might be simply because I started with railroading and arrived at other styles later, instead of vice versa) has been almost the opposite: I grew entirely bored and despaired with the dusty, stultified forms of railroaded GM plot and pretensions at literary grandeur, and thus embraced the opportunity to make gaming exciting and interactive again. Of course I have not stopped exploring the auteuristic alternatives, those techniques and agendas do regularly come up for new examination in my play.<br/><br/>As for vindictive slander, I suggest not taking it so personally: it is totally the case that many of us have had bad experiences with this kind of play (the worst clearly not being when a GM simply controls plot - no, you have to actively lie and mislead to really rile us up), and we do not like it, but this is not slander <i>against you</i>, it's just how we experience this playstyle. Picking the strongest words used so far, I can totally say that a GM who <i>lies to me</i> in the interest of his great art is, metaphorically, spitting in my drink. Maybe he thinks that it'll make it taste better, and I guess I won't mind as long as he doesn't get caught in the act. I think that I can say this without it preventing anybody from exploring the form - grud knows I've had worse said of my playstyle on the occasion.<br/><br/>That aside, I'd like to say a few words about a game called <i>Dread</i>, by Epidiah Ravachol: here we have a game that is predicated on railroading (in the technical sense of having a GM plot and whatnot), but it is also a game that I like and do not find socially poisonous, simply because it is very open, very explicit about how it is formed. The biggest thing it has going for it is that it doesn't give the players complex skill lists and synergetic combat systems, with a false implication that gaming these subgames somehow matters; thus it actively encourages participationist play in lieu of illusionism. My understanding is that nobody can play Dread and think that it's <i>not</i> about experiencing this carefully orchestrated piece of literary art the GM has created for your delight.<br/><br/>Going by the example of Dread, are we capable of using terminology that clearly separates the issue of creative betrayal from the issue of pre-plotted gaming? I ask this because it seems in hindsight that despite everybody being even-headed individuals here, it seems that we're spending much, much too long talking at cross-purposes. I mean, I'm pretty sure that people like JD and Gareth who actively play GM-plotted (for more than just experiment's sake, like I do) specifically don't engage in creative betrayal, or at least they don't think they do, so all this about lies and subterfuge will rightly seem to them like it's slandering what they see as a noble arrangement. Simultaneously we have a bunch of people who've never encountered a participationist railroad where the players know and at least implicitly accept that important parts of the game are predetermined; they don't know that this is possible and important to many people, and thus they end up conflating railroading, illusionism and creative betrayal. (Yes, all three are different things - you can even have illusionism without betrayal as long as the players are willing to be lied at for the sake of the experience.)<br/><br/>As an initial suggestion, I'd like to posit that "railroading" is when PC freedom is curtailed by GM subterfuge or illegitimate force in an adventure game without explicit player accord. The term should't be applied to a game that does not promise certain types of freedoms in the first place, nor is it applicable when the players agree to make certain choices or whatever. This is the original, historical railroading, whether for good or ill: it's when you think you're playing D&amp;D, but then you see the rails when the GM plays an illegitimate move.<br/><br/>Furthermore, "illusionism" is when a player (the GM, that is) plays by different rules than others, giving procedural impressions that do not apply. So when the GM uses a quantum ogre in a game where you think that he's using a simulation or heuristic, that's "illusionism". "Participationism" is when similar techniques of railroading and illusionism are used with overt player knowledge.<br/><br/>Finally, as the final piece of this little terminology clarification/revision tour, I suggest that we should call it "social betrayal" or "creative betrayal" when somebody betrays us in game by cheating in their responsibilities or in executing the rules or whatever. Thus, when a D&amp;D GM fudges the dice, he might be doing "railroading" (if he's doing it to prevent some consequential, legitimate outcome in favour of some other one), "illusionism" (if we think he doesn't do that) or "participationism" (if we know that he does that), and we still don't know if he's actually <i>betraying</i> the group in a way that causes resentment without also knowing a lot about what the other players are expecting of him. If it's the sort of game where the players will just nod along and congratulate the GM for a good game when he reveals later that he really fudged through all combats - well, good for that group, I say!<br/><br/>The specific advantage I am looking for with this terminology clarification/revision is this: I want to tell JD and Gareth that while I do not personally like railroading or illusionism, I am a little bit intrigued by participationism, and I could never imagine resenting these guys for playing the way they do. However, if somebody betrays me creatively in a game by lying to me about the game we're playing and then playing a different game (or equivalently when I'm the one explaining the game: lying to me about how they're executing the game I teach them), that's a genuine cause for anger for me. I can even get a bit miffed for the sake of your players if you now come about and tell me that yeah, you're actually advocating active betrayal, that's the way to go with your friends - I don't think that this is what you're telling us about railroading, of course!<br/><br/>I hope that clarified something, and perhaps eased the feeling of social pressure that the railroading minority is feeling in this discussion. I am genuinely surprised if we have even one participant here who would actually want to to cause you to feel bad for your style of play - as far as I can discern, we have a bunch of people who are discussing their own experiences with railroading, and sometimes that might seem like they repudiate the practice as an objective moral issue, but I am confident that this is not the case: everybody I've read so far has reserved their moral condemnation for people who lie to other people about the games they play, as far as I understand the matter. They repudiate "creative betrayal", not "railroading" or "participationism" per se.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425429/#Comment_425429" name="Item_133" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-07T06:59:18+00:00" title="December  7, 2013  6:59AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 7, 2013 7:23AM by komradebob.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Somewhere in here is also an unfortunate problem of just how hard-core is the gamism supposed to be really, even in a supposedly gamist game?<br/><br/>Perhaps I'm wrong about that, but I doubt it.<br/><br/>Edited to add:<br/>I think somewhere there's also a question of gamer-culture in there.<br/><br/>On one hand, you have stuff in texts of RPGs talking about player characters being able to do whatever they want to do.<br/><br/>Generally, that's only semi-true. How true it is depends a bit on the PCs at least engaging the core activity of the game concept at least initially ( especially at the beginning of a campaign). Like, if a group gets together to play Call of Cthulhu, you're supposed to make investigators who investigate an occult mystery and follow it up for quite a distance. Poking at the weirdness a couple of steps, then pissing off to the Bahamas to become rum-runners is pretty much not what the thing is about.<br/><br/>So, "PCs can do anything" is supposed to be about players being able to try stuff that a human being ( or whatever) could attempt, within the core concept of the game itself. It's a comparison to the limitations of boardgames or more standard wargames, not truly an ability to do anything at all. I suspect that's not well discussed or understood in many cases where issues of railroading come up.<br/><br/>I do recall an interview with someone, Dave Arneson maybe, talking about dungeons being partly invented to keep players from completely wandering off from the main concept of play on exactly those grounds.<br/><br/>Then there's an issue of a "promise" that some sort of story will occur. Well, okay, it might be story in the sense of  recounting of events after the fact, but pretty much everyone encountering RPGs expects at least a bit more than that. The question partly becomes, by what method does that happen?<br/><br/>Railroading and illusionist methods come up at least partially as a response to that. They may not be good methods, but they did come about for a reason. They're early tack-on methods to pretty simplistic gamist games and come about when, from what I can tell, people are trying to get RPGs to do all sorts of things they really aren't designed to do. So already, there is a clash between the available mechanics and the goals of the players ( including the GM).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425431">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425431/#Comment_425431" name="Item_134" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-07T07:52:56+00:00" title="December  7, 2013  7:52AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It has been a great blight upon the history of rpgs that the first notion that came to define the form was that players could not talk about their hopes and wishes towards the game openly. This goes particularly for the GM, the poor thing has nobody to complain to as long as you subscribe to the auteuristic model of play. Throw out your players and get ones better able to appreciate your genius, indeed.<br/><br/>It's not even like a gamist game somehow makes it impossible to coordinate play without lying, no matter how hardcore serious gamism it is. In our OSR D&amp;D group, for instance, we have been playing through the <i>Stonehell</i> dungeon for the last couple of months. Whose idea was that - the GM's, he told us that he's being a bit busy with work and studies, so how about we specifically go delve Stonehell instead of doing the normal free hexcrawl content negotiation thing? It'd be easier on him, as he wouldn't need to do as much set-up for the winter's gaming. Lo and behold, thus was agreed and it was done, and I've yet to detect any drawback to talking honestly about what we want to do in the game. Specifically, in this enlightened age, it would have been mostly amusing if the GM had attempted some ham-fisted railroading scheme to accomplish his Stonehellish desires...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425432/#Comment_425432" name="Item_135" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-07T08:40:47+00:00" title="December  7, 2013  8:40AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>My question is this: is a GM allowed to have any creative input at all?</blockquote>\nSure you can, but in cases where the game master's role isn't above the players.

They're early tack-on methods to pretty simplistic gamist games and come about when, from what I can tell, people are trying to get RPGs to do all sorts of things they really aren't designed to do. So already, there is a clash between the available mechanics and the goals of the players ( including the GM).</blockquote>\nTo which I must take exception, specifically trhe allegation that they are "not good methods".<br/><br/>Lets split somethings apart here.  As some of you will no doubt recall, I hate the causal use of the term "story" because it can mean so many different things.  Forge-style Narrativism hones in like a laser on one particular aspect of, or meaning for, that term,  and that is the address of premise.  This view, not at all ureasonably, argued that the real core purpose of stories, what makes them engaging, is that they present some kind of moral or ethical dilemma for consideration, and then, in the conventional mode of storytelling, the author delivers an opinion, a resolution, of some kind.  The appropriate form, therefore, of a multi-participant medium is to eliminate the didactic component, the role of the TELLER, and to present the moral or ethical dilemma as one which the players present solutions to in play.<br/><br/>This is a wholly credible and internally consistent way of looking at things.  But it is not the only way in which story can be considered.  Because there are other elements to story, not least of which which being that of "mere" entertainment, in which want you mainly want is to sit back and hear the story of Beowulf for the umpteenth time, or whatever.  In this view, the whole premise thing is not so much the point of the exercise, as it is a device.  It is a tool for making the story more than just a sequence of events, making it engaging, entertaining, making it worth listening to, putting a bit of juice into the dead dry bones.<br/><br/>And from this I suggest it follows that strong and affrimative GM authorship is NOT inherently contradictory to story, or even a "poor" form of story.  It is certainly a different beast from the active address of premise, but it is not "invalid" as a form.  It is quite possible that your real interest lies somewhere else; that you choose to engage with stories/play about Japan and samurai because you happen to be a nipponophile, or want to explore this historical context, in which case the whole premise element is USEFUL but still remains SECONDARY.  And if, or more accurately when, that is true of a group of players, then it is not in any way trampling on their feelings or expectations for the GM to take that pemise element into their own hands and deliver a calculated, developed experience that delivers what the players really want: to be transported into an alien context.  In this appraoch, "story" is just a tool, a sort of lubrication that makes the exercise more approchable.<br/><br/>Thus, I utterly reject the idea that "railroading", and even less "illusionism" are poor methods.  They are perfectly good methods for delivering a certain type of "story", and they can lay every bit as credible a claim to being valid forms of story as Forgite Narrativism can.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/d.anderson" title="d.anderson"><img alt="d.anderson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/d.anderson">d.anderson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425459/#Comment_425459" name="Item_141" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-07T18:32:45+00:00" title="December  7, 2013  6:32PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Gareth!  Thanks for joining the discussion.  I am sorry for whatever portion of the antagonism I can take responsibility for.  I certainly have strong feelings against my experiences of railroading and illusionism, but my posts have been intended to explore positive aspects and learn some of the historical basis thereof.<br/><br/>Your point, upthread, that certain valuable play experiences could only really be achieved through using these methods, is echoed heavily in the 'Beautiful Railroad' thread linked to earlier.  It is a hard sell for me!  I can't think of anything I would want to achieve, running a game, that wouldn't be better served using some other approaches/ techniques/ methods that facilitate more input from the other players, and certainly as a player I'd rather be confident I was playing a game where I could accomplish goals, using the character created, though I admit I prefer to work with the gm to those ends.<br/><br/>Increasingly, I am reading many of the texts that are anti-railroading as trying to prevent gm dickery, and the pro-railroading ones as trying to prevent player dickery.<br/><br/>All that said, I would like to point to my original post and say that these things seem to be on a scale, where techniques and methods I find useful or even necessary (e.g., hard scene framing, establishing situation) sit squarely on one side of my line of 'acceptable,' are not that far away from things on the other side of the line.

One minute ago, when I realised the plan wasn't working and needed to be adapted?  I might raise my hand to making a mistake, but to <i>dishonesty</i>?  I don't think so.  That's something that happened in your head, not mine.</blockquote>\nIt is certainly something that happened in my head, that's what I've been saying in this thread since the beginning: broken <i>player expectations</i> are the root of the vituperation. Nobody would blink an eye if they sat down to play a game that they knew would be railroaded, it's only disappointment with overly large expectations that causes resentment.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if your questions are rhetorical, but in case they're not, I'll explain a bit more about what I understand the psychology of the reactions to be - why it becomes contemptible to mislead me about the nature of the game we play.<br/><br/>Why I have a right to my resentment as a player, that's mostly because of the traditional power arrangement: the GM is the one who knows the rules, who explains the game, who <i>defines</i> the game. If he portrays it to me in a way that makes me think that I have more freedom than I actually end up having, it is not surprising if I blame him. And this is actually historically what happens, it's the GM who gets blamed when his railroading becomes obvious. I have never, ever seen anybody except JD (who is pretty strange. for all that we love him) even suggest that you should blame the inflexible store-bought scenario the GM is running - whoever externalizes their responsibility as a GM to that degree? Every group I've ever played in considers it the responsibility of the GM to not run the bad scenario, he's the one who's actually read the piece and knows whether it's worthwhile to play.<br/><br/>Besides, there is the fact that there are styles of play where the ogre indeed only had 40 hitpoints. Your refusal of all responsibility would be more convincing if the railroading methodology were somehow inevitable, but history quite, entirely clearly proves that this is not the case. Both old school D&amp;D and Forgite games are excellent examples of how you can construe of a roleplaying game, even a traditionally construed adventure game, without illusionism. Neither of those types of game are obviously right for all situations, but basically that's where the resentment comes from: a player thought that they were getting a free strategic exercise or a central role in creating a story (both of these can be perceived as the fundamental issue behind many old, pre-Forge accounts of railroading experiences - they are historically existing expectations that rpg texts have encouraged, often to the detriment of poor GMs who are supposed to fulfill these expectations), but instead they get to go on a (rail)road trip.<br/><br/>I don't know if there's anything further to say on the point, really. I think that what I'm saying here is not very controversial: people get angry when they feel that they've been misled, and they get angry when the foundational premise of their activity is sabotaged. Doing a railroad when the players are expecting a much more equitable division of labour, even when such equitable divisions have not really been technically developed yet (much of the '80s-'90s was sort of spent in this state: rpg texts and the mythology of the hobby promised much, but delivered little), is prone to make people angry at the guy running the show. I can empathize with this sentiment, it doesn't seem weird to me at all. The solution is to not mislead and pretend to more god-like powers than you have. Even just saying clearly at the start of the session that this adventure I've prepped deals with the subject matter X, let's please engage that instead of doing something else, will go a long way towards aligning player expectations with what the GM factually wants to and can present to them.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_425468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/contracycle" title="contracycle (Banned)"><img alt="contracycle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/contracycle">contracycle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425468/#Comment_425468" name="Item_145" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-08T03:19:22+00:00" title="December  8, 2013  3:19AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, Eero, I understand that people get angry when they feel decieved.

One game just had characters with a handful of stats running from "poor" to "excellent" in 4 steps, and that was it - no dice, no turn structure, no maps, nothing.  The basic format was that I would narrate something and then jab a finger at a player and demand a response from them.  The outcome of everything they did was judged purely by me, using their "stats", such as they were, as a guide.  And this worked perfectly well, and in fact the players enthused about it, because not having to check sheets and make rolls and whatnot meant that everything could be maintained at a high pitch without interruption, creating a very visceral sensation of "being inside an action movie".<br/><br/>I wouldn't do it again, though, because running a virtual simulation in your head for so long is brain-meltingly hard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425476">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425476/#Comment_425476" name="Item_147" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-08T12:33:15+00:00" title="December  8, 2013 12:33PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Yes, Eero, I understand that people get angry when they feel decieved.

However, your characterization does not account for the model of play that the players expect, are promised, or have internalized. For example, in the sort of clarified hardcore gamism that we've been doing with D&amp;D lately it would be totally, utterly wrong to say that imagining something in a slightly different way (meaning, in a way that does not accord with the game's ordinary processes) is somehow forgivable. The game has its procedures, you play by them or you cheat. You even do this if you think that it's dumb and it just makes you a machine slave of the players (I do not, obviously think this; there are plenty of ways to contribute intelligently without railroading) - you don't have to play that kind of game, of course, but if you do, you're obligated to play by the rules. Saying that it was just a slightly different way of imagining the ogre when you gave it that crucial extra 5 HP would be complete bullshit in a game of that nature, if you did it against procedure, small change or not (e.g. to make it last one more round in combat).<br/><br/>So it's not correct to say that this or that exertion of GM powers is small or inconsequential as an universal measurement, it all depends on the style of game you're playing. If you play some game where the nature/rules/system of the game allows a relatively free hand to the GM in certain ways, and you choose to exercise those freedoms, then no problem. In some other game those freedoms do not exist, so exercising them regardless is cheating, and perhaps cause for a pretty harsh judgement from others playing the game. Claiming that some cheating is so "small" that it doesn't matter is like saying that you can put some extra stones on the Go board, it's so big and there are so many, who's gonna mind one or two extra...<br/><br/>For this reason it's simply wrong to point at some merely fictional detail and say that of course changing that won't hurt anybody. Maybe in one game, maybe not in some other one. As far as I understand, the big railroading issue tends to generally be that players expected neutral fairness, but what they got was directed GMing. It's much less common to hear about players who accept GM plots, yet object to some specific railroading behavior - they're accepting of railroading already, after all.<br/><br/>Maybe you've encountered a lot of players who get frustrated at railroading without justification: you get the players together, you tell them that this is gonna be helluva railroaded, put on your conductor hat and start play; then the players completely unreasonably get angry at you. Maybe so, and I would agree with you that that's unjustified frustration on their part - they knew what they were getting into. But as you can see, I'm again getting back to the question of player expectations: indignation can only be righteous when you have, in fact, been deceived as to the nature of the game. It all depends on what has been agreed upon, and not, like you suggest, upon whether the things the GM does are large or small. Historical problems with railroading would probably never gotten to be so severe if we didn't have such a bunch of game texts encouraging misleading players about it. "Let them think that they're really struggling, but don't hesitate to fudge a dice roll here or there to make sure everybody ends up happy."<br/><br/>Of course the entire issue if whether somebody is justified in being angry is somewhat spurious to my mind. We're no longer talking of what you or I think about things, or even about the mechanics of achieving happiness of gaming - we're talking about, I don't know, morality of holding an opinion, I guess? I'm not really convinced about there being a witch hunt going for dastardous auteur GMs anyway, so perhaps this doesn't seem as important to me as it should.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425478/#Comment_425478" name="Item_148" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-08T13:29:42+00:00" title="December  8, 2013  1:29PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there's a strong case for illusionism going hand-in-hand with strong Simulationist play.

Why keep the players in the dark about it, when everyone knows that they want the GM Force there to keep things going in the Right direction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425479/#Comment_425479" name="Item_149" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-08T13:57:03+00:00" title="December  8, 2013  1:57PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Why keep the players in the dark about it, when everyone knows that they want the GM Force there to keep things going in the Right direction.</blockquote>\nEveryone doesn't know, which would be the key problem.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425480/#Comment_425480" name="Item_150" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-08T14:04:20+00:00" title="December  8, 2013  2:04PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's a historical accidence, frankly: roleplaying matured out of D&amp;D in a way that retained certain promises made to the players about how the authorities are shared; you play and control your character's actions, I respond with the world. "Adventure" as a structural concept specifically posited many other assumptions: a PC party, a mission, dangers preventing accomplishment, player choices upon which everything hangs in balance. When you bring a GM wanting to "do story" into this mix, however else could he approach the matter than by hiding what he's doing from the players? The players are wedded to that "I play my character, you play the world" mindset, they're expecting for the combat mechanics and skill mechanics and whatnot to matter, they're used to the thrill of seeing how everything hangs on one dice roll... how do you explain to them that no, you'd rather want to just tell nice stories together?<br/><br/>I think this historical context explains it entirely satisfactorily why railroading methodology and other participationist mechanics initially appeared via subterfuge, and have only slowly since come out in the open (largely as a by-product of the crumbling of the cult of the GM: more people switching between the GM and player roles, more critique towards auteuristic genius mythology of GMing, etc.). Illusionism was first because the players were not ready for the kind of play the GMs wanted at first. As Gareth says: a certain sort of GM will grow bored out of their skull if they can't "do Lord of the Rings", so it's pretty natural a progression for them to attempt to achieve this by subtly influencing play. Contemptible to me as an adult (I don't think it's OK to treat other people as objects of your desires, if I may channel Immanuel Kant a little bit here), but understandable as something that would emerge, especially when there really isn't any clear and explicit social contract on play anyway - if the GM is king as Gygax suggests, then why couldn't he as the king build his own secret kingdom between his screen?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19027/hey-contracycle-railroading-illusionism/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19027/hey-contracycle-railroading-illusionism">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19027/hey-contracycle-railroading-illusionism/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19027/hey-contracycle-railroading-illusionism/p3">3</a><a class=" p-4" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19027/hey-contracycle-railroading-illusionism/p4" rel="next">4</a><a class=" p-5 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19027/hey-contracycle-railroading-illusionism/p5">5</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19027/hey-contracycle-railroading-illusionism/p4" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F19027%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F19027%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Hey, contracycle!

When you're stuck GM'ing under those expectations, you do your best to drag the game round to what everyone wants however you can, even if you have to obscure how it happens.<br/><br/>I've been in positions where every player round the table at different times played as GM and railroaded when they did so. The issue couldn't have been that those players didn't know railroading was happening on a macro level - it was that the only way to deliver with those rules, after all. The issue was that on a micro level the only way to do it was to pretend that each particular roll was happening freely, even when it wasn't.<br/><br/>I suggest that it's not the cult of the evil GM that causes this behaviour in all cases, or even most. It's that there was a mismatch between where everyone wanted to get to, and our skill/tools to get there, combined with an inherent ambiguity in the rules about what was possible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425482/#Comment_425482" name="Item_152" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-08T14:30:43+00:00" title="December  8, 2013  2:30PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps it's not a sufficient explanation, although I did not intend any particular antagonism - merely that the scene had expectations and hopes in cross-purposes, and game design answered this by making the player rules ("roll dice against these numbers to make shit happen") and GM rules ("plan cool shit and then narrate it to the players in an appropriately paced literary sequence") of games increasingly separated from each other, attempting to simultaneously satisfy both urges and thus make story "magically" emerge without players having directly anything to do with it.

To put that latter point simply, I'm interested in non-auteuristic systems of play because they allow me to play different games instead of the same game with different settings. I can totally understand how somebody less interested in the game part of "roleplaying game" and more interested in the infinite variety of literary possibilities would not be bothered by this lack of a particular kind of variety - they've got all the other sorts of variety to consider, after all!<br/><br/>More generally, though, I think it's a pretty credible claim that publishing rules in rpg books at all has at times been a commercial consideration more than a creative one. Some authors have even been explicit about considering rules-based play a lesser form of roleplaying that one can discard once level of skill increases. Fair enough, although I have to say that I haven't been too impressed by the rules design of these same people, so it is possible that they've just been in the wrong line of work all along.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Crunch" title="Crunch"><img alt="Crunch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Crunch">Crunch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425490/#Comment_425490" name="Item_157" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-08T16:28:02+00:00" title="December  8, 2013  4:28PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Perhaps it's not a sufficient explanation, although I did not intend any particular antagonism - <br/></blockquote>\nHow do you not mean to antagonize when you describe something as "contemptible."

I have also never seen a game attempt to <i>help</i> the GM run the show without also roping in a bunch of player-facing stuff that gets in the way.<br/><br/>In my eyes, this is not failed design space, but rather unexplored design space.<br/><br/>Here's a project I'm working on:<br/><br/><span style="color: #003399;"><b>Mead Hall Tales</b><br/><br/>To be played at house parties, perhaps during meals.<br/><br/>One person is the Bard, composing and delivering a tale to everyone else.  The Bard can be the host of the party, or just someone appointed by the host to be the evening's entertainment.<br/><br/>Before the story-telling begins, the Bard presents the characters in their story, with each person at the party claiming one.  Each character has a Talent and a Supremacy.<br/><br/>The Bard begins the tale, as the party-goers do whatever else they feel like, so long as they're not making it hard to hear the Bard.  Coming and going, eating, quiet chats, are all fine.<br/><br/>The Bard narrates what all of the characters do.  However, whenever an audience member wants their character to do something else using their Talent or Supremacy, they interrupt and call for the die.  The Bard then walks over to them and hands them a d6 to roll.  Talents succeed on a 5-6, Supremacies succeed on a 3-6.  On a successful roll, the person who's claimed the character in question gets to narrate an outcome other than what the Bard described.  This narration cannot cover anything beyond the immediate action and result.  <br/><br/>If the Bard's story requires the characters to be trapped, and one character's Talent or Supremacy prevents this, then the Bard will simply have to find another way to trap them.  The idea is not for the audience to control the story, but rather to stand up for visions of their characters.</span><br/><br/>This is highly specific and probably isn't fun in all the ways in which Gareth's game was fun, but I think it works as an example of the possibilities RPGs haven't probed yet.<br/><br/>Perhaps it isn't commercially viable, but whatever, that goes for plenty of games that are still getting made.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425492">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425492/#Comment_425492" name="Item_159" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-08T16:43:40+00:00" title="December  8, 2013  4:43PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>I think the trick with this style of play is that we havent really been able to put in words yet what enjoyment the player is getting out of it and that has really hampered the ability to describe the playstyle without ruffling the feathers of those who do enjoy it.   I played this way a fair bit in the late 80's/early 90's and for me at least I think that when it worked it worked because of the illusion.  We wanted to believe that play really did flow from the characters choices and actions and that it wasnt being manipulated by someone behind the DM screen.  I dont think of it as a nasty trick where someone was trying to pull the wool over our eyes rather it was like going to a magic show where you know there is some kind of trick going on but you want to not know how the magician did it.  We never thought that it wasnt the GM pulling running the show but we didnt want to see him pulling the strings.  I think that is where this playstyle can be functional and fun for the participants when it's not functional is when the strings start to show, like in Adams game when the players could see the gm twisting the rules of the game whereas a better GM could have simply moved the location of the wizard and made it seem like he was one step ahead.                            </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425493/#Comment_425493" name="Item_160" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-08T16:51:54+00:00" title="December  8, 2013  4:51PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 8, 2013 4:55PM by David_Berg.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Vernon,\n<blockquote><b>We wanted to believe that play really did flow from the characters choices and actions and that it wasn't being manipulated by someone behind the DM screen.</b></blockquote>In that circumstance, here's a job for the players:<br/><br/>1) If a moment in play arises which shatters your illusion, speak up to repair it.

A lot of posts in this thread have discussed a vile hatred of any GM that would do ANYTHING that would force a players hand to do anything but I have not played in nor have a run a single game which if it didn't force the players to do a particular thing, then it went one further and EXPECTED COMPLETE COMPLIANCE from the players to do a thing.<br/><br/>If an old man walks into a bar and asks for a group of adventurers and you don't go... who's the asshole now? The GM for expecting you to do it?  The players for refusing to play the game they asked the GM to run?<br/><br/>It seems kinda rude to get mad at the GM.  But, if you're not ok with that level of railroading and the players are completely right to REFUSE to be controlled by the asshole GM who (god forbid) assumed they would want to go with the old man, then you win.  But that's not how this hobby works.  We ARE here to be part of the GM's story.  Some GM's are better and allow more choice or are better at hiding the forced parts of their story but at the end of the day the contract between gamer and GM is that I'm here for a game that the GM will run.  That's why I go with the old man as cliched as it is and I contend that you're a dick if you don't go with the old man. Of course it could have been handled better, but he's GM'ing for you... just go play man.<br/><br/>So... being ok with the GM forcing you to go with an old man is the same as being ok if the orc has 5 less HP for a cinematic kill or 5 more HP so his reinforcements can get there.  It's a forcing action to put the story where you want it and it's not lying or being reprehensible.

There's a lot of loaded language being thrown around by the side of this argument that wants to demonize the GM. </blockquote>\nUsing "loaded words" is not the same as attempting to antagonize people. It is true that in the trollish Internet cultures the reverse is often true - people attempting to antagonize others generally use words that they know will cause others to jump to stupid conclusions. This does not take away our right as honest conversationists to use exact terms and say what we mean, even if those same words might have become some sort of triggers in other contexts. If you want to get antagonized, please rely on the content of my message and not merely the choice of words.<br/><br/>I hope that I did not describe anything as contemptible (worthy of contempt, and I stand by the choice of words) except lying to your friends and betraying their trust. I think that it is contemptible to cheat in games, and it is cruel (and therefore contemptible) to intentionally betray the trust of friends. I think that I have also tried to draw a careful, ever so careful distinction between merely railroading a game, and doing so without permission (even implicit) of the other players in the game. I have continuously assumed that nobody who likes railroaded games actually conceives of their practices as socially transgressive, but rather that they merely think that everybody knows that GMs fudge and mislead, but it's all implicitly accepted as part of the illusion. Like stage magic, not like a conman; the responsible stage magician nowadays does not encourage mysticism, they will openly admit that their show is in reality a bunch of harmless social hacks and clever tricks, but that they encourage the audience to pretend otherwise for the moment to get better kicks out of the mystery. I don't see anything wrong with an illusionist GM performing under similar social contract.<br/><br/>As far as I am concerned, the only reason to discuss the moral facet of the matter is to distinguish between railroading and actual moral failings, which I think are separate matters. I think that you can do railroading and illusionism without moral hazard, but as I described upthread, there's been a lot of vague terminology in this discussion, and that seems to be causing confusion, making railroad-advocates think that they are being personally attacked or condemned morally.<br/><br/>I would not even be discussing the line between moral and immoral gaming (which I personally think lies in the murk between your friends being willingly performed for and your victims being misled about the core nature of the game) if this mutual misunderstanding didn't make it necessary. I say mutual because I've not seen anything in this thread (excepting maybe Accounting's recent contribution above, although to me it seems that he's toeing the exact same line I am by acknowledging that it's the implicit permission of other players that might make certain types of lies acceptable in illusionist play) from either side that would actually surpass being simple differences in taste; one side is discussing how they haven't liked railroaded games and how they think it's wrong for the GM to lie to players, and the other side is discussing how they like railroaded games, and how they resent that their railroading is being called wrong. Thing is, nobody called ralroading wrong (except "wrong for me"), the wrong thing was lying (from which category we might as well remove mutually acceptable misleading - not the thing we mean here, really). That's how I understand the discussion so far, anyway.<br/><br/>I mean, I can't believe it - are you guys really saying that you defend not only preplotting games, but doing that against the will of the other participants of the game? What sort of friends are you, or do you only play with victims? If this is the case, we have much, much bigger differences about gaming than just technical matters of like whether it's a good idea to preconstruct plots and setpiece scenes. I guess that's not impossible, I have encountered my share of strange and transgressive ethical standards in gaming. (Pervasive larping comes to mind, adherents of that ethically risky gaming strategy apparently genuinely hold different moral standards from mine.)<br/><br/>Also, if there is somebody here who thinks that railroading <i>sine qua non</i> is actually morally or socially contemptible, please do by all means correct my impression that nobody here thinks that - I am actually not being useful in this discussion if my repeated claims about the standings of the respective parties are mistaken. I've read a lot about personal preferences here, and about people who've gotten angry with GMs who have broken social standards by lying or cheating, but I haven't understood anybody to object to the bare gaming technique of having the GM maintain a plot by directly herding players towards the correct direction. It might not be my thing, but it's not morally wrong, and I will be genuinely surprised if somebody wants to take the extremist position here.\n<blockquote>I have <i>never</i> seen a published game present to players, via text <i>and</i> rules, a role that is truly compatible with "GM runs the show". I have also never seen a game attempt to help the GM run the show without also roping in a bunch of player-facing stuff that gets in the way.</blockquote>\nCheck out <i>Dread</i>, which I mentioned upthread. I find it a pleasingly progressive piece of writing in this regard. It is also notable how it ultimately finds that it is not necessary to micromanage conflict resolution for this sort of game, as long as you have general control over scene framing, and do not write your plot points to rely on any individual PCs doing something or surviving through the entire story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425520">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425520/#Comment_425520" name="Item_170" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-09T03:18:59+00:00" title="December  9, 2013  3:18AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It seems kinda rude to get mad at the GM.

(Apocalypse World comes to mind.)  That doesn't mean that players aren't implicit with going along with crumbs the GM might lay down. ("There's a large explosion from the quarter of the hard hold where your domicile is. What do you do?")  Even participating in these exchanges is still going along with the GM with something he's laying down.  Maybe it's a railroad he's making up as he goes along but if you have ever "gone to investigate" anything the GM puts before you.  You rode the rail.  There isn't a difference between something I JUST made up and something I made up and wrote down in my notebook a week ago.  <br/><br/>The only kind of RP that I've played where railroading isn't an option is GM'less games which don't really count in this discussion, because I'll agree that GM'less games are not at all railroady.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425523/#Comment_425523" name="Item_172" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-09T04:19:47+00:00" title="December  9, 2013  4:19AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 9, 2013 4:21AM by AccountingForTaste.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I say mutual because I've not seen anything in this thread (excepting maybe Accounting's recent contribution above, although to me it seems that he's toeing the exact same line I am by acknowledging that it's the implicit permission of other players that might make certain types of lies acceptable in illusionist play) from either side that would actually surpass being simple differences in taste;</blockquote>\nYup, that's an accurate interpretation of what I'm saying.

You are of course correct in noting that GM subterfuge may have either explicit permission or implicit permission from the players, so it's not as simple as just looking at some rules text or whatever. This still goes under my umbrella concept of player expectations, though: relying on implicit permission to mislead the players in the interest of better game seems fine to me as long as you're actually correctly interpreting that implicit permission.<br/><br/>Of course we know now that relying on these implicit feelings can be a big problem. We can actually see it in this thread as well: we have people here who seem to defend their play not by the simple expediency of their players wanting it that way, but with some sort of greater social appropriateness theory. Like, one might say that railroading is cool because everybody does it, or because that's what roleplaying is like. That seems to me like something you wouldn't really need to say if you were actually correct in assuming that your players like being railroaded - it's a defense you take up when your own player undermines you, getting angry at what you're doing. Against strangers, what defense do you need anyway, except that you're playing as the group desires.<br/><br/>Although I would not desire to deny anybody their fun with implicitly permitted railroading, I would be careful about doing that myself in this day and age. We have such different, rich rpg cultures all around, that I truly couldn't expect to know in advance what sort of game a new player wants. And from my viewpoint that convetionalized defense strategy ("everybody's doing this, so if you have a problem you're a jerk") does not seem valid, so I couldn't rely on that. I would rather talk it out straight, even if that means shattering some dearly held illusions about the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_425534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/contracycle" title="contracycle (Banned)"><img alt="contracycle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/contracycle">contracycle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425534/#Comment_425534" name="Item_177" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-09T07:33:48+00:00" title="December  9, 2013  7:33AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Becuase it's NOT ENOUGH to say you are playing as your group desires, because people still casually call it "toxic".

I'm simply pointing out that every time a GM puts something in front of the players for them to play off of he is influencing and controlling their actions.  We're on board with that because we want to play the game.  Games that have player generated setting are STILL capable of being railroaded.  I ran an AW game a few weeks ago that CERTAINLY had a lot of railroady elements.  I dangled an interesting thing in front of them and they went for it.  I wasn't even so honest as to have a man ask them to go.  I straight up MANIPULATED them into going where I wanted them to go.  I made it interesting. I made it align with what they wanted and I promise you they had less choice than in even the most RAILROADED game ever. In a GM's game, it's all controlled.  It wasn't an ACCIDENT that what you do aligns with your characters motivations.  It wasn't a FLUKE that you wanted to save the NPC who professed love for your character before.  I'm MANIPULATING YOU as your GM.<br/><br/>A GOOD GM does that... and it feels natural.   \n<blockquote>Most of us seem to have experienced the latter at one time or another, where indeed the entire game is a railroad because <i>all</i> the truly important choices are predetermined by the GM.

There's a reason for that.  When I make my decisions as a GM I take into account my players and when I want them to go somewhere or I want them to do something I dangle my carrots and hit with my sticks until they do it.  Those guys didn't HAPPEN to chase you... the McGuffin didn't HAPPEN to fall into the clutches of the villain.  I CHOSE that.  You BOUGHT that and we're in MY adventure.  Next time you make any decision in an RP, ask why you're doing it... I"ll bet something the GM told you has something to do with your reason.  I don't think my players would say that my games are railroads (For one thing I don't do prep and I play off of player generated answers to questions) but I'm pushing them and pulling them with the things I make happen in the world.  In real life... things happen.  In an RPG... when things happen... it's because the GM made it so.  I make them WANT what I WANT.\n<blockquote>The other thing you did which I object to was make a false comparison between an old man in a tavern and an ogre having 5 extra HP.

We may just have to agree to disagree  on this point.  I think  that the problem is not one of railroading but breaking social contract.  If your groups social contract is that all enemies will be as printed in the book then BOO on the GM  (Also... I dont' want to play that game at all). That's breaking social contract, but we're talking about railroading which is about controlling player decision. My argument is that in every game, the GM is controlling the player decisions at key points.  Sometimes I'll just throw things out there and see what they do, but when it counts I pull out everything I can and make them want what I want.  I can't think of a single module or game I've played where EVERYTHING that contributed to the reasons I did ANYTHING in a game didn't come directly from the GM.  <br/><br/>So.. I'll agree.  Breaking social contract is bad.  Different problem entirely.<br/><br/>Railroading is all around us!  It binds us!

On the other hand in a different game like Gareth's where it's a game about badasses fighting their way through tough opposition and getting away mostly because of their badassness it's totally ok to bump up the hit points on a foe if the battle goes to easy because you're not a badass if you are just pushing over a bunch of wimps, you have to take out someone damn tough to be a real badass.  No lying, heck it sounds like in the system Gareth was using there may not have even been mechanics that determine when the baddies fall it was all gm fiat.<br/><br/>So being clear on agenda seems to be the big thing.  If people know that the gm isnt cheating and that death is on the line if they dont play smart then the players wont have their characters try and act like action heroes and conversely in an illusion game when the players think they've come up with a brilliant plan to take the enemy by surprise they shouldnt be pissed off when miraculously the villain had planned for just such an event and has an army they have to battle through.  The second does require a certain amount of self-awareness on the part of the player and it does go against the self deception that is inherent in the style of play.  I think that can work against David's 'Mead Hall' game above or his idea of challenging the events of play when they break the illusion.  Of course the downside of this is that you put a heavy load on the GM to try and get that feel right in every moment of play and not step outside the illusion.

My friends fortunately know this about me. You can see how this social courtesy maps to implicit vs. explicit permission to railroad: if you want to throw a party, you either should know that the target will enjoy a surprise (implicit permission for illusionist techniques), or you should ask them in advance (explicit permission for illusionism, or even participationism). I would find it pretty rude or thoughtless or self-centered if somebody threw me a surprise party and forced me to engage with that sort of thing just on the presumption that everybody likes it.<br/><br/>I think it's a sucky convention (American such, I think - at least here in Finland a surprise party would be beyond the pale in all except the most Americanized circles) to expect the victim of the party to just suck it up and have fun just because it's a "party" and therefore anybody can be forced into such or they're bad friends and party-poopers. I assume that something along these lines is behind Gareth's example - that parties are inherently good and therefore this is a reductio ad absurdum by analogy? Doesn't work for me at least, as I evidently don't find a party to be an inherently good thing.<br/><br/>(The above should not be interpreted to say that I would ruin your party. If I cared about our friendship, I would presumably merely grimace and bear with it, and talk it out afterwards in private.

Primarily, in that the enjoyment of a surprise party does not depend on the choices of the guest of honor. The enjoyment of a Gamist play session depends heavily on the choices of the players.<br/><br/>At a lot of gaming tables, there is a social contract that players are making choices that matter. In challenge-based groups, illusionism is toxic because the players derive enjoyment from the game via overcoming obstacles through their actions. If it turns out that their actions weren't what caused them to win, those players are going to be annoyed. To use another imperfect analogy, it's like learning that your favorite athlete was juicing; it invalidates all the games that team won.<br/><br/>And, mind you, some people hate surprise parties. My wife, for example, told me never to surprise her with a party because she doesn't want to be caught off-guard without the proper attire and such. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Golux" title="Golux"><img alt="Golux" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Golux">Golux</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425543/#Comment_425543" name="Item_185" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-09T08:04:05+00:00" title="December  9, 2013  8:04AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Brian,<br/><br/>What do your players contribute to the story when you GM? </blockquote>\nI go around the table and ask <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19054/question-theory#Item_2" rel="nofollow">questions.</a>  I will ask questions to the players to define key NPC's.

Like the example where an old man walks into a tavern and asks for a group of adventurers to go kill the dragon is a railroad.  The players have no agency in this.  Their choice wasn't REALLY theirs. They went and did what the old man asked because the GM obviously spent some time and we should go see what he made.  We're not acting with any agency when we go where the old man tells us to go.<br/><br/>For the same reason when the players tell me they hate Dorgan and that he's a little shit I put them in a scenario where they followed him because they wanted him to fail in a deal he was making.  They found out because I told them what he was doing.  They went because they hated the guy.  I KNEW that and laid down those rails as surely as if I had made it up weeks ago.  They went because I BUILT a scenario where they wanted what I wanted them to want.  They got railroaded.  I didn't have to betray our social contract.  Betraying social contract isn't the issue here. They went because I lay more subtle rails.  Being a GM is ALL about playing with motivation and character drive. I don't run games where an old man shows up and says he needs a group of adventurers to slay the dragon anymore because I'm better at disguising my railroading.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425549">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Golux" title="Golux"><img alt="Golux" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Golux">Golux</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425549/#Comment_425549" name="Item_190" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-09T08:28:41+00:00" title="December  9, 2013  8:28AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 9, 2013 8:29AM by Golux.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I dont see the railroading, or if there is any it's pretty mild. </blockquote>\nBut it's still there.

There are a few cases in this thread and the other one talking about railroading done with all the best intentions. <br/><br/>However, my argument remains the same: If you know your friends want you to use hidden GM Force to make the game a certain way, then it's probably participationism and not illusionism. If you're truly doing illusionism for a long period of time, why not have that conversation with your friends at some point.

At all.<br/><br/>Illusionism...? Maybe. If I squint. But even then, what I read was you providing Bangs (as I know them from <i>Sorcerer</i>) except in an "adventure"/combat sensibility. You're providing situation and danger and color and having them make decisions about how they'll respond moment to moment.</blockquote>\nI don't see how you can miss it.  Everything happened as I planned it to happen.  The proof surely is in the pudding, which in this case is that I chivied the players right to my pre-planned final set-piece.  There were no bangs, because a bang as originally articulated is a motivating event without any expectation as to how the player would respond, but I had very firm expectations as to how the players would respond to the pressure I was applying.\n<blockquote>But the Players see all that up front and are onboard with it. So, three's no manipulation.</blockquote>\nOf course there is no manipulation.  My whole point is to challenge the idea that GM-directed play like this is manipulative.  I think the whole argument is circular in this regard; these labels don't really describe any actual technique of play at all, instead all they do is apply a label to something because the person doing them is suppposedly thinking bad thoughts.  And therefore it is no wonder that the conversation is all over the place and confused, because the terminology is not describing anything concrete, but instead relies on moralistic condemnation of an alleged/imputed state of mind.<br/><br/>I claim that railroading does not come about because the GM want's to be manipulative, but to make a better experience for everyone.  And Illusionism is just subtle, skilled, elegant railroading.  And yes, it may well be that this was a bad choice when the players involved wanted to "make meaningful choices", but it cannot be assumed that is what all players want... and yet, that is absolutely implicit in the identification of railroading and illusionism as "manipulative".  And seeing as these techniques have been slandered as tantamount to RP's original sin, they receive no discussion, no exploration, no technical development.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_425560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/contracycle" title="contracycle (Banned)"><img alt="contracycle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/contracycle">contracycle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425560/#Comment_425560" name="Item_197" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-09T09:04:24+00:00" title="December  9, 2013  9:04AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 9, 2013 9:07AM by contracycle.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>However, my argument remains the same: If you know your friends want you to use hidden GM Force to make the game a certain way, then it's probably participationism and not illusionism.

Because that's the AP that I had at my fingertips. That's the example I used to discuss my own experiences.<br/><br/>Again, I'll point out, that maybe you don't need to be debating with me, because I think illusionism as a technique serves Sim play pretty well, but participationism serves it even better.<br/><br/><br/><b>Definitions and Jargon stuff</b><br/><br/>The thread might need to agree on some definitions. I've been using the <a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/_articles/glossary.html" rel="nofollow">Forge definition</a>:\n<blockquote><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Illusionism</span>: A family of Techniques in which a GM, usually in the interests of story creation, exerts Force over player-character decisions, in which he or she has authority over resolution-outcomes, and in which the players do not necessarily recognize these features. </blockquote>\nI've been drifting that definition a little to remove the word "necessarily" and assume that players do not recognize the hidden Force. Participationism is Illusionism where the Force is not hidden. I think the Forge definition of Illusionism includes Participationism, where it's slowly drifted as being distinct.<br/><br/>Also note that, by the Forge Glossary, "Railroading" is /by definition/ against the social contract. If you control a player's outcomes in a way that isn't against the social contract, then the Forge definition doesn't count that as railroading. I'm pretty sure the common definition of that term has drifted from that (or never was that in the first place).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Golux" title="Golux"><img alt="Golux" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Golux">Golux</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425564/#Comment_425564" name="Item_200" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-09T09:23:38+00:00" title="December  9, 2013  9:23AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Sorry I dont think that's railroading, not even the old guy in the tavern asking if they want to go kill a dragon.

My whole point is to challenge the idea that GM-directed play like this is manipulative.  I think the whole argument is circular in this regard; these labels don't really describe any actual technique of play at all, instead all they do is apply a label to something because the person doing them is suppposedly thinking bad thoughts.  And therefore it is no wonder that the conversation is all over the place and confused, because the terminology is not describing anything concrete, but instead relies on moralistic condemnation of an alleged/imputed state of mind.<br/><br/>I claim that railroading does not come about because the GM want's to be manipulative, but to make a better experience for everyone.  And Illusionism is just subtle, skilled, elegant railroading.  And yes, it may well be that this was a bad choice when the players involved wanted to "make meaningful choices", but it cannot be assumed that is what all players want... and yet, that is absolutely implicit in the identification of railroading and illusionism as "manipulative".  And seeing as these techniques have been slandered as tantamount to RP's original sin, they receive no discussion, no exploration, no technical development.</blockquote>\nBravo!<br/><br/>I agree wholeheartedly!

In a Gurps campaign I play in the GM will set out a bunch of possible adventures and we are free to pick and choose which ones we go on.

Because there seem to be a few different ways to interpret that.<br/><br/>If someone asks me whether I want a peanut butter and jelly sandwich or a turkey sandwich, that seems like it could be a meaningful choice (especially if I'm vegetarian), even though in both cases I am eating lunch, and it's going to be a sandwich either way. That I can't choose to eat spaghetti or roast duck or zucchini or a lightbulb instead doesn't make that choice less meaningful. Hell, even if I pick the PB&amp;J and they say, "Sorry, we have no peanut butter, but you can still have turkey," my choice was still meaningful on a personal level, and my lunch experience is now different (tinged with regret, or surprised that I like the turkey so much, or suspicious that they're just hiding the good peanut butter because they're mean).<br/><br/>Sometimes I think that this thread is using "meaningful" as just another way of saying "effective": that when I say PB&amp;J, I get PB&amp;J and not a substitute. Does that mean I also have to be able to choose what kind of bread gets used, what brand of peanut butter, what flavor of jelly? If I pick the PB&amp;J and get something I strongly dislike but which still fits the definition of a PB&amp;J, was my choice effectively taken away from me? Do I need to know all the details ahead of time before my choice can really be meaningful?<br/><br/>But meaningful implies some specificity and personal intent with it, so obviously having some details is important; if I don't know what I'm choosing, maybe it can never be a meaningful choice. If I flip a coin to decide between sandwich A and sandwich B, it's a choice, sure, but one I barely participated in. Someone else could have flipped that coin. They could have flipped it weeks or months ago, for all the difference it makes.<br/><br/>Or is meaningful defined by the larger significance of the choice? If I choose the turkey sandwich and it uses up the last of the turkey so no one else can ever have any, that still makes turkey a very meaningful choice, even if I genuinely don't care what kind of sandwich I have.<br/><br/>Meaningful might also be a numbers game. It might be a more meaningful choice if I have more specific options available to me, or if I can just choose whatever I want, with or without any context. If I have to choose from someone else's list, maybe that's less meaningful than what I would choose if it was entirely up to me.<br/><br/>I honestly don't know what the answer is. I suspect that there isn't really an answer at all, that it varies from individual to individual and from choice to choice.<br/><br/><br/>Speaking only for myself, I think that in general I don't need to know all of the details ahead of time, but I like to know the broad strokes: if the adventure is to the east and there's nothing but monsters to the west, I'd like to know that. And after I've made my choice, I don't like being blindsided with something terrible and inappropriate. I typically don't care if my decision has a larger significance to the story -- I get as much or more pleasure from a choice that only affects how I perceive my own character (does he feel good about this, did he get here by design or by accident, is he being honest or deceptive, etc.). The number of options doesn't much matter to me, although I often prefer having some options to having complete freedom. And I hate it when I make choices in a game that are then overridden capriciously or maliciously; if I can't really choose that thing, I'd be happier if it wasn't even offered to me in the first place.<br/><br/>And it's that last one that really makes my railroad-sense tingle; it's well over the "someone is pissing me off" line.

In that game, tactical play is not as meaningful to them as getting it all "Right," and there might be some agreement that the rules are a poor simulation sometimes.<br/><br/>If the players are jonesing on Gamist play, then they probably care a lot about the outcomes of their tactical choices. Those choices are the reason they play the game, so invalidating them makes their play meaningless.<br/><br/>Note that a Sim GM who invalidates player choices in a way that does not serve The Dream (in "Right to Dream" / Sim play) will quickly have a table full of confused or grumpy players, too. It's just really hard to do this in an Illusionist way, because of the nature of Sim reinforcement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425581">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425581/#Comment_425581" name="Item_209" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-09T12:25:21+00:00" title="December  9, 2013 12:25PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 9, 2013 12:32PM by David_Berg.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey!

Do not say, "I can tell you fudged that, GM, so you should make it right." Instead say, "That first seemed odd to me, but I think I can make sense of it." Then do your best, and the rest of the group (GM included) will help.<br/><br/><b>2)</b> Get your <b>thespian</b> on and make the illusion impactful by showing the passions of the characters inhabiting it.<br/><br/>The <b>fun</b> for the players, like in most games, is performing and excelling at their jobs. "I get to act and add drama, and I get to help make the world and story seem real."  The <b>meaningful choices</b> are how you go about this -- will I lean in, glare, and grind my teeth to express my character's reaction?  Or will I judge that my character truly loses his sit, and start yelling?  Can I come up with a natural-seeming explanation for an event that initially seemed contrived?<br/><br/>Plus there's the more passive audience-style type of enjoyment too.<br/><br/>What do you think?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_425584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/contracycle" title="contracycle (Banned)"><img alt="contracycle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/contracycle">contracycle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425584/#Comment_425584" name="Item_210" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-09T12:37:18+00:00" title="December  9, 2013 12:37PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 9, 2013 12:40PM by contracycle.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (xposted with David, this in response to Adam)<br/><br/>Yes that's fine.  But the whole idea of railroading as initially discussed rested on some pretty concrete examples that prompted the coinage of the term.  Stuff like the GM blocking player choices as to direction, forcing players to accept quests, providing special protection for favoured NPC's, disabling character's weapons and powers to compel them toward some action, or having a hero NPC sweep in to save the day.  We've seen examples of those cited in this discussion.  This is why a lot of people were vehemently against any attempt to construct "story" in play, and for a long time on places like rpg.net, the formulation of Narratavism, address-of-premise play, was violently resisted and denounced as railroading.<br/><br/>My argument is precisely that none of these things is inherently contrary to the players interests in the specific circumstances where the group agenda is suitable.  That the early discussions in which the term was coined should now be re-examined in the light of what we now understand of agenda conflicts.  That in fact the preservation of the term and it's negative connotations has the deleterious effect of discouraging examination of the circumstances where the use of any of those things above might actually be useful and good.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425586/#Comment_425586" name="Item_211" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-09T12:42:24+00:00" title="December  9, 2013 12:42PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>David,<br/><br/>That's a better wording of it then you had it earlier and it might work.

Basically, it takes two to make an illusion.  No GM, no matter how slick, can sneak <i>everything</i> past players who are trying to catch them in a mistake.

But the thing about social contract is the GM is never going to try something that he thinks is a breach, it's only a breach because the contract hasnt been set out well enough for the participants to know what they are agreeing to.  The GM is doing these things thinking he not only has the right to do these things but that it's his responsibility to do these things or else the game will not work.   Traditionally gm's and players havent wanted to admit that deception and manipulation is going on because admitting it spoils the illusion that it's all real and that we are doing it together.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/summerdown" title="summerdown"><img alt="summerdown" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/summerdown">summerdown</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425596/#Comment_425596" name="Item_215" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-09T14:09:58+00:00" title="December  9, 2013  2:09PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>How's this?<br/><br/><b>The player's role is (1)</b> express their character, adding resonance, depth, meaning and drama to the GM's events, <b>(2)</b> invest as audience in seeing the GM's plot unfold, <b>(3)</b> if needed, help keep the experience running smoothly.<br/></blockquote>\nHow about: In addition, the GM's role is:<br/><br/>(4) Express the world, adding resonance, depth, meaning and drama to the setting.<br/><br/>(5) Invest as a fan of the players by listening to their input and trying to build on it.<br/><br/>(6) Regularly ask for feedback about whether the techniques in use are acceptable.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425599/#Comment_425599" name="Item_216" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-09T14:40:37+00:00" title="December  9, 2013  2:40PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure, there are some parallels.

Great idea!<br/><br/>Ok, maybe I'm too late to contribute here, but here's my two cents:<br/><br/>When I started GMing neither I or my players knew anything about railroading. I didn't had the chance to read D&amp;D modules until lately but I learned how to GM by playing with a friend who despite having learned probably with such material or WoD stuff, was quite flexible. Also, some of the players were used to things that now I clearly see are quite railroady.<br/><br/>Anyway, after burning out from GMing with tons of illusionism and prepping hard for sandboxes, I went for a while with one-shot games with dirty hippie indie concepts on them and did a terrible job trying to improvise my way out of the last campaign I GMed.<br/><br/>I was confused right at the middlepoint between two bad tendencies (at least for me):<br/>-Prepping too hard for a campaign and then defending my material through tons of illusionism had the effect of stressing me out, even when my players would be quite supportive and go collab if found out and asked them nicely.<br/>-Prepping too little and winging it resulted in poor scenes and keeping cohesion alone was proving to require such an effort that creating memorable scenes wasn't something I could accomplish anymore as a GM. Not that players couldn't do the work (we had some good moments in that campaign after all) but I felt my portraying of NPCs wasn't doing too much impact, that they become too flat. I ended up reusing NPCs from previous campaigns who already had made an impact in the players, but felt cheap doing so.<br/><br/>So, after the campaign ended, I talked it out with the players, took a recess from GMing, processed the burn out, read a lot about may other games and experiences I concluded that:<br/><br/>-Without prep, it's harder to give your players better NPCs, interesting challenges, memorable performances and a more firm frame for them to take meaningful choices.<br/>-With too much prep, it's easier to fall in the mistake of trying to protect it somehow by railroading, fudging and cheating. On top of that, is easier to burn out.<br/><br/>So I ended up hacking several games and mechanics that allowed me to improvise better and more creative stuff, setting up a few simple but interesting mechanics for players to add more input to the game, and a whole method to make my prep nicely but with less investment, so I don't fall in love with it and feel better about "looking at it through crosshairs". Because after Trust, for me this is a problem of Investment. Players are invested in their characters and their choices, whatever they are about. When the GM's fiat affect those choices, it affects the players in the same measure of the investment they have done so far.<br/><br/>OTOH, whenever players choices affect the GMs plot, it affects her in the same measure she put investment on the prep, so the more she improvises, the more she's willing to look through crosshairs, unless she learns to let go for now and recycle that prep for later. But that doesn't make it easier to accept a whole day of work is being thrown trough the window by a move improvised by a player in less than a minute.<br/><br/>Anyway, I believe the "Investment" part of the problem can be solved with many things:<br/><br/>-A system that allows the GM to create interesting NPCs, monsters, places, items and even whole situations on the fly. (random tables help a lot here, but my favorite solution so far has been <a href="http://resourcefullrpg.wordpress.com/2013/02/14/latest-version-of-the-resourcefull-deck/" rel="nofollow">this one</a>.<br/>-A game where creating interesting characters takes less than 10 minutes (right now I can create a simple one in two minutes and engrane it with the whole setting/PCs in 5)<br/>-Modular Prep: I prep only the beggining of interesting scenes, and at that, scenes that don't specifically need to be in any order, these are just interesting things that happen or that players find out that happened some or a long time ago, when they get to a particular place or meet a particular NPC. Yet it's easy to move that scene to another different place or link it to a different NPC, and thus recycle it.<br/>-A wider use of fronts instead of isolated NPCs; say, PCs fight a band of thieves and kill their boss by cleverly bypassing a whole dungeon. It's ok, the whole organization isn't destroyed by that, they just change boss and the new one takes better measures to prevent the use of the same plan. The dungeon can still be recycled and the whole front has become now more interesting since they can be focused on avenging their previous leader.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425752/#Comment_425752" name="Item_220" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-13T07:09:47+00:00" title="December 13, 2013  7:09AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 13, 2013 7:13AM by komradebob.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            WarriorMonk:<br/><br/>I picked up a whole lot of similar concepts along the way as well. I GM much differently today than I used to.<br/><br/>Part of it was just coming to understand a couple of key things, really:<br/><br/>1) As GM, I'm here to have fun too.<br/>Sometimes, that just plain means relaxing and not doing as much prep, and only doing it as needed.<br/>Sometimes it means doing stuff like you suggested and having bits and bobs prepared that I can use or re-use as appropriate.<br/><br/>2) Part of it was also coming to the understanding that occasionally, it was really OK as GM to stop and go: What's the worst that could really happen if [Blank]?<br/><br/>Dirty Hippy games really taught me this one. What is the worst that could happen if the PCs really did convince the King to let them have a small army of his troops? They knock off the dungeon more easily? Ok, so what is the follow on effect of that? Hunh. No kidding, a bunch of interesting stuff opens up for the next session that I hadn't considered!<br/><br/>The CoC investigators take a powder and run away to avoid the mystery? Meh. The session ends early and they later hear something horrible has happened and take even more Sanity loss. Or the world ends. Whatever. I guess the next time they play, the new characters will try a bit harder. Or not.<br/><br/>The Anarchs knock off the Prince and the Primogen and take over the city? Well, there is the example of the Russian Revolution...<br/><br/>3) It's also okay after a certain point to simply stop, drop out of the fiction, and do a real-world discussion rather than try to do a whole lot of in-game subtle techniques to get things back on track.<br/><br/>Are we all here for the same kind of game even? I was expecting Four Color Supers and you guys are killing every master villain straight up? Okay, maybe we are really playing a different sort of supers game than I anticipated. Only one guy is knocking off baddies permanently? Okay, group session: what do we all want to play exactly? Are you ( Odd Man Out) interested in playing the game the rest of us are playing? Can you compromise a bit here?<br/><br/>So there's all of that. It does come at some cost, however, both on the player end and the GM end.<br/><br/>I do think, however, that the widely believed concept that all RPGs are these totally open, sandbox things is an awful pain in the ass that affects understanding of when and how something is a "railroad".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425892/#Comment_425892" name="Item_221" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-17T14:12:16+00:00" title="December 17, 2013  2:12PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're right Bob, I also came to the point of telling myself "As a GM I have the right to have fun too!". And then tumbled on GMing different things with less prep because I wasn't sure where my fun was, though I knew exactly where it wasn't: in doing too much prep, invest too much in it emotionally, stress up about producing it on time and then defending it from the players.<br/><br/>But then after exploring and thinking it a bit more I ended up feeling satisfied with a middle point. Railroading used correctly and in the right measure can be fun for everyone at the table. But then again "the right measure" depends on the GM and the players expectations, so discussing it a bit is always for the best. For me it means to prep interesting scenes that surprise and inspire the players. It also means to let them lead from there (though the temptation of doing further prep assuming this or that reactions from them is really big), because that's where their fun is and the part where you can -as a GM- relax, enjoy and react to the story that is unfolding in front of you.<br/><br/>And you're right, I should ask myself more often that question. I'm not always going for what could go wrong, but for how to make it plausible or how to fit it on whatever I have prepared, or how I can make this fun at it's best.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425908/#Comment_425908" name="Item_222" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-17T22:39:36+00:00" title="December 17, 2013 10:39PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 17, 2013 10:40PM by David_Berg.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            W-Monk, it sounds from your in-between approach to prep that you might like the way <i>Sorcerer</i> does things.  Prep a bit up-front, focus on building NPCs with motives that will engage strongly with the PCs, then bring a list of potential "Bangs" ("Now <i>this</i> happens!  What do you do, players?") to each session.  Beyond that, invest in your NPCs and just play them doing what they'd do.<br/><br/>Personally, I'm rarely motivated to prep, but when I do I focus on ultimate causes.  What's the root of the scenario or location or group or phenomenon?  What's the active ingredient that's influencing this?  <i>A curse?  The presence of something valuable?  A crazy dude with scraps of occult knowledge?  A magical transformation?  A quest for secret power and influence?  A scarcity?  A panic over a missing child?  A war?</i>  Once I have a good answer to that, then I let some immediate encounter stuff drift through my mind, maybe use it, and ad lib the rest.<br/><br/>I'm not claiming your solution needs improving, I'm just comparing notes.  Sounds like we've had similar experiences with over-prep and zero prep.  I dig your cards!  Lot of options on each one -- do you just go with whatever inspires you the most and ignore the rest?  That's kind of what I do for <a href="http://shrikedesign.com/games/delve/cards.html" rel="nofollow">my cards</a>, though pictures get me rolling better than words.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425927/#Comment_425927" name="Item_223" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-18T09:05:54+00:00" title="December 18, 2013  9:05AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 18, 2013 9:21AM by WarriorMonk.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, exactly Dave, I've found out imagination works the best not when constricted to a single choice, but when you give it a limited amount of options as a challenge. For me my deck works by choosing one thing from a single card (whatever I feel may work the best) and putting it together with another two from diferent cards. Works amazing miracles of creativity in less than a minute, and you can consistently keep going on it for the whole session.<br/><br/>However, for coherence there's nothing like preparing fronts, giving them objectives, then create quick NPCs and focuse on making a few really memorable. It's easier if they fit a recognisable <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Characters" rel="nofollow">archetype</a>. So then, if PC doesn't like them and never interact with them, or outright kill them as soon as they show up, etc. you can keep the front going, create a new NPC or reuse one you've already show and presto.<br/><br/>Also, I really like to surprise my players with a good scene from time to time, so I prep that ahead, just by scrpting a bit what they see on the first part of that scene, and then leaving the rest blank for them to fill. Three years ago, when I got burned by overprepping,I was doing this too much and later worn out on the effort to apply illusionism and railroad the players into it/prep for all the different choices the players could take. While it proved to be a complete mistake, It\xb4s doable and fun as a GM, and even for the players if you keep the illusionism/they are at least a bit into participationism. The mistake was that it's a helluva work nobody really appreciates, because players are too busy looking at your illusion and not at your actual effort, and will just keep asking for more instead of actually help you to relax and have fun. So better to take the stress out of it.<br/><br/>Because there's a lot of fun there, in surprising/amazing the players with something out from your mind. And now I believe I can show it to my players without railroad them into it, that I can make their choices matter, that I can consistently improvise creatively the rest along all the sessions, and that the last game I've hacked/developed will actually help me a lot to facilitate all this fun to the players and to me. Best of both railroading and impro worlds. Let's hope it works! <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>EDIT: Just seen your cards and yes, images have more evocative power than words; the only reason I don't use them is that they take too long for me to interpretate at the table. You see, my thinking process goes like this:<br/><br/>draw a card, look at the picture in it &gt; too many concepts on my head &gt; check out the situation at hand, uh, players are staring at me and I'll lose their attention in 5 more seconds &gt; ok, these couple of concepts may work, now I have to interpretate them and add them to the situation &gt; ok, now I've gotta think of the words to describe this to the players&gt; ok, now I've gotta call their attention again and answer a question they made 20 secs ago, how did that go? (because yes, I've got a terrible short term memory)<br/><br/>So yes, doable and fun, but at least for me it takes a bit less than 20 sec to come up with something using cards with tarot-like images, which is too slow (for my group). Rolling on a few random tables has about the same effect and takes a similar amount of time (maybe a bit more if you're not totally familiar with them). So that led me to my current deck design, which reduced the time to about 6 seconds, half of which I'm using to start my description already.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425935">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425935/#Comment_425935" name="Item_224" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-18T10:17:02+00:00" title="December 18, 2013 10:17AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, just some general thinking on this stuff about ways to avoid an urge to railroad at all.<br/><br/>Some of it seems like there's some initial, pre-game start stage that helps with the whole thing starting from buy-in. If it's skipped, there is a greater likelihood of problems.<br/><br/>That buy-in stage needs inherently to cover not just the core concept of the game, but what you'll be doing during the session and how the characters fit into it all of that, as well as how much and what types of leeway players have.<br/><br/>For example, how competitive/challenge based is it? Are characters expected to follow the mission, or do they really have freedom to do anything at all in the setting? Is there some core activity that they need to voluntarily buy into, or a feel to the thing?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19027/hey-contracycle-railroading-illusionism/p4" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19027/hey-contracycle-railroading-illusionism">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19027/hey-contracycle-railroading-illusionism/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19027/hey-contracycle-railroading-illusionism/p3">3</a><a class=" p-4" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19027/hey-contracycle-railroading-illusionism/p4" rel="prev">4</a><a class="Highlight p-5 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19027/hey-contracycle-railroading-illusionism/p5">5</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F19027%2Fx%2Fp5%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F19027%2Fx%2Fp5%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
