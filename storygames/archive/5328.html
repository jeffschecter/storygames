In those cases, go with what's obvious.<br/><br/>The specific details of when and how particular strengths become more significant for whom will affect play, but they won't affect play to its detriment. There's a general rule - "when you come back, you can improve your particular strength, like going from a level 1 exorcist to a level 2 exorcist" - but then whenever an exception to the general rule seems cool and called for, go with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_119853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119853/#Comment_119853" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-16T07:54:22+00:00" title="January 16, 2008  7:54AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So I guess if my character has a PStr of a "the dog-spirit guards my life", and someone else has the same PStr and it's noted as the same dog-spirit, then it should be upgraded for both (the dogspirit leveled), but otherwise no.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119856/#Comment_119856" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-16T08:05:32+00:00" title="January 16, 2008  8:05AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_119857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119857/#Comment_119857" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-16T08:06:41+00:00" title="January 16, 2008  8:06AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 16, 2008 8:08AM by lumpley.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good example.<br/><br/>(Oops.

So, bringing in already-made protags from some other game play might not be a great idea. If you want to mess around in a favorite setting, though, Wicked is a painless and fun option.<br/><br/>We have a long-running pulp sci-fi series (migrated through d20, TSOY, Mu, and SotC) that I'm sure we'll plug in to the Anthology Engine at some point.

First time I've played it since John Harper ran it for us at GenCon.  It was loads of fun: wizards exploded, babies were killed, demons and rune magic were all over the place.  However, there were a few things I noticed which have me a bit worried:<br/><br/>- No one ever chose to roll d4 or d6 forms.  Generally there would be multiple forms that would be applicable to a given situation and people inevitably chose the ones with the best dice.  We rolled d12s, d10s, and d8s all the time, unless folks didn't have those available because of Injury of Exhaustion.<br/><br/>- People rolled the dice for their specials in almost every conflict.  No one ever rolled just two dice, hardly.<br/><br/>- It was hard to find the place in the book where it describes how you compare the size dice you're rolling to see if you get on the We Owe list or not.  It's not part of the We Owe list instructions, but is a kind of throw-away line in the example somewhere.  Also, now that Eric's figured out that he can roll, say, d10 d10 d10 against d12 d6 d4 (where he has a 75% chance of winning) and still get on the We Owe list (Is that right?), I think he's probably going to do that at every chance he gets.<br/><br/>- Bigger dice almost universally won conflicts, because they tend to gain the advantage die in the first round and then just keep rolling through all three rounds.  We only had 1 time in the whole game where the advantage die swapped players once it had been assigned.  That said, being Exhausted or Injured REALLY sucked, because if you went up against someone who hadn't lost a conflict, you were basically toast.  We had one demon character lose two conflicts in a row this way, which meant she was pretty much done after that.<br/><br/>- April mentioned that sometimes you want to roll for a conflict, but you don't want three rounds to work it out and you don't really want to negotiate.  For example, there was one conflict where Eric was trying to throw the baby off a cliff and I was rolling for the baby (who was actually an NPC with the special trait: Destiny), and the conflict ended up stretching to three rounds, so I was forced to invent this magic albatross that was swooping down from the sky to catch the baby and shit.  I mean, it was kinda cool, but we also felt like we should have declared that conflict to be only 1 or 2 rounds long before we started rolling dice.  I suspect, in future games, we may think about altering the number of rounds for certain conflicts, in a sorta TSOY-ish style of having straight rolls and then Bring Down The Pain.<br/><br/>Reading through the alternate rules suggestions at the back of the book, I think those would work really well and may solve some of our problems, especially about always rolling your big dice.

I've often found that with this type of thing I like it best when the players say what they're doing in a general way, then assign dice based on that. Whereas if you go right from "sounds like a conflict" to "which dice" without any "what the dude is actually trying" either before or in the middle then its natural to almost always go only for high dice. (Because at that point you're deciding about dice, not deciding about action, so your action will match your dice, and as you're playing a game going for dice makes sense.) <br/><br/>Which, I know, isn't exactly what it says in the book. Its just a me thing. <br/><br/>I also think that players going for high dice isn't always a bad thing. I mean, hell, Conan usually solves things directly and with violence. And the fact that he does so even in places where it causes him more trouble is what makes him a barbarian.

Glad to know I'm not crazy.  And, Robert, that means that, yes, you can roll big dice and still get on the We Owe list.  So, yeah, funky.<br/><br/>Even if you're counting sides, there still doesn't seem to be any incentive to roll d4s.  You just roll slightly lower dice than your opponent, which can still be fairly big dice.  The only thing I see is that, if people are being Exhausted and Injured all over the place, it may mean that the dice that you can't reduce become more valuable over the course of the game.  So you may have stuck a d6 in one of them that eventually becomes your largest die.  But I'm not sure if the average story will last long enough to see that kind of thing happen.<br/><br/>Brand, I'm not sure how well your suggestion will work for some people.  I mean, sure, it would work for me, but I don't really like thinking strategically about stuff.  For other people... I suspect that they'll always be measuring things in dice. Honestly, this kind of thing is why I sometimes waffle over games that encourage people to think strategically, because sometimes they're only expecting people to be kinda strategic and not actively pursue their goals with all their ability (because this is seen as less cooperative and not as friendly to the other people in the group, which, fair enough, it may be, in some cases).  So, when they do roll really aggressively, things may not work as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120140/#Comment_120140" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-17T09:27:41+00:00" title="January 17, 2008  9:27AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan<br/><br/>For that I think the optional rules could work very well.

"I think this is what you should do because blah blah blah blah" is conversation.  Persuasion and discourse respects the freedom of the participants, and that's not what a system like this is about. If you are still respecting the freedom of the other guy to do what they like, who cares.  If a player decides to use trickery, threats, guilt, whatever to <i>get something</i> from a character, that's action and now we're talking. If it doesn't work, you've lost something - your strategy is exposed, your desire is exposed, your credibility is damaged, and so on.<br/><br/>At least that is my first-pass reading of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120159">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120159/#Comment_120159" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-17T11:55:58+00:00" title="January 17, 2008 11:55AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>Brand, I'm not sure how well your suggestion will work for some people.  I mean, sure, it would work for me, but I don't really like thinking strategically about stuff.  For other people... I suspect that they'll always be measuring things in dice.</blockquote>\nYeah, this is pretty accurate. I was the "Warlord dying of her wounds," and my biggest dice were in For Myself and With Violence. I know perfectly well that I would be rolling my best dice if everything I did was selfish and violent, and so I proceeded to be selfish and violent whenever possible. Talking about what I'm doing and then looking at the dice (and we did this to at least some degree) isn't going to make that character's "With Love" die ever hit the table.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>Vincent, it's possible that was part of the problem. Let me run it again and I'll let you know for sure. I had the sense that players were creeping right up to the conflict and then stopping at the edge of it, as if to say "Do we roll dice now?" I think that may have been largely due to learning a new system and not being sure about procedures and stuff.</blockquote>\nPart of the problem, sure, but not always. There were several times when people did things that other people jumped in to oppose - or, more accurately, did things that they knew that someone else would oppose. And those cases, with concreteness of action, played out the same as everything else - because the demon was always being sneaky and selfish, the warlord was always being violent and selfish, and so on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120160">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120160/#Comment_120160" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-17T12:06:43+00:00" title="January 17, 2008 12:06PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 17, 2008 12:07PM by Eric.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lumpley</cite>Jonathan, yeah.

We had people trying to steal tomes of power, transcend humanity for demonic immortality, and wipe out all sorcery - off the top of my head. Plenty of concreteness to go around in the process - "I pick it up and run off," "I undertake the ritual of transformation," "I slash a page from the spellbook to pervert the spell." Dice conflicts weren't being used for chatting, they were being used to turn babies into magical booby traps and throw them off of towers into the arms of other players. The issue wasn't that conflicts weren't arising from action, but rather that, once the actions were going and we reached for the dice... things... got goofy. Post-game analysis pointed out some possible reasons, but that's when things generally went nutty - not the talking-to-action transition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120162">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120162/#Comment_120162" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-17T12:11:55+00:00" title="January 17, 2008 12:11PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is true, Eric.

Like what does it mean for a Special to target Action or Manuvering or Self-Protection?  In Vincent style, I would expect them to be lists, like: "Is your Special entangling, distracting, encumbering, debilitating, diverting, seducing, persuading, etc?

Like, you could have a young farmboy as a character who has "for myself" d10, "directly" d12, "for others" d8, and "with violence" d4, and he'd be a combat machine because he could just choose the first three to fight with in nearly any situation, and there's really nothing to make him use the "with violence" trait that's supposed to be his weakness. Same thing with your example - you can use "for others" in almost any situation you could use "with love".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120235/#Comment_120235" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-17T18:13:50+00:00" title="January 17, 2008  6:13PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Newquist</cite>Hi Jonathan.

Right, and the demon tries to manipulate them in a sneaky and selfish way and the warlord uses them for her own ends in a violent and selfish way. This actually happened to a limited extent in our game; off the top of my head, Jonathan tried at least once to steer me into a conflict where I would be acting on someone else's behalf (I think), and... I didn't care. I think this happened with every player at some point, and was played out in a similar fashion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120237/#Comment_120237" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-17T18:15:51+00:00" title="January 17, 2008  6:15PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Landon Darkwood</cite>The thing is, it's pretty easy to justify using a stronger trait in most situations.</blockquote>\nRight on the money.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120241/#Comment_120241" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-17T18:19:51+00:00" title="January 17, 2008  6:19PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric</cite><cite>Posted By: Landon Darkwood</cite>The thing is, it's pretty easy to justify using a stronger trait in most situations.</blockquote>\nRight on the money.<br/>True, but that means you're less likely to get on the owe list.<br/><br/>I haven't played enough to see a reason to use d4.

"I say what Mekha does. Since I\u2019ve rolled <b>direct</b> and <b>for myself</b>, it has to be direct and for himself. It can\u2019t be violent, or I\u2019d have rolled <b>with violence</b> instead."<br/><br/>This is kind of an arbitrary statement, however, rather than a rule. The rule is "choose two forms, always two, that match what your character's doing and why". <br/><br/>So it basically has to get "policed" within the group, where if I'm the farmboy with the "with violence" of d4, and I'm all like, "So I hit you on the back of the head with a hoe to try and escape. This is a direct action for myself." then someone else has to go, "Lame, dude. Clearly, that's with violence. You're just trying to get out of rolling that d4.

We have a flood of threads on here making more lists to use to generate story elements, so people are clearly keen on this bit of the game. It was fun and easy, both picking them at random and thinking about how they all fit together. The We Owe list lets you opt out or goof with that process to a certain degree - but I don't want to opt out of it or goof with it, because that was my favorite part. So, honestly, never seeing any of these characters again is something that I'm completely happy with. The game seems set up to encourage that - fast setup, fast character generation, fast setting concepts. And then we play, and a possible reward having my dying warlord suddenly get soft and caring towards puppies is... not getting to do as much fun generation stuff next time we play? Bugger that.<br/><br/>I can keep bringing my dying warlord back forever - it's not even hard, I just set myself up to tank a conflict that I didn't care about to begin with. I just have no idea why I'd want to, based on what I saw of the game. <br/><br/>So, to summarize, here's my take on the game based on our playtest:<br/><br/>1) Good, fast startup based on random story elements.<br/>2) Reasonably fast character generation.<br/>3) Workable but not thrilling conflict resolution, with several janky bits and undefined no-man's-lands.<br/>4) Odd "We Owe" mechanic that seemed somewhat at odds with the part of the game that went over the best.<br/><br/>I think Jonathan and I have communicated some of the salient details of 3) and 4) to a satisfactory extent, so I suppose my purpose of providing feedback is accomplished. We may or may not have played the game "right," but, for my part, I really don't care - I'm just giving my take on how it went down in its debut at SGBoston. If Jonathan runs it again with new insight and wisdom, I'll comment on that experience.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120290/#Comment_120290" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-17T23:36:03+00:00" title="January 17, 2008 11:36PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 17, 2008 11:47PM by Eric.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Last thought: is the We Owe list supposed to be some sort of bribe to deliberately get into conflicts in a way that ensures you'll lose?

It's like a story-game equivalent of min-maxing or having a dump stat.  I think you nailed it with the third paragraph.  "I just have no idea why I'd want to, based on what I saw of the game."<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Owe list is strange in that you need buy in to a specific character.  If you like the fun of pulling characters out of the oracles and see being on the owe list as having to opt out of that fun, then by all means use the owe list entry for an advantage die.  But every now and again there will be a character cool enough that you might want to see again.  The Owe list provides it.  As well, it provides the way characters can reoccur in the genre literature (sword and sorcery pulp fiction).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120300/#Comment_120300" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-18T02:41:16+00:00" title="January 18, 2008  2:41AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The first example in the book mentions something about if you're acting with violence then you need to be acting with violence.

If you're the guy who is sticking to your character's strengths, hitting others where they're weak, generally kicking butt, and not doing much outside your comfort zone... guess what? You're probably an antagonist. Nothing wrong with that. If that's what you're digging, and you want to play a lot of different characters, then you can not worry about the Owe list so much, kick ass, and grab someone new from the oracle in the next chapter.<br><br>It's supposed to work that way. What usually happens is that someone emerges as a key protag, and they get their name on the list a lot. And having your name on the list is the most powerful thing in the game.

When I first saw it I assumed it was because in the type of fiction the game makes the characters that we're going to pay attention to over the long run are those who take on overwhelming odds -- win or lose. We don't care about the guy who always has the advantage, we don't care about the guy who never takes a real chance. We care about the characters who do shit that might bite them, characters who are the underdog at least once in a while, and finding out about how that works out for them in the long run.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120404/#Comment_120404" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-18T11:19:50+00:00" title="January 18, 2008 11:19AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 18, 2008 11:26AM by Valvorik.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Stoughton</cite>The first example in the book mentions something about if you're acting with violence then you need to be acting with violence.

I admit, I would kinda prefer "rules as rules" and "examples as examples", but reading page 21, <br/><br/>Dragon roles high and stands, names 4 to answer (A1 to A4)<br/><br/>A1 picks up and rerolls against Dragon's roll that stands - say A1 loses but not bad enough to be out, Dragon gets advantage die.<br/><br/>- at this point not sure - but I think rather than completing conflict with A1, it now passes to A2<br/><br/>Dragon's roll still stands, A2 picks up and rerolls, Dragon using advantage die.<br/><br/>A2 loses, not bad enough to be out, Dragon keeps advantage die.<br/><br/>etc.<br/><br/>Strategically, the Dragon's downside in affecting multiple targets is that there are that many chances for one of them to double him and knock him out of fight etc., chance of beating all four is not as good as chance of  beating one.  If in the 2nd round Dragon picks up, rolls bad  even with advantage die, and A1 doubles him, Dragon is out.  None of others have to answer again.<br/><br/>You get 2 advantage die by winning one in conflict and buying one with an Owe list cross-off.<br/><br/>There can be more than one person holding an advantage die (say the Dragon lost first round of each of those A1, A2 etc., but not enough to be out - 2nd round starts with each of those A1 to A2 having an advantage die when they roll).<br/><br/>Rob ( there's a question about this on Forge too)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120412/#Comment_120412" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-18T11:45:30+00:00" title="January 18, 2008 11:45AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 18, 2008 11:51AM by lumpley.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Want persnickety 3-dice vs 2-dice rules for who's rolling bigger dice?<br/><br/>If the two dice <i>surround</i> the three dice, the three dice are bigger.

Can I roll d12, d8 for my forms, a d10 for the poison dagger, and another d8 for the uncanny stealth?  Or do I choose one particular strength only?  (Let's say that I'm not worried about the Owe list at this point, I just want your character to be out of the chapter as quickly as possible.)<br/><br/>--<br/>DainXB                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DainXB" title="DainXB"><img alt="DainXB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DainXB">DainXB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120572/#Comment_120572" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-19T06:53:45+00:00" title="January 19, 2008  6:53AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, I have some more questions.  I haven\u2019t got the chance to actually play the game, so all my examples are \u2018virtual play\u2019, but I will try to make them as detailed and plausible as possible.  My questions are in <b>bold</b>, to pick them out of the text of the overly-wordy examples.  Most of the questions concern the nature of NPCs and the nature of \u2018particular strengths\u2019.<br/><br/>We are starting with \u2018God-Kings of War\u2019, one of the Oracle entries is \u2018A cask of honey wine, tribute to a fierce bandit queen\u2019.  We get possible characters;  the bandit queen, any individual bandit, the diplomat presenting the tribute, his military escort, etc.  I pick a character, a soldier in the legion which is accompanying the diplomat.  We decide to use Roman names and a Boudicca\u2019s Revolt motif, so I name him Marius.  <br/><br/>I give Marius the particular strength \u2018Tribune Tullius is my patron\u2019 which gives him a d8 with \u2018for Myself\u2019, and is described as the powerful Tullius being known to take Marius\u2019 side, and publicize his exploits.  It\u2019s not \u2018Unique\u2019, even though Tullius is a specific individual, because he might be a patron to other people as well in just the same way.  It might be \u2018Far-reaching\u2019, since Tullius could act on Marius\u2019 behalf when Marius is not present, allowing me to interact with a conflict within the Imperial Senate, for example.  It might be \u2018Broad\u2019, and useable with \u2018Directly\u2019 as well as \u2018for Myself\u2019.  It might be \u2018Consequential\u2019, affecting a target\u2019s \u2018for Myself\u2019 form, because Tullius can publicly defame someone else just as easily as he can publicly praise Marius.  It might be \u2018Potent\u2019 because of Tullius\u2019 great influence.  It can\u2019t be \u2018Doubly Potent\u2019 because Marius is just starting out.  <br/><br/><b>Am I good so far?</b><br/><br/>I decide on \u2018Broad\u2019, and we go on.  Marius\u2019 interests are to get noticed by the diplomat and promoted to Centurion, and to sleep with the bandit queen.<br/><br/>The chapter plays out, and Marius gets on the top of the Owe list.  The bandit queen is on it as well, further down.  For his appearance in Chapter Two, I decide to add to Marius\u2019 particular strength.  Now \u2018Tribune Tullius is my patron\u2019 is both \u2018Broad\u2019 and \u2018Consequential\u2019, as explained above.  This chapter we are back in the capitol of the empire, doing various things with the new characters from the Oracle.<br/><br/>During play, Tullius get\u2019s mentioned fairly often.  <b>Is it legitimate for the GM to stat Tribune Tullius out as an NPC, and play him in scenes, even though he \u2018exists\u2019 as a particular strength sheet already?</b><br/><br/>Later on in the chapter, I lose a conflict with a rival of Marius\u2019 (an NPC), and we negotiate the loss of \u2018Tribune Tullius is my patron\u2019 as the consequence, rather than exhaustion or injury.  Marius has been pinned with responsibility for some heinous act which Tullius can\u2019t publicly support, so Marius is no longer his prot\xe9g\xe9.  It get\u2019s marked off his sheet.<br/><b><br/>If it wasn\u2019t legitimate for Tullius to be an NPC before, is it legitimate now?</b><br/><br/>In Chapter Three, I mark off Marius\u2019 name on the Owe list in order to bring him in.  Starting with Chapter Three, new characters can begin with particular strengths of significance 2, but returning characters can only add a new particular strength of significance 1, or add 1 to the significance of an exiting particular strength.<br/><br/><b>If I want Marius to be back in Tribune Tullius\u2019 good graces for this chapter, I have to take \u2018Tribune Tullius is my patron\u2019 at significance 1 again, correct?</b> <br/>And if I do, I can write out it\u2019s sheet differently if I want \u2013 making it \u2018Potent\u2019 at significance 1, for example.  <b>Also correct?</b><br/><br/>Several chapters go by.  Marius and the Bandit Queen have both been recurring characters, and are now  written out as follows:<br/><br/>Marius:    Covertly: d8, Directly: d6, for Myself: d10, for Others: d6, with Love: d4, with Violence: d12<br/>                `Tribune Tullius is my patron\u2019 -- 3 -- Potent, Broad, Consequential;  d10 with \u2018for Myself\u2019 and \u2018Directly\u2019 or \u2018Maneuvering\u2019; threatens \u2018for Myself\u2019 or \u2018Action\u2019<br/>                \u2018Centurion, commanding 100 legionnaires\u2019 -- 1 -- Far-Reaching; d8 with \u2018with Violence\u2019<br/><br/>Bandit Queen:        Covertly: d4, Directly: d6, for Myself: d10, for Others: d12, with Love: d6, with Violence: d8<br/>                                `Ancestral Magic Sword, \u2018Grief of Tyrants\u2019\u2019 -- 4 -- Potent, Unique, Consequential, Far-Reaching;  d10 with \u2018with Violence\u2019 or \u2018Action\u2019; <br/><br/>Marius has never managed to sleep with the bandit queen (*sigh*), but she has been a thorn in the Empire\u2019s side for several years.  Now Marius is leading the troops sent to capture the beautiful renegade.  It comes down to a conflict;  Marius acting Directly with Violence, using Tullius\u2019 influence and his own legionnaires, he rolls d12, d10, d8, d6.  The Bandit Queen acting for Others with Violence, and using her magic sword rolls d12, d10, d8.  <b>Correct?</b><br/><br/>After Round One, the Queen goes on the Owe list, for having smaller dice and not getting doubled immediately.  At the end of Round Three, Marius wins, doubling the Queen.  I negotiate consequences with the Queen\u2019s player.  \u201cYou are captured and taken back to the capitol in chains, and I take your magic sword away from you.\u201d  \u201cNo, I\u2019m exhausted or injured.  You pick.\u201d  \u201cHow about you flee into the wilderness, but I take your magic sword back to the capitol with me.\u201d  \u201cOK, I can work with that.\u201d  The sword is marked off the Bandit Queen\u2019s sheet, but I cannot write it on mine.  <b>Correct?</b><br/><br/>On the way back to the Imperial capitol, Marius encounters his old rival (an NPC), and there\u2019s a conflict.  <b>Can I use the sword in conflicts, this chapter, since it\u2019s in my possession, even if it\u2019s not on my sheet?</b> <b>Even if I can\u2019t use it\u2019s die, can I narrate it\u2019s use in the fiction?</b>  For instance, I win the conflict, and the GM agrees to the consequences that Marius kills his rival.  I state that he did it with the magic sword, which leaves obvious arcane evidence so I can pin his murder on the Bandit Queen later\u2026<br/><br/>Actually, this brings up another set of questions:  <b>Can NPCs even come back in later chapters?</b> <b>If so, do they get the same options as other returning characters;  i.e. assign dice anew / add 1 to the significance of a particular strength / add a new particular strength? </b>  If not, no NPC can ever have a particular strength of greater significance than 2.  <b>NPCs created after the start of Chapter Three can begin with a particular strength of significance 2, like PCs can, can't they?</b> <br/><br/>In a later chapter, the Bandit Queen reappears.  One of her interests is recovering her ancestral magic sword.  The sword has been marked off her sheet, but she manages to re-acquire it through play.

(see Rustin's "content" thread query for possible other routes to author NPC's as content).<br/><br/>This leads to possible strategy of \u201ctake out NPCs who are the Particular Strength of a PC to weaken the PC" though such actions will definitely conflict with the PC and Player of the PC will come into that conflict if they choose to and are not \u201cout of the Chapter\u201d.<br/><br/><b>Question:  In a conflict with an NPC who is a PC\u2019s Particular Strength active along with the PC active - is this counted as a multiple conflict with statted NPC and the PC, who does not get to also use the PS die (option A); or a multiple conflict with statted NPC and the PC, who does get to also use the PS die (option <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/>; or a two-way conflict with the PC, who uses their PS die (option C)?  Use of PS die predicated of course of actions narrated that bring it in.</b><br/><br/>Of these, option B seems \u201cbroken\u201d as it gives the Player of the PC with PS(NPC) too much. The other two options seem equally valid and could be chosen between based on what the conflict feels like (if it\u2019s really more about hurting the NPC, affecting them, Option A; if it\u2019s really about hurting the PC, affecting them, Option C).  The added complexity of multiple party conflicts, and a preference for more Player rolling less GM rolling, suggests a bias towards Option C whenever in doubt.<br/><br/>Following up on 9, Returning NPC's do not increase their Particular Strength, new NPC's can have a Particular Strength 2 as of Chapter 3 -&gt; NPC's never get stronger than 2.  This means that as the Chapters go on, the dominant characters are increasingly the PC's, adding to the PC over NPC advantage that NPCs are never getting "owe list-strike advantage dice".  By Chapter 4, a constantly returning PC can have a Particular Strength 4, which is as good as it gets.  Comment, more than question, the GM's characters are not the stars, they stir the pot among PC's.  The GM does not "provide adversity" in this game so much as "provoke adversity".  The GM's dragon NPC is just a way of bringing on conflict among PC's.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120639">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DainXB" title="DainXB"><img alt="DainXB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DainXB">DainXB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120639/#Comment_120639" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-19T17:13:05+00:00" title="January 19, 2008  5:13PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In regard to the strategy of 'take out NPCs who are the particular strengths of PCs' -- I don't think that would necessarily work.  Using the example characters from my post, suppose someone killed Tribune Tullius.  How does that affect Marius?  His particular strength 'Tribune Tullius is my patron' becomes 'Tribune Tullius <i>was</i> my patron';  now it's not about Tullius talking up Marius' accomplishments, pulling strings for him, etc., it's about people reacting to Marius in a positive way because of their respect for his late mentor.  <br/><br/>Ex.:  Marius is trying to influence the Senate into assigning him the mission of capturing the Bandit Queen; a rival is trying to get Marius sent to the Far Northern Frontier Posting Nobody Wants -- Marius speaks to several Senators privately, and he rolls 'Covertly' and 'for Myself' and the die for that particular strength.  If he succeeds, I narrate that wise old Senator Plino, trusting in the judgment of the late and highly regarded Tullius, gives Marius the assignment he wants.  "It's what Tullius would have wanted."  He says.  <br/><br/>Tullius doesn't have to be alive for Marius to trade on his reputation.  Or if Tullius had been in some way publicly disgraced, Marius could still trade on his reputation with people who don't believe Tullius' detractors.  <br/><br/>I do have another question/thought about returning NPCs, though:  I am assuming that 9 above, "if the Oracle spits them up for you" can be interpreted as broadly for the GM as for the players.  In the rules, "The unwitting husband of a serpent-demoness" comes up and is grabbed by Mekha's player as describing Mekha in that chapter.  I assume that the GM could do the same thing in order to bring back an NPC.  "Unwitting husband of a serpent-demoness?  That's got to be Tribune Tullius!"  Pity poor <i>Marius</i> when he figures this out, and figures out what he must do... <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/><br/>The next part of 9, the "no (and, correct)" part, implies that doing something like this is the <i>only</i> way NPCs ever get to 'heal' their step-losses, since they can't assign dice anew.  <br/><br/>-- <br/>DainXB                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120648/#Comment_120648" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-19T18:22:21+00:00" title="January 19, 2008  6:22PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rob: option B might be just what's called for, too.<br/><br/>With all these kinds of questions, the best thing to do is to have in mind that there are a variety of ways to handle it, and choose case-by-case which you'll use. Have a little conversation at the table whenever it comes up.<br/><br/>Do remember though that negotiation can never go like this: "I doubled you! How about we erase the particular strength from Mitch's character sheet?" "Okay!" Whatever happens to Tribune Tullius, his patronage remains a particular strength of Marius, until somebody negotiates otherwise with Marius' player. <br/><br/>WRT "are NPCs adversity?" The answer is, of course they are. Remember that the players want their characters to go onto the owe list; that means rolling smaller dice than your opponent.<br/><br/>Dain: at the beginning of the chapter, assign all NPCs their dice.

Death of the NPC patron is just a provocation of more creativity and nifty content explaining how they continue to provide the benefit.  It may be a very logical goal for some characters to pursue but doesn't necessarily change a PC's "dice".<br/><br/>Vincent, thanks for continuing the high rate of response to questions.  Sorry if I seemed to be suggesting NPC's aren't adversaries.  I meant that "in the end" the story is more about how PC's deal with the adversity among themselves than with NPC's (e.g., I suspect that hitting PC's with NPC conflicts early on is important way of defining PC interests and conflicts in such in the 'circling' approach described in text).  <br/><br/>A big part of what strikes me about IAWA and some of Vincnet's other work is that GM's characters are not "equal" to PCs nor intended to be developed in the system system detail because they aren't the stars, the GM is not "living through them" in the way Players do through PCs.  That's a trend I see in a number of games that I applaud both in terms of "how a GM should approach NPCs" and also as a GM workload issue.  PCs need enough fiddly bits to satisfy Player design hunger and can have more because each has a specialized caretaker Player, NPCs only need enough fiddly bits to fill their role on stage and should have fewer recognizing they have a generalist GM caretaker.  The way IAWA collapses NPC stats to still give them 2 dice but not worry as much about the distribution among styles/objectives is a great example of that.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120662/#Comment_120662" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-19T20:04:45+00:00" title="January 19, 2008  8:04PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>Hey Vincent, how about if, the next time we play, our crew goes by the spirit of Owe List rules instead of the letter?

That feels better to me than counting die sides or just looking at the highest die, which may not tell the whole story.</blockquote>\nI love it, personally. Given our math-and-sciences-heavy player base, it works particularly well. Between the following 2 options:<br/><br/>1) Figure out who has the mathematical disadvantage, discounting the advantage die, and put them on the We Owe list.<br/><br/>2) Look up a special rule in the book every time things seem unclear.<br/><br/>...I'm going with 1) every time. Most of the time it's obvious (d12 d10 d8 vs. d12 d8 d6, etc...), and we can grind out the edge cases by hand in less time than it would take to dig out the book and find the reference.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120786/#Comment_120786" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-20T15:32:42+00:00" title="January 20, 2008  3:32PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The principle as I understand it is: starting a conflict when the odds are against you should get you on the owe list.  You come back, gain advantage by being underdog and perhaps losing.  This creates an incentive to not "play to your strength" and goes back to the 2006 blog entry by Vincent that underlies IAWA (see forge thread for link etc.).<br/><br/>Other than sorting out if the printed rule or the "persnickety variant" Vincent has offered, or something else best reflects that underlying intent in the design, I think varying it otherwise "moves off the intent" of the game's design.  You motivate people by feeding back to what they choose to do, not by what the dice create.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120791">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120791/#Comment_120791" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-20T15:47:16+00:00" title="January 20, 2008  3:47PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And I don't even have feelings! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I think the rule as written is plenty clear.
