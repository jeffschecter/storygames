Self-explanatory; you play a cell of Sleepers keeping stupid dukes from waking the tiger.<br/><br/>2) My Life with Abel: you play Alex Abel's closest assistants, confidants and advisers. Try to keep the man happy and wonder if your cushy goodies are worth what he's doing.<br/><br/>3) Team Secret Sauce (Primetime Adventures): play out the wild antics, social drama, escalating dilemmas and lofty ideals of a group of Mak Attaxers.<br/><br/>4) Five Dukes (The Mountain Witch): there's a rivalry in this city as old as anyone, and one side has hired you to end it. You've never met these guys, and you hope you never do again, but the money's good, and so is whatever else you're in this for. Let's just hope you can hold these crazy fuckers together long enough to get out of this alive.<br/><br/>5) Rescue 333 (InSpectres): when you and your friends put an ad for an "occult detective agency" in the newspaper, you thought you were joking. Now you know better.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
