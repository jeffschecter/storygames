It's on June 21st (and 22nd!).  We'd love to see you there. It is also, apparently, <a href="http://www.freerpgday.com/" rel="nofollow">Free RPG Day</a>.  I wasn't familiar with Free RPG Day, but I hear it is a growing  annual event. How do other FLGSs celebrate it?<br/><br/>One of our local gaming stores was disappointed that we'd scheduled it that day--they wanted to invite us in to do stuff for the big day. In lieu of this, we're going to take part at Jiffy &amp; in cross-pollinating ways with the local stores. I invite everyone to bring any free games they have to Jiffy--got a playtest version you'd like to circulate? Or a mini-game or adventure? We can put them out for give aways at the con, and also bring them to the stores. They are hungry for new stuff. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/><br/>In general, this seems like a great way to bring indie stuff into new hands. <br/><br/>best,<br/>Emily                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
