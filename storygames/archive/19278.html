He is on a journey through time, seeking out those he judges worthless and erasing them from existence, allowing a different person to exist in their place\u2014one of the many that could have been conceived had they not been.<br/><br/>Each crew member comes up for judgment, with the Inquisitor morphing into each crewmember during their respective trial, meaning that they are actually being judged by themselves (which the Inquisitor claims is "the only fair way" in spite of the metaphysical implications).</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429444">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429444/#Comment_429444" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-13T12:25:54+00:00" title="March 13, 2014 12:25PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 13, 2014 12:27PM by catty_big.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't recall that ep, but it does sound like Red Dwarf.

The original point was to ensure you had a good hand of cards to ensure a good outcome should you be the accused in the final judgement scene. With that gone there was no reason to keep the randomness. It was a balance thing: better to have simplicity and give everyone a chance to play every character versus mechanics for mechanics' sake.<br/><br/>Also, in the playtest, Fabio drew being the judge three times in a row!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
