So, rather than bog down play at the table exploring this guy's history, I suggested doing a bit of play-by-email between sessions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not interested in using the 4e rules for pbem. (4e is for table top mini-combat, and for this it works great.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a decent kicker from him, which I've gone ahead and build up quite a bit of backstory.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what system would you recommend for this pbem?<br/>\n<br/>\nI started with the IAWA mechanic-- and rather than explain the rules, I just sort of go to the dice when I think there is conflict.  He picked up on the nature of negotiations quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's the issue, IAWA kind of stalls out when there is no urge to get on the Owe list, and much of the back story is already filled out by me, so that is a bit of a constraint.  Plus, I have some implied Best Interests, from him, given his kicker, but nothing is super clear. (His kicker is mostly a mystery--his guy has missing memories and such).<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd like to try Sorcerer, but that would require defining humanity and demons-- which is more than I think he's ready to deal with.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuggestions?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166668">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166668/#Comment_166668" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-02T14:17:03+00:00" title="September  2, 2008  2:17PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd avoid combats entirely, and try to just talk out history without any "play."
