Guess they're looking forward to releasing expansion packs, and at least the necessary statistics are in there. Also... well... so many of the traits are immensely lacklustre, only doing stuff like granting a +2 bonus to certain skill attempts. There're a few more interesting examples, psychic abilities, alien abilities and stuff like that, but ordinary people aren't very well catered for. At least the system itself appears to stand up reasonably well and promotes the kind of activities seen in the TV show - i.e. talking your way out because one shot from a Dalek blaster is 100% lethal, and even bare fists can take down most ordinary people in two or three punches - but I did find myself wishing there was a little bit more to the game.<br/><br/>Still, it's a darn sight more interesting than the stuff Margaret Weiss has been throwing out with careless abandon, and the extra bits and bobs (cardboard Story Point chips, pretty clear plastic dice, separate NPC character sheets) are a welcome addition. Box sets just feel so... retrograde though, and the cost is somewhat expensive for all the flash and razamataz that's been lavished on presentation.<br/><br/>Nevertheless I think that with a solid line of support behind it, Doctor Who could grow to be a pretty respectable game.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246588/#Comment_246588" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-14T10:58:04+00:00" title="December 14, 2009 10:58AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 14, 2009 10:58AM by Bret_Gillan.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Any opinions on this yet?

Thankfully it doesn't suffer from the rules bloat which Cubicle-7 demonstrated with Starblazer Adventures. <br/><br/>Personally I like this game a lot, and have it lined up to play after we finish Diaspora. Its pretty, its easy to explain and its fairly rules light. Its also very much written to meet the expectations of the literature. There are some things I could have questioned, the dice mechanic is particularly poor (or maybe its because my brain was addled with alcohol when I played) requiring too much metal arithmetic and the game isn't nearly as revolutionary as some at Cubicle-7 seem to think but its a definite 'thumbs up'.<br/><br/>This quarter seems to be the quarter for big licences and high production values, with WFRP3, Dragon Age and Doctor Who. So far I'm giving Dragon Age a thumbs down, Doctor Who a thumbs up and I'll see what I think of WHRP3 on Christmas day.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247097/#Comment_247097" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-16T10:49:47+00:00" title="December 16, 2009 10:49AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 16, 2009 10:51AM by JuddG.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My mini review (after waiting until midnight opening day to snag it - feeling like those people that stand in lines for X-Box games, God Love Them):<br/><br/>Look - 5/5 Very well crafted look, nice use of photo elements and test is clear and helpfully arranged.  I really like the use of the psychic paper picture as the sidebar element for quick tips.<br/><br/>Rules - 4/5  Simple and clear rules, with lots of support for story gaming concepts.  Very quick task resolution with traits that are extremely expandable by playgroups.  Alot of common sense is used in when a trait is usefuland when it isn't.  The task resolution has the "Yes, and..." and "No, but.." improv concepts built into it.<br/><br/>Pros:  Support for non-Doctor Time Lords or non-Time Lord based games, clear examples, concise rules, open-ended setting creation is easy and common sense<br/>Cons: Some repetition of concepts (to ram ideas home), Focus on current Doctor Adventures in materials, old-school GM control advice in GM guide<br/><br/>This is based on my first run-through of the game texts, but I am very impressed with it.  I also second the idea that a Firefly game using this same system and design ethos would have been most welcome.  In fact, I may run a one-off of a Serenity-like crew who have access to a Vortex Drive of some sort ("You can't take Time from me!")                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247258">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/R00kie" title="R00kie"><img alt="R00kie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/R00kie">R00kie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247258/#Comment_247258" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-17T04:24:54+00:00" title="December 17, 2009  4:24AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of the best ideas in Doctor who is the initiative order. By allowing actions to interrupt each other and placing speech, before running, before non-violent action, before shooting they have very effectively made talking your way out of things the most effective way to survive a gun fight. Want to survive an encounter with a dalek - just make sure the first thing you say is reason enough for it not to shoot you. You will always manage to get that phrase off before it shoots and since it will always defend even if it chooses to shoot you phrase will actually distract its aim. If you cant think of anything to say, then run or do something non-violent (like hitting a door panel to shut a door).<br/><br/>Violence in Doctor Who is brutal, usually fatal and very short. PCs generally don't stand much chance in a gun fight with most of the enemies, but it doesn't matter because choosing to get involved in a gun fight really is a choice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247260">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247260/#Comment_247260" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-17T04:44:07+00:00" title="December 17, 2009  4:44AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Holee Cow, that Initiative mechanic is hot!

I totally agree with Rookie on the point of allowing persuasion to always precede fighting during combat scenes, since this is invariably what happens in the show. Someone looks like having a barny, and the Doctor immediately jumps in with placatary self-effacement or disarming wit before matters can escalate further. I am not so certain about interrupting actions - there's the potential for them to possibly subvert the whole point of initiative - but I'm willing to keep an open mind about them until I have a chance to actually play the game.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247279/#Comment_247279" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-17T07:45:42+00:00" title="December 17, 2009  7:45AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I might be wrong but based on what I've seen simple tests basically test for intent, just like BW.<br/>Also, the success ladder is: No, and; No; No, but, Yes, but; Yes, Yes, and.<br/><br/>I appears that there is a lot of contemporary and clever design in there, it's just that the core dice mechanic (2d6 + attribute + skill + trait) looks quite boring, old and potentially needlessly complicated.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247459/#Comment_247459" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-18T06:48:20+00:00" title="December 18, 2009  6:48AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah someone should steal that initiative mechanic and bolt it on to a western game about religious gunslingers.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247592/#Comment_247592" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-19T08:53:26+00:00" title="December 19, 2009  8:53AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Vernon R</cite>Yeah someone should steal that initiative mechanic and bolt it on to a western game about religious gunslingers.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></blockquote>\nActually, it works in reverse.

Having done that we discover that most humans have the same value for most of the their abilities. Rather than having humans with 1 in everything lets redefine this baseline as zero, making -1 (below average), and +1 (above average) the exceptions. These would be the extremes for humans having divided everything by three. Having done this the maths should much easier easy. Of course instead of adding 2d6 (a bell curve with a range of 11) we need a much smaller bell curve. Using a couple of Fudge dice will give a small bell curve and simplify the maths even further. All the traits which used to add +2 now just add +1 (which actually makes the traits more powerful).<br/><br/>The end result is that the typical roll for an unskilled human is now 0 instead of 10, and the target difficulty for an easy task should be 0 instead of 9. Difficulties will go up in 1s instead of 3s. Normal Difficult is now 1, Tricky is now 2, etc through to Nearly Impossible! at 8.<br/><br/>A standard success is now succeeding by 0, a good success is now succeeding by 1, and a fantastic succeeding by 2 or more.<br/><br/>Would this work? I have no idea - it would need to be play tested. For all I know these tweaks might completely ruin the game.<br/><br/>In addition you would need to work out the impact of story points. Converting the effect you probably add 2+2dF, but this is actually more complicated than the original effect of adding 2d6.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247759">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/R00kie" title="R00kie"><img alt="R00kie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/R00kie">R00kie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247759/#Comment_247759" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T07:36:22+00:00" title="December 21, 2009  7:36AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: R00kie:<br/>In addition you would need to work out the impact of story points.
