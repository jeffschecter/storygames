("Involve the players whenever possible", "Avoid stereotypes", "Description, dialogue, and action")<br/>Something kind of like small-scale Principles; not quite Moves, but close. ("Make each scene vivid with detail", "Make your ST characters individuals", "Act out the conversation")<br/><br/>I took another look at the section on creating stories, and honestly the format can be read as "Pick a content-theme, like personal revenge, millenialism, or factional struggle. Now, think of a kicker that engages this theme AND the players' characters." <i>[2 of the 3 examples given are actually really solid; only one of them is a classic "hook" in that the onus is on the players to take an offer, as opposed to their unlives being threatened and they must respond]</i><br/>Advice on creating cool NPCs follows. <br/><br/>So basically, even though there are elements of the game and the game-advice I don't care for (I'm working on a hack for Humanity, and the text does strongly suggest that the game should be about the story the ST wants to tell - - see p257 "Written In Blood"), this is a pretty comprehensive, detailed how-to on running the game. <br/><br/>Of course, when I encountered the game in high school, I mainly got my play advice from InQuest magazine.<br/>"Yes, of course, the vozhd in the warehouse was just a dream sequence!" Seriously though, vozhds are the creepiest, awesomest thing ever.<br/>or<br/>"Yes, of course, casting the darkness ritual in daytime teleports you to the world of Mad Max!" Because seriously, Mad Max is one of the awesomest things ever. There was a high laser-sharking quotient when I was in high school. <br/><br/>So the advice may have just gone over my head at the time. ^__^<br/><br/>Consider this a companion thread to the 3e DMG discussion.<br/><br/>Love and kisses,<br/>your MC, Z in VA                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368104/#Comment_368104" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-16T09:07:04+00:00" title="March 16, 2012  9:07AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Vampire is a pretty great game.

Bangs are the things that GMs write to challenge PCs. But maybe Storyteller does mean for the GM to write that Kicker for the PC, which is an interesting difference between those games and Sorcerer--consistent with "the text does strongly suggest that the game should be about the story the ST wants to tell."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368175/#Comment_368175" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-16T16:44:04+00:00" title="March 16, 2012  4:44PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Definitely.
