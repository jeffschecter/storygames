Usually I email random people from my 100+ person gaming email list... who wants to game? And then we go! And it's usually more specific... who wants to play... Polaris... bam! So people who have no interest in Polaris don't play. And those who do... light a candle! <br/><br/><b>But you said you have a Wednesday group? </b><br/><br/>Yes! <br/><br/>My friend just had a kid and Wednesday free away from family. She told me she was sad she wasn't gaming so BAM... Wednesday group was born to run a short campaign. We played 10 sessions of Mouse Guard and it was ridiculously epic. You can <a href="http://www.burningwheel.org/forum/showthread.php?10079-Sprucetuck-the-new-Barkstone-Science-gone-wrong!" rel="nofollow">read about it here</a>.<br/><br/><b>So what's the problem? </b><br/><br/>The group was composed of good friends who live in the neighborhood or relatively close by. So instead of saying... Polaris... and Polaris lovers came over... it's more find the right game to fit the interests of 5 different people (which given my usual lack of a weekly gaming group, I'm not used to it). I've found Mouse Guard is a super safe and convenient game for groups of different interests. But now what?<br/><br/><b>What different interests?</b><br/><br/>Lots! <br/><br/>But a game that has the following works...<br/><br/>- fast paced<br/>- you don't spend 30 minutes talking and never roll anything <br/>- but the game isn't combat, combat, combat<br/>- character focused / character driven<br/>- characters grow / change<br/>- no emo (I'm so sad, I will now cry or become a furry)<br/>- no player vs player<br/>- high drama / heroics<br/>- the game isn't "whiffy" (I failed every roll for the last 3 hours and nothing moved forward)<br/>- it's not a 1 shot, we can play 3-6+ sessions<br/>- strong GM role, players do not have GM powers<br/>- realism and historical accuracy doesn't matter<br/>- less prep for the GM the better<br/><br/>I actually like a lot of the above, for example I enjoy PvP, but this is the middle ground.<br/><br/><b>What should we play tomorrow?</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310414/#Comment_310414" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-01T12:01:08+00:00" title="February  1, 2011 12:01PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 1, 2011 12:07PM by Daniel H..">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Complete Psionics Handbook Hack.<br/><br/>(EDIT: Real answer is three or more sessions of Lady Blackbird.

I ran it for my regular group last night for the first time and it was practically effortless. Moreover, it encompassed pretty much every point on your list:<br/><br/>- fast paced (Check.)<br/>- you don't spend 30 minutes talking and never roll anything (You roll all the time, but it's not involved or laborious.)<br/>- but the game isn't combat, combat, combat (Nope, the characters are constantly rolling trying to do clever things.)<br/>- character focused / character driven (Yep. There's 5 pre-gen characters who all have personal allegiances and goals. What's more, you refresh your character's die pool by having heart-to-heart conversations that flesh out the story.)<br/>- characters grow / change (Each character has goals (or Keys, as the case may be) and works toward fulfilling them.)<br/>- no emo (I'm so sad, I will now cry or become a furry) (It's a pretty funny, swashbuckling game.)<br/>- no player vs player (PvP in the context of Luke bickering with Han, but not in terms of out-and-out combat.)<br/>- high drama / heroics (Lemme just say this again; 'swashbuckling'.)<br/>- the game isn't "whiffy" (I failed every roll for the last 3 hours and nothing moved forward) (Oh things move forward even when you screw up... just maybe not in the direction the players want.)<br/>- it's not a 1 shot, we can play 3-6+ sessions (I'd say 3 would probably be likely, but it can last as long as the players keep the story rolling.)<br/>- strong GM role, players do not have GM powers (It's not a GM-less system. The GM is definitely the orchestrator, but I think there's more latitude to allow the characters the freedom to try crazy stuff that <i>just might work</i>.)<br/>- realism and historical accuracy doesn't matter (It's a magical steampunk spaceship story with aerial combat and SKY SQUIDS! 'Nuff said.)<br/>- less prep for the GM the better (You could probably run the game from scratch with 15 minutes notice.)<br/><br/>So, yeah. That would be my vote.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310417/#Comment_310417" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-01T12:15:16+00:00" title="February  1, 2011 12:15PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I third the motion for Lady Blackbird.

There are at least 2 suggestion I had not considered that I will now propose to the group.<br/><br/>I know nothing of <b>Dungeon World</b> but it sounds exciting. I think the group would play D&amp;D 4E if they weren't 1. burnt out on playing lots of D&amp;D 4E, 2. if skill challenges worked so we could have mechanically supported non-combat scenes, 3. combat didn\u2019t take forever (although Essentials helps fix this) and 4. actually there is no four! <b>Has anyone played Dungeon World?</b> It looks cute. <br/><br/><b>The Shadow of Yesterday</b> could work (I've played in 2 campaigns of it). I know a few of the players are minorly Fudge dice adverse but it could be their allergy was just an odd case of indigestion<br/><br/>One of the players disliked <b>Lady Blackbird</b> when they played it. I don't remember why but it was at a con so I don't know how representative it was. It may have had to do with feeling there weren't mechanical choices they found personally interesting. But I will ask. That said, I've heard good things and it definitely looks like it fits all the parameters. And another players is the president of the John Harper fan club.<br/><br/><b>Hero's Banner</b> and <b>In a Wicked Age</b> wouldn\u2019t work. PvP is likely non-negotiable. And I love PvP! <br/><br/>I\u2019ve heard great things about <b>Trollbabe</b> and 1 of my friends did illustrations for it but none of us own it and I don\u2019t actually know anything about it other than people saying \u201cit rocks.\u201d<br/><br/>I suspect we will return to <b>Mouse Guard</b> at some point. I don't think Mouse Guard is perfect but damn, it makes so many things so easy. <br/><br/>I'm down for <b>Free Market</b>. It would work with the group's preferences. One of the players has played Free Market like crazy and I'm not sure if they are burned out on it but I will ask. But (and this is meant purely as humor) I know a few people who might get angry at us out of jealousy. It's weird, I know of a bunch of people in NYC who want to play Free Market and keep thinking about it but haven't made the leap. <br/><br/><b>Apocalypse World</b> works although 4 out of the 5 players have played it a bunch in different groups very recently. My only concern is PvP. I don't think AW has to do PvP. Maybe if we just discussed that before hand and made sure to metagame PvP possible situations out of the game, even when they make sense fiction wise.<br/> <br/>2 of the players have read but not played <b>DREAD the First Book of Pandemonium</b>, and really didn't like it. I'm not sure why. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Daniel H.</cite>Complete Psionics Handbook Hack.</blockquote>\nYou, James, Terry and I have to play this!

General play alternates between a STORY phase and a CHALLENGE phase.  For reduced setup time, it is recommended (as a starting point at least) to take the setting from a fictional source that all the players are familiar with.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game concentrates on:<br/>\n\u2022\tDetailed characterization<br/>\n\u2022\tCollaborative narration during Story phase<br/>\n\u2022\tCharacter goal setting deriving from characterization and situation.<br/>\n\u2022\t100% Character-POV play during Challenge phase<br/>\n\u2022\tDramatic/cinematic resolution style during Challenge phase<br/>\n<br/>\nAs such it would be best suited to action-oriented games with a dramatic/cinematic resolution style, and best suit players who like to contribute to the narration (either a little or lot) and like their characterization to play a meaningful part in the story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310457/#Comment_310457" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-01T14:58:39+00:00" title="February  1, 2011  2:58PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 1, 2011 2:59PM by jenskot.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            stefoid, wouldn't that work against the groups preference for "players do not have GM powers"? <br/><br/>Unless I'm misunderstanding "Collaborative narration during Story phase".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310459/#Comment_310459" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-01T15:12:28+00:00" title="February  1, 2011  3:12PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi.  yes, but one of my design goals was to make the story phase semi-optional.

Did characters never butt heads in the Mouse Guard game?<br/>Not everyone in the groups is averse to PvP. But some are so we try to work within their comfort zone. I think out of 10 full sessions we had only 1 minor vs. roll between players.

I really haven't decided how story phase should happen with respect to : what point of view do players have when in story mode?  I mean,  optionally contributing suggestions about what happens is one thing  -- "wouldnt it be cool if..."  is just chipping in with an idea.  As you say, describing actions of NPCs is another thing -- thats narrative authority -- players saying 'this actualyl does happen'.  I havent described any advice or structure for that because I dont know much about it in practice.<br/><br/>I would like this game to be on the immersive end of the scale rather than story boarding exercise end, so I am leaning towards players being able to play their characters during story phase, but give them a little more freedom to assert situations and interactions that involve their character.  Obviously they can suggest things that might occur with other PCs, but not assert.  but when it involves their own character, I would like the player to be able to assert stuff in story phase like "An old girlfriend rings up and seems really upset, and demands that I meet her straight away but she wont tell me why."  I can see how that would be outside of some groups comfort zones, even as it is optional.  Of course a certain group could play without that kind of story phase contribution, and just stick 100% to 'this is what my character is doing now.. what happens?' and 'these are my characters goals for the next challenge phase'.  I would be interested to see how a playtest in that comes out in that mode of play...<br/><br/>Anyway , enough hijacking your thread.  good luck!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310486">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310486/#Comment_310486" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-01T16:59:46+00:00" title="February  1, 2011  4:59PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played Dungeon World, of course.

But mostly PvP was my concern and the slight chance of emo leaking in (I like PvP and emo but the group as a whole doesn't).<br/><br/>That all said... we went with Smallville for tonight's session.<br/><br/>It was a bumpy ride, with many enjoyable moments. The game has a lot of brilliance in it. I found many aspects of the game more "cutting edge" than Apocalypse World which I love and also think is brilliant. But much of the brilliance is trapped in a very hard to use form. I read through the book before the session and although I was worried by the organization and editing, it ended up being more of a problem than I expected.
