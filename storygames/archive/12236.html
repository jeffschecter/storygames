Rather, if you already know that the event "we're playing Donjon" has already happened, then it seems to me that the probability of somebody rolling multiple d20s in the near future is pretty damn high.

There are a couple ways to do this. In order to make this example work, I'm using a fictional d5 in some places:<br/><br/><b>d100</b>: A typical percentage roll. Min is 1, max is 100, average is 50.5.<br/><br/><b>3d30+4d4-6</b>: Weird, but has the same range and average. Roll all 1's, you get (7-6=1). Roll max values you get (90+16-6=100). Min is 1, max is 100, average is 50.5.<br/><br/><b>5d20+d5-5</b>: Another funky formula, but examine it. If all dice roll 1's, you get (6-5=1). If all dice roll maximum, you get (105-5=100). So same range. Also has the same average: min is 1, max is 100, average is 50.5.<br/><br/><b>11d10-10</b>: Also strange, but does have the same range (and, as an added bonus, the dice actually exist). Roll all 1's and you get (11-10=1). Roll all 10's and you get (110-10=100). So, min is 1, max is 100, average is 50.5.<br/><br/><b>20d5+d20-20</b>: More fictional d5's at work, but the same characteristics... min is 1, max is 100, average is 50.5.<br/><br/>So, if they have the same minimum, same maximum and the same average, why choose one over the other? <br/><br/>As you can see from the <a href="http://anydice.com/program/76" rel="nofollow">graph</a>, the only question that matters in this particular case is "how common do you want the average roll to be"? In the d100 case, all results are equally likely. As the number of dice you roll increases, odds of rolling near the average increase.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274469/#Comment_274469" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-04T08:13:57+00:00" title="June  4, 2010  8:13AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>It's pretty unlikely that anyone would roll multiple d20s.</blockquote>\nI'm running a roll-under-your-stat dice pool game right now that uses multiple d20s (usually 2-4).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_274474">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

As you can see, the range and median naturally change, which makes it a bit hard to compare the graphs. In a typical case of trying to decide if a mechanic should use, say 3d20 or 6d20, once you made that choice, you would scale the other numbers in the game. That is since the maximum result of 3d20 is 60, but the max of the 6d20 is 120, you would double the other numbers in the game. For example if this game used some sort of target number concept, maybe a "really difficult" target in the 3d20 system would be 50. If you switched to 6d20, the "really difficult" target would be 100, if you wanted to keep the same kind of effect. Does such scaling really make any difference<br/><br/>Does such scaling really make any difference? It's hard to tell from that graph. What happens, though, if you stretch the curves in this graph so that they have the same start and endpoints? If you did this, the actual numbers at the bottom of the graph would be sort of meaningless, but you could at least compare the curves visually a bit better. After fighting with the AnyDice tool a bit (it rounds everything to integers), I added some scaling to get <a href="http://anydice.com/program/78" rel="nofollow">this</a>. The plot is a bit wonky (exposed either a bug or a feature in AnyDice, I think), but you get the basic idea. The basic notion of the curve basically the same for all but the linear d20. The numbers on the x-axis are useless, but note how between two numbers (e.g. 240 and 335) there are different numbers of "dots" on each curve. The black d20, for example, has only two results in that range. The 2d20 has twice that many. The 4d20 has four times that many. That is, the "distance" between results sort of shrinks as the number of dice go. (This is what I meant by "resolution" or "granularity" above.)<br/><br/>Why would this matter? I can only think of the following reasons:<br/><br/>1) Consider a +1 bonus in the game. In a d20 system, +1 means adding 5%. In a 6d20 game, adding +1 means much, much less. A 6d20 would need to add +6 to get roughly the same impact that +1 gives to a d20 system. So, if you want to "fine tune" bonuses, the more dice you add the more granularity you have.<br/><br/>2) Again, the distribution is different. As the number of dice go up, more likely an average result occurs. Or, looking at it another way, the less likely an extreme result occurs. Suppose in your 3d20 game, a result of 59-60 means "critical hit" or something similar. If you change to 6d20, even if you double the range of this "critical" to be 117-120, it is still much less likely to hit in the the 6d20 game, because the probability doesn't scale linearly. (Chance in the 3d20 game is around 0.05%, while it approaches zero in the 6d20 game.)<br/><br/>3) Combine these two and you get something else: the benefit of that +1 bonus actually changes depending on where in the curve it applies. If you are trying to hit some target around the median, it doesn't matter that much because you are likely to roll around there anyway. If you are trying to hit a number in the extreme ranges, it could matter a lot. Or, the reverse could be true. It depends how the system works. Point is, once you start using multiple dice, linear bonuses get a bit wacky.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_274558">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274558/#Comment_274558" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-04T12:49:53+00:00" title="June  4, 2010 12:49PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 4, 2010 12:50PM by Guy Srinivasan.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Procedure for translating your ranges, bonuses, etc. from what was previously 3d20 to your new proposed 6d20:<br/>1) Find the ratio of the averages. 6d20 has 2x the average of 3d20. This is your baseline scale factor.<br/>2) Find the ratio of the variances. 6d20 has 2x the variance of 3d20.<br/>3) Take the square root of the variance ratio to find your distance-from-average scale factor. sqrt(2) = 1.414.<br/><br/>Now you have two numbers: 2 and 1.414.

There are two important pieces - first the average, then the distance from the average. To translate to your new shiny 6d20 system without changing the odds much? Multiply your average by the baseline scale factor: 31.5*2 = 63. Multiply your distance-from-average by the distance-from-average scale factor: 18.5*1.414 = 26. Your new "Really Difficult" target number is 63+26=89. Compare with AnyDice to verify: <a href="http://anydice.com/program/79" rel="nofollow">Really Difficult</a><br/><br/>b) Linear bonuses. Consider a +3 bonus in the 3d20 game. Should it be a +6 bonus in the 6d20 system? No, because the +3 is sliding the target to be some new distance-from-average. Instead it should become a +3*1.414 ~= +4 bonus. Notice you won't be able to translate perfectly... does a +1 bonus in 3d20 translate to a +1 or a +2? Neither will be spot-on, since it "should" be a +1.4. AnyDice to verify: <a href="http://anydice.com/program/7a" rel="nofollow">Linear Bonus</a><br/><br/>c) Critical hits. If 59-60 used to be a crit, what should a crit be in the 6d20 game? Well, 59 is 31.5 plus 27.5, so that translates to 31.5*2 + 27.5*1.414 = 102. Your new range should be 102-120. AnyDice: <a href="http://anydice.com/program/7b" rel="nofollow">Critical Hits</a> But that's 4x as probable! Still wildly improbably, sure, but now it's 1/500 instead of 1/2000. What went wrong? Near the ends of the distribution, approximations that are off by a little in absolute terms may be off by a large factor in relative terms. Lesson: Follow the procedure for anything that's kind of common to roll, and rework anything that's explicitly meant to be a very extreme example.<br/><br/>*I glossed over the fact that a target of "at least 50" is better viewed as a target of "higher than 45.5".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274936/#Comment_274936" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-07T23:27:16+00:00" title="June  7, 2010 11:27PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for all of the responses!
