They took PTA, Dogs in the Vineyard, Mouse Guard, In A Wicked Age, FATE and relationship maps from Sorcerer and mashed them into 1 game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was going to wait to buy but Cam Banks was such a sweet person who was justifiably passionate about his work that he immediately sold us on the possibilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I haven\u2019t played but it looks and reads amazingly. I have high hopes. But of course I\u2019m not qualified to review or recommend yet. I\u2019m just excited from what I\u2019ve seen so far. Cam Banks and Josh Roby (design leads) deserve quite a bit of praise for taking such a bold step from the previously conservative CORTEX base system. And if you dislike Smallville (so do I mostly) you can still use it like PTA to run most TV soap opera and character over plot driven shows.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish the book credited its systematic influences but to be fair I don\u2019t think non indie games like Mouse Guard do either (but I could be wrong here).<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides buying a promising new game\u2026 Smallville also united long lost family members at Gencon!<br/>\n<br/>\nTiara Lynn Agresta provided art and creative direction for Smallville. My best friend who I came to Gencon with is also named Agresta. Coincidence? Turns out\u2026 not! Tiara is married to my friend Lou\u2019s cousin who he has never met till now!

But a few preview copies did\u2026<br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QO6Iu5ctXMk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QO6Iu5ctXMk</a><br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zi694Zs26PM" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zi694Zs26PM</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIt\u2019s pretty neat. You can play solo or up to 5 players cooperatively, no GM. Setup is minor because unlike Descent which I like but setup is a pain, you build the board as you play. And it concludes in about an hour!<br/>\n<br/>\nOriginally I thought it was a bit more of an RPG / Boardgame hybrid but it\u2019s pretty much primarily a boardgame and there doesn\u2019t seem to be any obvious way to easily turn it into an RPG.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt\u2019s a fairly streamlined version of 4E. You don\u2019t roll damage, there is no flanking or combat advantage, and leveling up is minimal. But it\u2019s not just 4E stripped down.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf 1 person dies, everyone loses. You share a pool of healing surges and XP. And each class has a special ability that influences teamwork like Fighters giving AC bonuses to allies in their same tile, Wizards give bonuses to attacks and so on. Range is simplified into squares and tiles (which are composed of squares).<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are multiple scenarios and the dungeon is always different. The game includes everything you need from tiles, 40 minis, status/hp/condition tokens, monster/encounter/treasure cards to cards summarizing the rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery character has a pool of powers to choose from (you can choose different powers every game) and when you level up you gain more. There are at will powers, daily powers, and utility powers. And some treasure cards will recharge your dailies.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn your turn you can move/attack, attack/move, or move/move. Some treasures and powers are free actions. Movement works similar to 4E using squares. Most attacks target tiles rather than squares. Defeating monsters give you treasure and you use monster cards to track XP. When you roll a 20 you can spend XP to level up (flip your character card over). You can also spend XP to cancel encounters and other effects.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you explore the dungeon you build it, place tiles, spawn monsters, and if a tile has a black arrow you draw an encounter (usually bad).<br/>\n<br/>\nMonsters, traps, and encounters have scripts that instruct you how they behave. Go down a list of question till one is true and just do what it says! It\u2019s all very intuitive, you rarely need to look any rules up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285355/#Comment_285355" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T20:40:54+00:00" title="August 10, 2010  8:40PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 10, 2010 9:17PM by jenskot.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Jake Norwood's stance, hand combos etc appears to be Wing Chun or maybe Jeet Kune Do.

And since I didn't do this alone, my awesome team and our fabulous playtesters kept me on track and made sure Josh and I weren't left to our own devices.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285407/#Comment_285407" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-11T06:51:13+00:00" title="August 11, 2010  6:51AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rock! <br><br>I'm hoping to give Smallville a try after our mini Apocalypse World campaign.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285450/#Comment_285450" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-11T09:36:09+00:00" title="August 11, 2010  9:36AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rad!

They won in more than half the categories.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow granted, and I\u2019ve talked this to death, I personally think it\u2019s a mistake that Paizo\u2019s Advanced Players Guide Playtest was nominated for the Best Free Product category. Many of my friends work for Paizo and I\u2019m a fan of Paizo as a company but this makes no sense to me. That said I felt the other 12 categories they won in were legitimate. This one instance aside, it was an impressive showcase for Paizo.<br/>\n<br/>\nSaturday night we went to an open gaming party hosted by the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.werecabbages.com/" rel="nofollow">Werecabbages</a> (a freelance RPG writer creative guild) which was one of the few opportunities for Paizo staff to actually play games at Gencon.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeeing my friend Tim walk in with 2 Gold ENnies was awesome! Seeing Rone walk in with 2 Gold ENnies completely unrelated to Paizo (one for best podcast: <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.atomicarray.com/" rel="nofollow">Atomic Array</a>, and best electronic book: The Great City Player\u2019s Guide) was even more awesome.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany people at last year\u2019s Gencon called Pathfinder a temporary trend or that selling adventures isn\u2019t a feasible business model but they\u2019ve smashed all doubts. I don\u2019t even play Pathfinder and prefer 4E but I like these people and am impressed by how they treat their fans.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Paizo room was at times easily as crowded as the RPGA room (where I was treated poorly several times trying to play games but that\u2019s a different story but only made me appreciate Paizo more). And no matter how filled up the Paizo room got, no matter if all the games were full\u2026 they would find a table for you anywhere close by and call up a GM to run for you. They even had a computer / printer station so you can quickly create any character you want to play. Even better, they offered frequent free demos where you can earn special cards that you can take with you to full games and cash in for mechanical bonuses. Kick ass in a free demo and then use your +10 to any roll card in any of their official events. Brilliant! I don\u2019t even play Pathfinder but I was blown away.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnrelated to Paizo, I was excited to see John Harper win a best free product silver ENnie for Lady Blackbird and Pelgrane Press win a silver for Trail of Cthulhu: Armitage Files... which I bought and will talk about later (it's pretty damn special and I'm excited to run it).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285547/#Comment_285547" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-11T13:18:00+00:00" title="August 11, 2010  1:18PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 11, 2010 1:20PM by jenskot.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure what going on with that tail (or the general branding, I kept hearing...

Even better, it would be cool if Jared designed it so I could just play :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285773/#Comment_285773" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-12T09:08:28+00:00" title="August 12, 2010  9:08AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I look forward to the other 80% of the fun, whenever you get to post it up, John.<br><br>This thread is keen.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286565/#Comment_286565" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-15T19:58:21+00:00" title="August 15, 2010  7:58PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 15, 2010 7:59PM by jenskot.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can now download the basic rulebook <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/files/Castle%20RavenloftRuleBook.pdf" rel="nofollow">here...</a><br><br>It's supposed to come out this Tuesday.

Hell, I still have problems with it. But it\u2019s a big deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe talk about making games that quickly teach new people how to play. Where you start right away and fill in the details as you push forward. Where the instructions are easy and fun to read. And everything you need is in one place, easy to use\u2026 just start playing!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is it.<br/>\n<br/>\nD&amp;D; \u201cRed Box\u201d or \u201cEssentials\u201d or now \u201cStarter Set\u201d\u2026<br/>\n<br/>\n<img alt="51I8szrbaAL._SS500_.jpg" class="bbcode_img" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51I8szrbaAL._SS500_.jpg"/><br/>\n<br/>\nI played at Gen Con and this is what I wanted D&amp;D; 4E to be from day one!<br/>\n<br/>\nI felt the representatives at the RPGA / Wizards of the Coast Demo room treated me and others poorly on several occasions at Gen Con and I\u2019ve been hugely critical of 4E. But any negative feelings I have feel empty compared to how excited I am for this. I\u2019m going to try my best to put my feelings aside and really dig deep into what this is and isn\u2019t with some of my observations \u201creading between the marketing lines\u201d.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, Wizards has a plan. We may not agree with them but they have a sharp focus and are moving forward with vision and confidence.<br/>\n<br/>\n24 Million people have played D&amp;D; in the last 30+ years. It\u2019s estimated around 6 million people roleplay now. And that 6 million is fairly scattered across multiple games, editions, and many of them play without ever needing to buy anything (which is a bonus to playing tabletop RPGs).<br/>\n<br/>\nExtrapolating on conversations I\u2019ve had with people at Barnes &amp; Nobles and tracking Amazon.com sales, my guess is they\u2019ve sold 10,000+ copies of the PHB1 (stand alone and in the gift box) through Amazon and 200,000+ through physical retail stores. I\u2019m probably way off! But even if the numbers are less or several times more, that\u2019s still far below the 24 Million people who have played D&amp;D.;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Starter Set is aimed at new players and returning players. But I think it\u2019s really about returning players and their families. There is a reason why so much of our childhood from the 70s and 80s is being regurgitated in today\u2019s media. They are re-selling us our childhood and hoping we do the same to our kids. And it\u2019s easier to re-sell us than to convince new people with no connection to buy in. And there are 24 million of us! Just look at the new cover image above. Not even the red box part but the image of the dragon. They replaced the originally planned standard 4E cover art with art from the original redbox. None of it is by accident.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the strategy doesn\u2019t stop at nostalgia. They are going all the way with this!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt\u2019s $20, a box set containing everything you need to start playing now, will be sold at Target, and will feature an advertising campaign on Hulu.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe price tag may be a relative loss leader but it\u2019s truly designed as a long term investment in the hobby\u2019s health. And with many Barnes and Nobles expanding (in some cases tripling) the size of their Board / Card Games sections, the box set is perfectly designed to be featured prominently in their open floor space rather than hidden away in the RPG bookshelf section.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt\u2019s a small box but I was impressed by what I found inside. <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.gameshqonline.com/?p=351" rel="nofollow">Here\u2019s a photo gallery unpacking the contents</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt includes a 32 page player book that says \u201cread this first\u201d. <b>You play a solo\u2026 \u201cchoose your own adventure\u201d mini-game and as you answer questions, you make your character step by step while fighting goblins and learning how to play!</b> Seriously!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt starts with goblins attacking a merchant\u2019s wagon that you and your friends are riding in. A goblin arrow sinks into the merchant\u2019s chest while the goblins surround you with weapons drawn making it clear they want to steal the wagon after dispatching you. The book asks\u2026 what you do? Followed by a few options\u2026 do you imagine pulling a weapon from the wagon and attacking the goblins? Do you imagine drawing a dagger, circling around the wagon, using it for cover, and striking stealthily? Do you imagine wielding magic? Tending to the merchant\u2019s wound? Depending on your answer, you start building your character as you play out the fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt event has an option, \u201cdo you imagine hiding behind the wagon till the fight is over?\u201d And instead of building the \u201ccoward\u201d class, the book talks about what D&amp;D; is and isn\u2019t. Mainly that it\u2019s about heroism and what that means. Crazy!<br/>\n<br/>\nSay you chose to pull out a dagger and stealth. The book walks you through statting up your dexterity and dagger skill. Then describes drawing your dagger in the fiction and defining what it means mechanically (a minor move). Then as you move behind the wagon it introduces move actions. They want to minimize the work you have to do before finding out what\u2019s fun about D&amp;D.; Brilliant!<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is also a group step by step character creation adventure which I didn\u2019t have a chance to see. The box additionally includes a 64 page DM book, several adventures, die-cut character and monster tokens, character sheets, power cards, a double sided dungeon map, and dice!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt\u2019s meant for 1-5 players, supports levels 1-3, and you can play dwarves, elves, halfings, humans, clerics, fighters, rogues, and wizards.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt Gen Con Wizards repeatedly said that the Starter Set was not replacing 4E. But there are enough rule changes that compatibility became a repeated question at Gen Con. Technically everything is compatible. But the races and classes in the Starter Set are the same as in the 4E books in name but not statistically and power wise. Although I didn\u2019t see them, skill challenges have changed yet again, encounter powers are simplified and sometimes have miss effects, and I\u2019ve been told daily powers have been dropped (although I thought Wizards still had them but I may be wrong). The base numbers behind the game use the updated errata found in PHB3 and MM3.<br/>\n<br/>\nWizards stated they are not dropping the PHB, MM, and DMG. Although it\u2019s unclear to me how someone introduced via the Starter Set would move into playing the larger game. Many of the books before PHB3 and MM3 need updates and errata to be compatible with the Starter Set or even the current 4E books. Say I level my Starter Set fighter to 3rd level and want to go to 4th and buy the PHB1 to do so, it looks like I would run into problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nI\u2019m definitely going to buy the Starter Set but I decided not to buy Darksun at Gen Con since I\u2019m unclear where the game is headed (if I was starting a new 4E campaign today, given the errata, I probably wouldn\u2019t use my original PHB and MM books and stick to the DDI for most of my up to date information).<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, Wizards is releasing quite a bit of product, some related to the Starter Set and some unrelated. And they announced next year\u2019s Darksun will be Ravenloft. <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://critical-hits.com/2010/08/07/gen-con-2010-dd-new-products-seminar/" rel="nofollow">More details here\u2026</a><br/>\n<br/>\nBottom line, the Starter Set is full of innovation that I would love to see borrowed by Story Games and if I meet anyone who has never played D&amp;D; but wants to learn, I would point them immediately to the new Red Box.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286734/#Comment_286734" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-16T10:44:55+00:00" title="August 16, 2010 10:44AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I should add, if you don't like most of D&amp;D; 4E, the Starter Set won't change that.

Though i must wonder why this style ever went out of fashion.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving never played an introductory box set it was incredibly hard to get a d20 game started. when i heard that play through an old boxset from the \u201cgame on\u201d podcast ( episode 17 \u201cDead men do tell tales\u201d.) i knew why it was so hard for me to learn, because today's main stream designers were not teaching me with the same tools they were thought with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_287194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287194/#Comment_287194" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T09:47:42+00:00" title="August 18, 2010  9:47AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tyler, great observations. I\u2019m not sure why supporting introductory products that assume no experience and walk you through step by step doesn\u2019t stay in fashion. But it looks like Wizards is seriously looking to address this. Part of the plan with the Starter Set and the Essentials Line is to communicate to retailers that no matter what else Wizards sells, keep these books in stock and featured first. <br><br>Why these types of products go out of style probably has to do with who is in charge of the business at the time and how well the business is doing. Generally when business is good, some companies assume they don\u2019t need to allocate too much attention to new or old customers and instead focus on existing ones. It\u2019s easy to do and less of a risk. But I also think it\u2019s too short term focused. Usually people do things \u201cjust in time\u201d rather than before things get bad. <br><br>The same happens in comic books. When comics aren\u2019t doing well and need more customers, they try to make stories more episodic or include a story synopsis at the beginning of each issue so anyone can jump right in. Or they make sure in the first 6 pages Wolverine makes reference to the fact that he\u2019s a mutant, has adamantium claws, and a healing factor (or shows these in action). The content of the stories also change to become friendlier. But when business is good, it\u2019s seductive to focus on how great things are now and how easy it is to succeed verses planning for the future. <br><br>It\u2019s fascinating to see this happen in Wrestling. WWF/WWE was more of a live action cartoon for kids in the 80s but instead of trying to appeal to younger kids they focused on making the content more adult as their young fans grew up. Which was very successful for them! But they didn\u2019t simultaneously focus on new fans in anticipation of old fans losing interest (and if you are trying to be more adult, it\u2019s hard to compete with the UFC) or starting families and having less money to spend. Now they switched to trying to appeal to kids again with PG content and it\u2019s slowly working but they are in a mad rush to catch up. Their TV time slot can be difficult for children to catch, and they\u2019ve worked their name recognition wrestlers into the ground who are constantly being injured rather than building younger stars who will be more relatable to the new audience. A younger audience also means more people attending live events but possible less PPV buys so the basic business plan also needs to shift. They are doing a pretty good job of fixing this but I believe they would have been in an even better position if they started 4 years ago. But I\u2019m making a lot of assumptions and don\u2019t have access to their financial information beyond quarterly reports. It\u2019s easy to be a back seat driver and speculate when it\u2019s not my money on the line!                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287988/#Comment_287988" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-20T21:31:42+00:00" title="August 20, 2010  9:31PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So new DnD Red Box "Finnaly DnD is as good as it was 20 years ago" <img alt=":p" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/tongue.png" title=":p"/><br/>\n<br/>\nMy guess as to why the intro stuff stopped? sales, popularity of tolken, why would old player's buy an intro box set for a new edition?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think if they had made a "red box" for saga edition star wars it would have been a better choice. as a new player who was way more interested in playing star wars then Tolkien trying to absorb how to play d20 from the saga core rule book was really really hard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288346/#Comment_288346" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-23T13:34:39+00:00" title="August 23, 2010  1:34PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Red Box for Star Wars is a fabulous idea!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288347/#Comment_288347" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-23T13:36:36+00:00" title="August 23, 2010  1:36PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've only gone through half my Gen Con notes.
