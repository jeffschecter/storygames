But it is <i>extremely good</i> at old-school console RPGs. Let's look at some of the similarities:<br/><br/>-- Linear story lines with minimal room for variation. Crono Trigger had a grand total of 12 different endings, plus the "You Lose" screen, and that was considered amazing. 4E requires you to have actual maps combined with carefully orchestrated enemies to work well, and so your choices are "do the encounter as scripted" or "light the DM's prep on fire."<br/><br/>-- Extremely limited move set. While Gau in Final Fantasy 6 could do over 250 unique moves thanks to the Rage system, Sabin pre-Esper is limited to "punch a dude," "punch a dude with a special command input," "body slam a dude," "chi blast," "use an item," and "run like hell." In the Seiken Densetsu games (Secret of Mana is one), featured as a screenshot in the game pitch, you can attack, use an item, or use one of 8 spells. One of the three characters in Secret of Mana can't use spells at all! The Legend of Zelda originally appeared on a console with only two buttons on the controller. Meanwhile, in 4E, I seriously was able to copy all the text (fluff included) of all my moves out of a PDF and fit it onto a single side of a sheet of paper. The other side had my complete character sheet in one column and my backstory in the other.<br/><br/>-- Emphasis on local tactics rather than large-scale strategy or logistics. Console RPGs use maps and encounter setups that make high-level strategy impossible but small-scale tactics interesting - the encounters are probably random, the enemies don't even exist until the moment you find them, and Emperor Ghestal is going to screw the world over for power without possibility of recourse or reconsideration. The longest range attack in 4E is less than a football field, but holy crap is moving a couple of squares a big deal, and convincing the King to outlaw slavery is either impossible or an exercise in DM fiat.<br/><br/>-- Limited room for character variation. In both console games and 4E, there is simply not a mechanical base that allows you to do things outside of the particular niches that are already for you. In Final Fantasy 6, you can try to make Sabin into a mage, and you will succeed if you are willing to grind monsters endlessly, but it's not a very useful or optimal path. In 4E, you can try to make a Halfling Fighter with a 10 in Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution, but you will be hard-pressed to be useful against level-appropriate enemies.<br/><br/>That all sounds awful by the usual standards I see on story-games.com. But, those old games are fun. I still think they're fun. I'm playing Final Fantasy 6 again now, and I first played it over 15 years ago. The extreme limits of space and technology forced writers to compress their stories into a form like haiku, compact and elegant, and there's good fun to be had there. Extreme limits can by liberating, in contrast to the tyranny of the empty page.<br/><br/>Of course, the core gameplay of those console games, either menu-based or real-time, is the same gameplay we have today in modern games, and was executed as well then as now. Stabbing dudes in Zelda is fun. Stabbing dudes in 4E is also fun. It is a similar fun, and not very deep, but it holds up well to the test of time. So 4E also brings that to the table                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212793">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212793/#Comment_212793" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-17T00:06:03+00:00" title="June 17, 2009 12:06AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good points, one and all.

I'd have to blow it wide open for strategic level action as well, otherwise the tactical and craft parts would feel like too much work just to represent a linear campaign for others.

Honestly, I've been searching for an idiom that makes 4E work for me, because the kind of roleplaying I normally like running is much more player-driven, narratively, and also relatively low-prep.  4E is neither, really.  <br/><br/>The earlier encounters I was trying to prep just seemed overwhelming to even think about, especially making well-designed, full-color maps from scratch with interesting terrain.  The commercial dungeon tiles are okay, I guess, but honestly seem pretty boring in many ways.  They are not highly interactive, they have no moving parts, a lot of them are more or less the same, etc. Their most interesting feature is difficult terrain, it seems.  But being able to hack old school video game maps (which are already layed out in tiles and are already well designed, with interesting features and clever layouts) makes all that a lot easier.  <br/><br/>Also, I can rationalize the relatively low-level of player driven plots and limited narrative branching if I try to imagine the game as a CRPG or Zelda game.  That seems easier to me than trying to force 4E to be much more flexible, just because I hate the idea of improvizing maps on whiteboards and the like, based on whatever the players decide to do. The game, in my mind, seems largely about moving colorful tokens around on full color maps.  That's where the color and imagery lives.  Doing it on a whiteboard would kill that dead for me, I think.  So what I'd rather do is throw down some maps and let the players decide how to approach a fixed set of challenges (sneaking? throwing switches? frontal assault? intimidation? etc.).  Again, this opens up small scale tactics while closing off large-scale strategy.<br/><br/>Similarly, small-scale character moments happen, rather than the players choosing large-scale ones like, um, "I'm going to hunt down the man who killed my father," and sending the game off in a different direction.  For example, there was a mini-cutscene where Melia and Genia left Korin standing next to the plaque at the end of the first encounter.  And Dev gave her a very short monologue of a few lines about the relationship between herself and her mysterious ancestor, the Gravesinger.  That was awesome, as a form of player expression of character, but, yeah, much smaller scale than you see in most indie RPGs.  "My ancestor is the Gravesinger?  I wonder what that means for me..."<br/><br/>But, this was only prep and the first session.  Hopefully these kinds of things will become clearer as we play more, including whether we can open things up a bit and make the game significantly less linear.  I'm just worried that'll require me to prep a while bunch of different maps and components beforehand, whipping out the ones for whichever encounter the players decide to do first.  Maybe if they decided what they wanted to do next at the end of one session, so I could design the components for the next session based on their decisions?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212852/#Comment_212852" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-17T07:24:55+00:00" title="June 17, 2009  7:24AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 17, 2009 7:26AM by J_Walton.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Map 3, Tomb Interior part 1.

Rests, healing surges, and items can be used to heal damage as normal.  You can't roll the same skill or use the same power twice before deciding to end the skill challenge.

It doesn't have a giant boss with multiple moving parts (next time), but just has a bunch of layers showing different aspects of the environment changing as the fight progresses. If I have to, I can print it out, it'll just take a lot of pages to have all the different possible combinations of layers, just in the rare event that we might need a weird one (the boss is on fire and frozen at the same time!).<br/><br/>An idea I had was just to pull up the map in Photoshop, on my laptop, and manipulate it there during the fight, having PC and monster tokens on separate layers and moving them around during the fight. The only problem is that having the players cluster around my shoulders and point at my laptop screen doesn't sound that exciting. John Harper said I should get a projector and I thought about getting a video cable and plugging into a TV, so it would really look like we were playing a console game, but both of those are hard to do at Pandemonium, the local game store where we play.  I could also just put a piece of clear plastic over my screen and we could gently place tokens on the computer screen itself, but my screen is only readable from certain angles, unlike a TV.<br/><br/>Thoughts? Suggestions?  I guess I want to see how much of a pain this kind of thing is before deciding whether to use it again in a future boss encounter.  If it's too much of a hassle, I'll stick to stuff I can just print out.  The cool thing about it is that I could export an image after each turn and keep a running set of slides of the encounter, which would be like stop-motion video of play, more or less.<br/><br/>Those mythical iTablets can't get here fast enough.

And I don't know how to print semi-transparent stuff.  The mist is actually the problem because I have, for example:<br/><br/>Slide 1. A room with a statue in it that the players can destroy.<br/>Slide 2. Same room, with destroyed statue.<br/>Slide 3. Same room, filled with mist.<br/>Slide 4. Same room, with destroyed status and filled with mist.<br/><br/>That's four maps for 1 room, which seems like overkill, but the layering of the statue/mist makes it hard to do it any other way.<br/><br/>Glad you like it, Bret.

It was pretty awesome.  Here's a recap of the rooms, which you can map to the photo above:<br/><br/><b>Room 1 (far right): Mummies.</b> Eric's tiefling warlock, Malia, snuck in first and set one on fire with her mind.  Unfortunately, it lurked right next to the door and got an opportunity attack as Dev's dwarf warden, Korin, came in.  We decided they did 7 damage instead of 5 when they were on fire. This encounter was great and was paced just right.<br/><br/><b>Room 2: Skeletons &amp; Bats.</b> Eben's gnome bard, Genia, was the hero of this one, pushing one skeleton into the pit and luring another into trying to jump across.  The second skeleton failed and also fell in.  All in all, this encounter was a bit slow and fairly static due to lack of room to move. Bats probably should have been minions with high AC/Reflex making them hard to hit instead of having 10 HP. Having three skeletons only worked because two fell into the pit.  Malia teleporting to the other side of the pit was cool.  As they polished off the remaining bats, the gnoll chieftain known as The Great Rondu and his bodyguard, Marshall, came in through the left skull door, bounded across the pit, and jeered at them before advancing through the dungeon ahead of them.  Then Korin heaved Genia across the pit and Dev took 10 to leap his own character across.  <br/><br/><b>Room 3, Part A: Right Side Ghosts.</b> Since their way forward was blocked, the group decided to try the right side of the room first (since it didn't involve the pit and the moving platform). Both of the key-shaped strings of blocks were being circled by three floating dwarven ghosts moving at a speed of two along a fixed path.  Genia and Korin approached one of the ghosts, tried to make a Diplomacy check, and rolled low.  The ghost merely recited the rhyme it had been give to say:<br/><br/><i>This tomb was sealed in days of old<br/>Once with amethyst, twice with rose<br/>For those who seek what the Gravesinger stole<br/>Once with amethyst, twice with rose</i><br/><br/>Having tried that, Genia decided to just trying walking past the ghosts towards the three switches and the treasure chest that they surely opened.  Meanwhile, the Great Rondu and Marshall were trying and failing to get the chest to open, because they could only stand on two switches at the same time.  However, as Genia moved past the first ghost, it turned and attacked her.  Korin rushed to her defense and soon the group was fighting all three ghosts, because the other ghosts joined in the scrum as they came around on their fixed path and found their movement blocked. Unfortunately for the group, the dwarven ghosts were each 4th level skirmishers with 40 HP, because I figured the group wouldn't fight all of them. Oh well. They hacked their way through, though Dev had Korin drink the group's only potion (gained after the gnoll fight, I think). Once defeated, the three ghosts faded back into the three skulls hanging on the wall (which I thought was a nice little design touch on my part).<br/><br/>There was a short cutscene where the Great Rondu ordered Marshall, a minion, to attack the group, but the gnoll bodyguard was easily bested and the two gnolls booked a hasty retreat over towards the other treasure chest.  Then the group opened the chest, stepping on the three switches, and gained the Amethyst Dagger, a warlock implement that grains the user concealment against everyone under the warlock's curse. Malia naturally equipped it right away.<br/><br/><b>Room 3, Part B: Left Side Ghosts.</b> On the other side of the room, the group quickly tried to formulate a plan, but ended up largely winging it and not having things go off exactly as they wanted.  The floating platform could be moved one space in any direction as a minor action, but only by characters currently on top of the platform. Initially, Malia stepped on and moved it towards the far side, running straight into a ghost, but planning on avoiding the attentions of the other two by moving quickly.  Then Genia leaped onto the platform and spent another minor action to keep moving it forward. Dev had Korin move around to the small opening on the right wall, planning on squeezing through once the platform was in position on the far side. However, Korin ended up being right next to the path of one of the ghosts coming around the corner (small oversight on the group's part) and, soon enough, Korin had marked both ghosts and was drawing them out of the path of the third. Another slog ensued, but doing away with two ghosts was easier than three.<br/><br/>Once again, the Great Rondu told Marshall to kill the party and once again Marshall was easily driven back.  This time, the gnolls leaped over the wall (which they can do as computer-controlled characters) and hid behind the lion statues.  The characters opened the second treasure chest and obtained the Rose Baton, a bard-implement (sense the pattern?) that grants +2 damage bonus to one ally after a rest.<br/><br/>to be continued...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215522/#Comment_215522" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T15:06:01+00:00" title="June 30, 2009  3:06PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Quite entertaining.

Today we completed the following:<br/><br/><b>Room 3, Part C: Mini-Boss Fight (M. Tiger).</b> The players proceeded up to the lion statues, which also had the ghost's poem written on the base. Malia stood right next to one statue and touched it with the Amethyst Dagger while Genia stood a ways back and waved the Rose Baton at the other. Both statues exploded, doing 5 fire damage to Malia (which she soaked, being a tiefling) and bringing the characters face to face with the gnolls once more. Retreating back into Room 4, the Great Rondu told Marshall to once again kill the party but reminded the gnoll bodyguard to "drink your potion this time!"  Marshall complied and sudden swelled into the giant tiger-looking sprite you see neat the top-center of the photo. Eric suggested that the mini-boss's name be changed to "M. Tiger," which sounded great to me.<br/><br/>This fight was actually way cooler than I anticipated.  I based super-Marshall's stats on the Fae Panther from the MM, which gave him a teleport 5 move action that the players initially had no idea about and a charge attack that knocked victims back 2 squares.  So M. Tiger began by charging forward and knocking characters steadily backwards down the narrow, 2-square corridor in the center of Room 3.  Genia and Malia, seeing how this was going, backed into Room 2 and shot at M. Tiger through the door with ranged attacks. Korin initially braced the door by herself, figuring that the mini-boss would have to squeeze to fit through the door, giving combat advantage. However, M. Tiger then used teleport to enter Room 2 and all hell broke loose.<br/><br/>Genia leaped across the pit and started sniping at the boss from the other side.  Korin moved around to the right of the mini-boss, hoping to bullrush M. Tiger and knock him into the pit. However, his bullrush sputtered and the mini-boss's attack knocked him back in the far corner with Malia.  Of course, since Korin had marked M. Tiger with her warden class ability, that meant the mini-boss was advancing on both of them, rendering Malia's concealment and invisibility powers increasingly moot. Luckily M. Tiger was finally dispatched before things got even thornier for the party.<br/><br/><b>Room 4: Secret Tomb Puzzle.</b> Moving into the next room, they encountered the ghost of one of Svartalfaheim's ancient kings. He informed them that, having unlocked the amethyst and rose seal, they were entitled to the greatest treasure ever known to dwarvenkind... but he couldn't really remember where it was.  Something about a secret chamber that could only be reached by fire. Genia and Malia quickly set about lighting the torches in the four corners of the room, but the king said: "That's better, but not quite enough, I think. Clearly we need <i>even more fire</i>." They tried to light the skull-shaped stone blocking their path on fire, but that really didn't work. Since there wasn't much else in the room, Korin picked up the rug and looked under it, but there wasn't a trapdoor or pit there.  In the end, Malia set the rug on fire with her mind and the flames leapt up, forming a burning doorway in the form of a flaming portrait of the king.<br/><br/>I placed the map tile for the secret tomb on the table and then placed a copy of the flaming portrait on the wall, opposite the king's ghost (which had moved to the secret tomb when the portal opened) and a treasure chest that stood in front of an alcove holding the king's bones. Malia jumped through the portal first, not afraid of some fire damage. Korin jumped through after, getting singed a bit. Genia waited in Room 4.  Malia tried to open the treasure chest first, but it was apparently sealed against all evil, demonic things and, being a tiefling, she couldn't open it.  But Korin did, obtaining the Skull Hammer, which dealt +1 necrotic damage and, as an Encounter power on a successful hit, half the original damage as Wall 3 thunder damage, proceeding as a shockwave from the first target. <br/><br/>On a successful Arcane roll, Malia learned and explained that the Skull Hammer was effectively the "Master Sword" from the original <i>Untervolkstum</i> game, a weapon of great evil obtained and tamed by the Gravesinger before they fought the evil sorcerer. During the original game, the Gravesinger cleaned out this dungeon, which originally contained a great evil, and turned it into the royal tombs, but some evil had managed to sneak back in through the cracks in the 1000 years since the original game ended.  In any event, Korin was able to use the Skull Hammer to destroy the skull-shaped stone blocking their path, and they proceeded to the boss-fight in the final chamber.<br/><br/>to be continued...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215551/#Comment_215551" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T15:56:56+00:00" title="June 30, 2009  3:56PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, doesn't seem like that much work to me, but I'm just doing an hour here and there.  I'm also in the process of writing up a product for One Bad Egg, Hard Boiled Pixels, that lays out my methods and some tricks for other people to use, so it's work as well as play, I guess.<br/><br/>Some of the small things, like the "Item Screen" card to the top right on that picture and most of the enemies, are just ripped straight from Zelda or Final Fantasy, printed out, cut out, and boom, right there on the table directly.  Those aren't much work at all.  And the modification and map-building doesn't necessarily have to be extensive.  I was just pushing it pretty hard because I wanted to see what the capabilities were and what kinds of things you could emulate effectively at the table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215554/#Comment_215554" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T16:06:52+00:00" title="June 30, 2009  4:06PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            BTW, here's the flaming rug and portal made of fire connecting to the secret tomb.

I can't take full credit for the maps, since they're built from things ripped from Zelda: Minish Cap, but some of things I did have to hack together from various bits.  For the OBE product, I'm gonna be custom-building a set of Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial tiles that'll be included in the product, so people can use them to build their own maps and trade them around.  That process is going to be awesome but much, much harder than anything I've done so far.<br/><br/>Eero, hope so.  It's gonna take a while, though, because we're probably only gonna get through 1-2 more dungeons or here (up to Level 4, maybe) before I have to pack up and move, so I'll have to start a new game out in Seattle to test the rest of the product.  Luckily, though, finding players shouldn't be too hard if I wave some pretty maps around.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215611/#Comment_215611" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T21:25:33+00:00" title="June 30, 2009  9:25PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>cc, really?</p>\n<p>You do such good work and you're going to do <em>that?</em></p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215612/#Comment_215612" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T21:36:05+00:00" title="June 30, 2009  9:36PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those ready-made tiles sound quite... <i>awesome</i>, I think is the word.

Rondu jumped down the stairs to attack, but his stats were basically those of a Gnoll Clawfighter from MM, so he was very easily dispatched. Because of that and because they clearly hadn't beaten the final boss (they hadn't leveled up!), the players became very wary.  <br/><br/>Malia read the small plaque near the line of skull blocks (hard to see on the large map above), which said: "In case of catastrophe, break floor."  Dev had Korin break one of the skull blocks, only to find a cracked floor tile underneath.  Smashing the tile, Korin uncovered a gaping pit like the two they'd previously discovered in the dungeon, not really a useful exit. Then Genia made an Arcane check to decipher the tablet, which had a keyhole and an inscription that said, if opened, a magic force would be unleashed that would wash the tombs clean of evil influences.  Not wanting to leave the skull blocks, in case she needed to break more, Korin tossed the Skull Key (passed down from her father) to Genia and the gnome opened the tablet's seal. <br/><br/><b>Room 5, Part B: Boss Fight (Fae Rays).</b> Instantly, magic water began pouring into the room at an alarming rate, filling the room and, in fact, filling the entire dungeon up to the characters' waists, making the whole thing difficult terrain unless players made a successful swim check.  There were two currents in the water, pulling characters either towards the door they came in (towards Room 4, where the flaming portal had been doused by the water) or towards the hole in the floor that Korin had broken open.  Dev had placed Korin right in front of that hole but luckily, as a dwarf, Korin could decide whether to be pulled or not (that was not something I'd thought of and was, in fact, pure awesome). Then, along with the water, three giant fae-touched stingrays swam through the pouring water into the room. Two of them looked normal, but one had a black-widow-style diamond symbol on its forehead. The boss had finally arrived!<br/><br/>The boss fight was, in general, pretty cool, though not quite as eventful as the mini-boss fight.  Genia hopped up on the raised platform, Malia hopped up on the skull blocks, and Korin was the only character slugging it out in the water with the rays, but, as a dwarf tank, that was ideal for her.  The rays (who, between the three of them, had the stats of a Young Black Dragon) were threatening without being a slog, but the coolest part, I think, was the way I handled damaging them.  Just like you would expect in a console game, hitting one of the rays caused it to flip over on its belly and flail around helplessly until its next turn, when it flipped back over and could attack you again. While a ray was flipped over, it was subject to the currents -- just like the characters -- and could be hit on a mere 10 vs. AC/Reflex, rather than it's normal high scores.  Conseqently, over several turns, both of the lesser rays managed to get flipped over and sucked down the hole in the floor near Korin.  And, by keeping it flipped as much as possible, the party smashed its way through all 110HP of the main boss ray.  Victory!  Massive hearts dropped from the sky and everyone leveled up.<br/><br/>And that led into the next puzzle and skill challenge: getting out of the water-filled tombs.  But I'll wait and post about that tomorrow.  Here's some recreated pictures of the boss fight (not from actual play, sadly).  The first is the room filling with water after Genia broke the seal...<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://plays-well.com/de-waterroom.jpg"/><br/><br/>... and the second is Korin getting swarmed by two rays while Malia and Genia stab one of the flipped-over ones (which never actually happened, but could have).<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://plays-well.com/de-rays.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215615/#Comment_215615" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T21:49:55+00:00" title="June 30, 2009  9:49PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Shreyas, well, CC means that I can still release future commercial products using those tiles sets if I want to, just that what other people make with them has to be shared for free.  I just don't want folks to be like "Uh, here's a tile set I can't legally use for anything?"  But I might do something else too, since I'm working with Justin on this product and he's a lawyer.<br/><br/>Eero, yeah, the custom-built tile sets will be included in a few different forms and one of them will definitely be some sample dungeon rooms that you can arrange into maps.  My plan is to include a dungeon tile set, an overland tile set, a world map tile set, and some sprites for monsters and magic items.  But that's ambitious so we'll see what I actually end up making.  I already have a theme and name in mind for the sample set, <i>Bridge of Heaven: Broken Rainbow</i>, the idea being that the Bifrost Bridge has been shattered and all color drained from the world.  So the characters travel through a black and white Gameboy world slowly recovering the lost colors from dungeons (and bringing color back into the world), reassembling the Bridge of Heaven and storming back into Asgard to fight the villain responsible (Loki? Not sure yet). That's probably the 4E game I'm gonna run in Seattle, to try out the tiles.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215619/#Comment_215619" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T22:14:07+00:00" title="June 30, 2009 10:14PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Well, I mean, "make maps for your game at home" <em>is a thing.</em> It's the most important thing!

I'd have worked on one sooner, but there's a lot of craziness to get ready to go.<br/><br/>Also, ultimately, after our fourth and final session of this mini-campaign today, I have to say that, in the end, I've been substantially disappointed with 4th Edition overall, not in the ways it handled the 16-bit hacking (those were fine) but just as a game system that was fun to play in an of itself.  Generally speaking, the stuff I found really exciting and interesting about our play had very little to do with the mechanics of D&amp;D (it was stuff we brought to the table ourselves) and, when we did engage the mechanics, they frequently served to make the game less fun instead of more fun.  So my conclusion is basically: 16-bit maps and sprites for fantasy roleplaying are AWESOME, but I'm less convinced of the awesome of 4th.  To be fair, I'm even less convinced of the awesome of 3.0/3.5, so it may be that these two styles of D&amp;D just aren't my thing. <br/><br/>Still, there do seem to be a lot of problems in 4th that seem to be fundamental, rather than just judgment calls.  Fights turn into 6+ round slogs very easily, even at low levels.  Level-appropriate encounters don't seem to be very exciting at all, period.  Certain subsystems of the game (healing, concealment) seem to never really materialize unless you go out of your way to emphasize them. Prep is insanely time consuming considering the amount of enjoyment that comes out of it.  Assigning magic items and treasure is purely arbitrary and way too much work.  Skill challenges are really poorly designed.  Etc.  I realize this may be old news to lots of people, but this is the first time I've gotten to do substantial play of D&amp;D (of any variety) and I have to admit that I'm shocked by how much the game is lacking in basic guidelines on how to effectively run and play it.  You can't simply create a level appropriate encounter, throw it on the map, and expect to have a good time, but improvizing and hacking level-appropriate material is both time consuming and difficult.  Maybe I just need to play it more or something, but I feel like a game that I don't "get" after 4 sessions of play is asking for too much of a commitment without promising substantial payoff in the end.<br/><br/>So, yeah, I really want to do more 16-bit style play in the end, but I think doing it with 4th might take way more hacking that it's worth.  I'm planning on trying to find something else to use as a base instead.  The sketchy battle maps of the Primitive / Danger Patrol school might be a good place to start looking, perhaps, and John Harper suggested I take another look at The Magical Land of Yeld.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218321/#Comment_218321" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-14T14:50:43+00:00" title="July 14, 2009  2:50PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan,<br/><br/>I am sad 4E didn't work out! I know you probably meant this, but I'd like to add for the sake of clarity that the above statements should have "for me" added to them. There's not fundamental problems in the game as a factual thing that we can point at and say, "Yep, fundamentally busted," but there are things that are fundamentally busted for what you wanted. Is that a fair statement, or do you mean actually fundamentally busted? I ask only because I'm having a really fantastic time in both my 4E games, and they're all using basic, un-hacked level-appropriate encounters.                        </div>\n<div

not entirely sure yet.  I know some people play 4E (or D&amp;D in general) and consistently have a great time, but I haven't had that happen for me yet, either when I was running the game or when other people were running it for me.  There were moments of really awesome stuff, definitely, but they were interrupted by lots of stuff that wasn't awesome.  And I haven't yet figured out how the isolate the awesome I find in D&amp;D from the non-awesome, without really delving into its guts.  A lot of the non-awesome stuff just seems hardwired into the core rules, like how many HP monsters have (leading to the slog of combat). I am very much willing to play this game some more, with other people running it, to try to figure out why/how it works for other folks and how it might work for me too, but right now I just want to step back from it for a while, because 1) it's not working for me and, worse, 2) I can't figure out how to easily change things so that it will work for me.  And this was really disappointing to me as a newcomer to D&amp;D in general who was excited by the promise of 4th.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mule" title="Mule"><img alt="Mule" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mule">Mule</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218332/#Comment_218332" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-14T17:15:42+00:00" title="July 14, 2009  5:15PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It may be too late, but my advice for the slog of combat is *more monsters.*  I've been disappointed with the pacing of combat involving few monsters myself, so I took to having 5-7 monsters for most of my encounters.  To keep the exp in line they have to be lower level, which means they each individually die faster, *and* having so many monsters on the board generally gives the players more to do with tactical positioning and moving around.  That, or just arbitrarily cut the hitpoints of monsters in half and see how it works out.<br/>\n<br/>\n"The slog of combat" is an interesting thing, though; I've definitely felt it at times.  My best understanding of it is that when a battle is decided but still ongoing, it gets that feeling.  In an brawl where the monsters were all standing after an hour but there was still uncertainty as to the outcome, still genuine tension, I didn't get that sloggy feeling.  Only after the tension is resolved and the combat enters the "mop up the rest" phase do I feel it, and I've been working on ways of structuring combats to eliminate or reduce that as much as possible.  My guess is that the tension of combat is probably variable between groups, and so for one group what is an exciting combat could be a drawn out slog-fest for another.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo Jonathan in particular, though, I just want to say thanks for sharing all these pictures!  They've definitely inspired me to be more creative in my own environment prep.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218334/#Comment_218334" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-14T17:28:53+00:00" title="July 14, 2009  5:28PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 14, 2009 5:29PM by DevP.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I will say: the prevalence of the "monsters get double damage / half hp" rule makes me think that part of the overall 4E equation was a little bit busted (or, at least it leans towards bigger combats being longer). Of course, I understand how this came about: big fights perhaps should feel epic, rather than have a quick "save or be fucked" effect. The debate over which is preferable is left as an exercise for the reader.<br/><br/>Having played through level 1 and a bit of level 2, I'm at least interested enough in playing some more 4E, and sold also on the value of 16-bit stylings for gamers of our generation. (I ran Keep on teh Shadowfell for some friends and my FF1 tokens def helped.) It works for my preference, at least as far as I've played and allowing for some drift towards my own tastes. This just amounts to saying "Square Enix &gt; Erol Otus" for a certain set of people.<br/><br/>No doubt: a lot of the physical/tactical aspects of our game prep were really valuable and I'm interested in seeing JW further explain his methods so that I can steal them and take credit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218337/#Comment_218337" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-14T17:45:11+00:00" title="July 14, 2009  5:45PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My bulletpoint synopsis of the session:<br/><br/>We wash ashore, at alternate corners of an isometric map. n.b. the water is a corrupted/acidic red. (Basically, two cityish areas connected by two bridges.) Korin + Genya are on side, while Melia is on the others; both areas are connected by a bridge. A bit of free play ensues. Melia knocks on one door, where she finds this odd knight do asking Melia whether his blood sacrifice has arrived. (AWKWARD. She walks away.) Korin + Genya are surrounded by some illithids, who ask why they look so alive, given that they are the dead. Obviously, Genya bluffs that they too are among the dead, and just have some sweet illusion spells going on.<br/>The Illithids believe K+G (?!?!) and lend two of their number of help "search for the lost living one" that followed them. Melia, meanwhile, pings the Deathknight with witchfire, which doesn't do nearly enough. Therefore, she runs away, getting the attention of Genya. There is some confusion, as the Deathknight follows on the bridge, and so our clover is a bit blown. It comes out (through the previous cut scenes and during the fight) that the Deathknight has been forcing the Illithids to obey him, while they would rather prevent the Corruption from reaching the living if possible. We initially fight the Illithids, but they soon turn their attentions to the Deathknight. Melia witchfires the bridge, dropping the Deathknight below. ("Glug...")<br/><br/>The Deathknight reappears riding a weird mutated Ray, which is a sort of huge ray merged by several dying rays, with a new "Lure" creature attached to it. (So here we have basically three creatures at once.) The Deathknight rides to shore and immediately starts pinging Genya and bothering the Illithids around it. Korin gets the bright idea of charging forward to land on the ray (I suggest to JW that I stretch the value of my "Mountain Lion Step" to allow for a leap to get me there, and he went with it", and I did an AoE attack that blinded several of its eyes. Soon, the Ray trashed its way to the middle of the bay, while I hung on and did various damage.<br/><br/>Because I'm a bad D&amp;D player who focused a bit on my own tanking and my own combos, I can mainly report on the story of Korin and the Mutant Ray. I hung onto that thing, and while the Lure had an attack for knocking me off the ray / immobilzing me / etc, a combination of good athletics rows / good saving throws / the dwarven ability to ignore 1 sqauares worth of pushes allowed be to basically hang on, continually marking it and doing some damage. I realized I destroyed several eyes with my first strike, so I tried to destroy the rest of them with some other AoE damage (JW went with the idea that my Ice Area Effect would basically finish blinding the creature). Once the Ray was basically blinded, there was some one-and-off damage I did to it, but it was less threatening for Korin, and further away from my squishier allies. The Illithids tried to harpoon the bugger and pull it ashore; it ended up shaking that off, but was a cool effect I would have liked to see more of (especially if I was still ashore). Eventually I got ashore, basically as the Deathknight was finished off.<br/><br/>So meanwhile, Genya and Melia were splitting attention between the Deathknight, the Ray, and occaisionally the Illithids (but generally the first two once it was clear they were no longer hostile). They pinged them at range repeatedly (when possible). There was one really saavy teamup between Genya and Melia, stacking some supporting actions + bonuses + curses + a daily attack + a good plot moment ("Melia pulls back her hood and reveals herself, and the Deathknight realizes it was Melia who killed her in the previous game"), and yet Eric rolled a natural 1, whiffing an otherwise cool finishing moment and stretching the fight out longer. Alas.<br/><br/>Some further grinding/pinging finally took down the Deathknight. We talked with the Illithids as they revealed their involvement with the Deathknight, and basically struck a peace (also opening up a town where could trade if we continued the adventure).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218339/#Comment_218339" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-14T17:52:19+00:00" title="July 14, 2009  5:52PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, see above with that whiff: as a DM, I realize I would crave a rule to basically handwave that roll as too awesome to fail, and perhaps allow a success by perhaps giving myself an action token redeemable in the future or somesuch. It would certainly have been a crowning moment of awesome if not for the whiff.<br/><br/>Beyond that, for my own tastes: I saw how the 4E balance would mean that the party *could* grind out a victory vs level appropriate foes, but I would usually include the equivalent of dropping a magic bridge on a foe to quickly bring them down (or at least, be open to any potential bridge-dropping the players suggest). I think with 4E encounters I'd run, I'd usually have at least one "vulnerability" that the players could feasibly figure out and use, even if they could otherwise hang on for a longer win.<br/><br/>I know I got tactical synergy from Genya (a +2 to damage and +1 to hit, and briefly the change to ping the Ray to get +4 HP in healing). Genya/Melia had a little bit more synergy back on dry land, but it didn't seem to come off quite as much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218350/#Comment_218350" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-14T19:48:13+00:00" title="July 14, 2009  7:48PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like Jonathan is where I'm at with 4th edition, now. Such a promising game, but I'm sort of happy that I don't have the time to play it at length this year.<br/><br/>My standard solution for the combat grind issue in this game has been to entertain some fighting morale rules - have each individual monster try to escape (or at least make some sort of will save) when they get bloodied, and have the whole group escape or surrender when it becomes clear that they have nothing more to gain in the fight. Ideally this means that all but the most important fights end in a round or two, after we've established that the heroes are superior and can basically <i>kill</i> their opposition in exchange for some immediately healed hp loss.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218352/#Comment_218352" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-14T19:58:02+00:00" title="July 14, 2009  7:58PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a DM, I just straight up have the remaining guys turn tail and run once I feel like they're on the losing end.

It doesn't have a giant boss with multiple moving parts (next time), but just has a bunch of layers showing different aspects of the environment changing as the fight progresses. If I have to, I can print it out, it'll just take a lot of pages to have all the different possible combinations of layers, just in the rare event that we might need a weird one (the boss is on fire and frozen at the same time!).<br/><br/>An idea I had was just to pull up the map in Photoshop, on my laptop, and manipulate it there during the fight, having PC and monster tokens on separate layers and moving them around during the fight. The only problem is that having the players cluster around my shoulders and point at my laptop screen doesn't sound that exciting. John Harper said I should get a projector and I thought about getting a video cable and plugging into a TV, so it would really look like we were playing a console game, but both of those are hard to do at Pandemonium, the local game store where we play.  I could also just put a piece of clear plastic over my screen and we could gently place tokens on the computer screen itself, but my screen is only readable from certain angles, unlike a TV.<br/><br/>Thoughts? Suggestions?  I guess I want to see how much of a pain this kind of thing is before deciding whether to use it again in a future boss encounter.  If it's too much of a hassle, I'll stick to stuff I can just print out.  The cool thing about it is that I could export an image after each turn and keep a running set of slides of the encounter, which would be like stop-motion video of play, more or less.<br/><br/>Those mythical iTablets can't get here fast enough. They would make all this so much easier.</blockquote>\n<a href="http://www.penpaperpixel.org/tutorials/tabletopprojection/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.penpaperpixel.org/tutorials/tabletopprojection/</a><br/><br/>Someone sent this to me two years ago.

You need frosted glass for this, and your projector needs to have very specialized short-range optics, but when it works it's breathtaking.
