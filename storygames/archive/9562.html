At cons I hand the players a list of the town's NPCs and ask them to take at least 2 relationships to these NPCs. If players take relationships to the same NPCs, even better!<br/>\n<br/>\nI walked away from the table to let the players brainstorm while I handled con related needs at nerdnyc's Recess. When I came back they fully embraced the NPCs. Another interesting data point is that they ignored half the NPCs and became very invested in a select few. 2 of which were featured in the opening scene.<br/>\n<br/>\nChristopher: an angry 14 year old from a poor family who was a former cult member and was saved by one of the Dogs. Christopher summoned the Dogs with a letter writing, "it's happening again" (referring to demonic cults).<br/>\n<br/>\nDuty: the new Steward's adopted daughter who is from a neighboring mountain person town. 1 of the Dogs had an intimate relationship with her and another was having trouble hiding his secret feelings for her (the same Dog who saved Chirstopher above). Additionally, most of the Dogs had deep relationships to both of Duty's adopted parents. Gerber, the father, who was responsible for the town's initial pride and injustice.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the first scene the Dogs witness Christopher mounting a smaller person (Duty) and repeatedly punching her in the face. Her head is covered with a bag with a crewed image of the king of life drawn as a mountain person on it. The Dogs intercede and Christopher screams that she's a demon, the reason why he asked them to come, and not to look at her face as to be swayed by her innocent appearance.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Dogs argued about what to do, some eager to deal with the demons and the others highly suspicious of the validity and justification of the situation. Not to go into too many details but once it was revealed that the person was Duty the Dogs were torn apart. And it didn't help matters that Christopher began preaching that 2 of the Dogs must be demons for siding with Duty. And after a few other interactions with Gerber and Annie (Duty's adopted parents from the linked write up above) it exploded into bloodshed with 90% of the town unrevealed but it didn't matter. They had all the situation they needed for a 3 hour game with just Duty and Christopher.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was especially memorable for me as many of my Dogs games end with moderate violence and lots of forgiveness. Although I usually play with 2-3 players. 4 seems to help explode the inter party conflict.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo demons were revealed. No intentions explained. Very few justifications given. But we saw what happened when a specific group of zealous teenagers with a great deal of moral superiority, very little life experience, rampant sexual urges, broken pasts, torn allegiances and guns did to each other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212222/#Comment_212222" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-14T12:07:26+00:00" title="June 14, 2009 12:07PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That breakdown sounds very powerful and intense.
