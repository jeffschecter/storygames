I started watching it with very low expectations (it was just on TV over here), but it was great fun! The plot will sound extremely lame if I try to write it down, so I won't; but it was very, very much like watching a story game unfold - with the players (not the characters) a part of the game.<br/><br/>I recommend checking it out. It's fun, and has some cool ideas about games &amp; stories.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94278/#Comment_94278" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-09T21:54:05+00:00" title="September  9, 2007  9:54PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Slick!

The main gimmick is that there will be a game within the game - the mechanics will be represented in the fiction so that the characters recognize it as a game.  In the intro scene, setup, they all described their issue + part of the setting. Then each framed a scene...<br/><br/>...but then the Sister player had to bail out. The two others decided the character went into cryogenic freeze.<br/><br/>...later, the Sister player came back, but it was clear that the Sister plot (meeting boyfriend) was kind of lame, and didn't have anything to do with the current plot anyway. The player made a new character, Astronaut, much more suited to the setting.<br/><br/>Players gained points by reintegrating/re-using these elements that other players had set up earlier:<br/><br/>- Kid brother likes hiding in the dumb waiter (which he later does again, furthering the plot)<br/>- Kid brother knows a way through the basement (which he later uses again)<br/>- The Zorgons want energy (which is why they return when Sister wakes up + turns on lights)<br/>- The robot is fixing itself (which means it returns later in the game)<br/><br/>During the game, the players each had Issue scenes, where the following Issues were resolved:<br/>- Older brother: Hating younger brother for being born<br/>- Younger brother: Incompetent at everything<br/>- Sister: Wants to meet boyfriend (which was handled with Sister as an NPC, and her falling in love with Astronaut)<br/>- Astronaut: Wants to undo a badly made decision (narrated through actions of Older brother)<br/><br/>In the Endgame, they all took turns narrating first the Disaster At The End Of The Game (everyone falling into a black hole), then the Harmony As Reality Takes Over (the house is OK, dad comes home, the brothers throw ball + are friends, they're all going to mom's house). The beginning player got to narrate the Final Detail (the bike falling out of the sky).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
