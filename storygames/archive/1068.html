                    I'm in the process of deciding how to finally present City of Birds. (I have a post on the Forge, <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=20779.0" rel="nofollow">here</a> about the different publishing options.) So I'm also working on revised <a href="http://primevalpress.com/games/birds" rel="nofollow">website</a> text that will, hopefully draw people in.<br/><br/>The thing is, I don't want to spell things out very much. City of Bird's purpose is questioning underlying ideas behind RPing (and larger issues). But I want people to think about those ideas, and discover what the game's really about, by reading or playing; not from me preachifying. It's like a good painting: the painter doesn't want to explain to you what his piece is about, necessarily; he wants you to look at it, and if he's succeeded you'll find a meaning of your own.<br/><br/>Thus, the problem. I need a website that is enticing but sitll, in some ways, vague. Should I only focus on the more obvious aspects of the game, and not even mention the game's deeper purpose? Or should I hint at it without saying exactly what it is? Here's what I have right now:
<blockquote>WHO YOU PLAY<br/><br/>In City of Birds you play a citizen of an ancient empire's capitol city. The City can be anywhere: China, Sumer, South America, Babylon. What matters instead is your character's life and the lives of those around him.<br/><br/>Your character is deeply enmeshed in his society and bound to the other protagonists. He has a history and a path. When his life in interrupted, he will have to react, and he will have to change.<br/><br/>THE CONCEPT<br/><br/>All the role-playing we do is shaped by underlying ideas we hold about much larger issues. Often, we're not aware that there's any other way to think.<br/><br/>City of Birds is an experiment. It has been created from atypical foundations with rules that match. Hopefully it will create a different kind of gaming experienceâ€”perhaps it evoke the sort of ideas that went into it.<br/><br/>What are these ideas I've been alluding to? I think it's best if you find out by reading and then playing. I will, however give you some more clues. The following are some key rules in City of BIrds.<br/><br/>Rules<br/><br/>    * Characters are defined by their connections and roles in society.<br/>    * Players trade off various GM-like duties, from creating scenes to controlling a protagonist to deciding what happens.<br/>    * No numbers and no dice (or other randomizers).</blockquote> </div>

                            I like it as it stands, but I would like to see more color. Like some examples from play with excellent description, something to catch my eye as I read. Just at first read, I don't have a clue as to the ideas you've hidden in the play, if that is your intent. Also, your 3 rules are awesome.                        </div>

                            Thanks, Jason. You're right, more color would be good. Are you thinking a couple of examples or something longer and more in depth?<br/><br/>As for not having a clue...yeah, I guess that's intended. Or at least it's intended that I not give it all away directly (show don't tell). Is it at all irritating to be given hints but nothing substantial?                        </div>

                            Things I would find helpful would be:<br/><br/>An example character, better yet a few of them showing the range of possible stories.<br/><br/>An example setting, if that concept applies.<br/><br/>An idea of what the mechanics do do, I know they don't have dice but not much more.<br/><br/>And above all else, an example of what is expected to happen in play.  In DnD the core narrative is going into the dungeon.  There's tons of other stuff you can do, but the core play example is that.  It lets one know what kind of game it is.<br/><br/>What does one do in your game?<br/><br/>I note that there may be reasons not to answer these, but bear in mind once I've played once I have the answers anyway so if it bears repeat play you can probably give a bit away.                        </div>

                            Jasper, to me, your blurb comes off like you're an arrogant blowhard who thinks he's beyond hot shit.  If I saw this and had not heard and followed City of Birds, I'd be completely turned off.  At root, I'm not interested in anybody's "experiments" unless I know them well and have talked with them in-depth to know that their experimental interests are at least marginally parallel to mine.  Without knowing you from Adam, an "experiment" sounds reckless, ill-thought-out, and probably really unenjoyable to play.  I would strongly suggest you don't try to market CoB as an "experiment."<br/><br/>Instead, focus on what makes your game unique, the kind of play (not purpose of play) that it can provide, and why it would be <em>fun to play</em>.  Especially the fun to play part.  Everything else is icing on the cake; a game stands or falls on whether it provides an enjoyable experience.  Your ad copy needs to make a strong case that your game does just that.                        </div>

                            Here's a rewrite. I'm still thinking about a longer example of play or example scenario. 
<blockquote><h3>Who You Play</h3>
In <em>City of Birds</em> you play a citizen of an ancient empire's capitol city. The City can be anywhere: China, Sumer, South America, Babylon. Your character is deeply enmeshed in his society and bound to the other protagonists. He has a history and a path. When his life in interrupted, he will have to react, and he will have to change.<br/><br/>Your group might play...<br/><br/>* The sons and daughters of a successful merchant. Each wishes to help the family business, but also find a job and spouse for himself.<br/>* Members of the royal court, vying for power as the queen ages.<br/>* Residents of a small neighborhood. Over time, some families prosper while others decline. Regardless, together they celebrate festivals, elect representatives, and resist local thugs.<br/><br/>The Rules<br/>In <em>City of Birds</em>, characters are defined by their roles in society and connections to other people. They  are  all connected to a central non-player character, the Focus. Through these traits they will make decisions, confront conflict, and bring trouble upon themselves.<br/><br/>Players trade off various GM-like duties. In each "round" of play, everyone gets a job: The Voice describes a scene and creates a conflict, while the Bird's character confronts it. Together, the Snake and the Tiger decide on its outcome: the Snake handles short term results, while the Tiger balances these with long term repercussions.<br/><br/>There are no numbers and no dice—human ingenuity provides plenty of unpredictability. Piles of stones help regulate the flow of play while coins are dispersed as reward for good play and can be spent to change a character.<br/><br/><em>City of Birds</em> is extremely low-prep. A satisfying game can be played in a few hours; it can be run as a one-shot or for multiple sessions.</blockquote>

                            Jasper, that reads far more appealing to me.  Now I nitpick.<br/><br/>Reverse the "You might play" list and the "In City of Birds..." paragraph.  Ditch the "You might play" header and prepend each line with "You are..."<br/><br/>Ditch the sentence about the Focus.  That's getting too specific for this purpose.<br/><br/>Ditch the scare-quotes around "round".  If it's a round, it's a round.  If it's called something else, they'll learn that when they read the book.<br/><br/>Depending on the end use of this copy, you might ditch the Voice/Bird/Snake/Tiger lines, or significantly shorten them.  (The Voice describes a scene where the Bird is confronted with conflict; the Snake and Tiger decide the outcome.)<br/><br/>Ditch "can be spent to change a character".  No numbers and no dice!  Use stones and coins!  That's it, next paragraph!<br/><br/>I'm thinking you probably need to either unpack "extremely low prep" or slap a time on it (You can start playing City of Birds in ten minutes).  The One Shot / Multiple Sessions thing is probably needless; that's characteristic of most games and is not unique to CoB.                        </div>
