Younger than some of my friends.<br/><br/>I thought about a number of games but I had a hard time finding something appropriate to play.<br/>Fantasy and sci-fi would not be appreciated. <br/>Anything romantic or overly dramatic would make me uncomfortable. <br/>Fiasco is a close choice but I find the outcomes too cruel to play it with my parents.<br/><br/>From one recent thread I discovered Last Train Out Of Warsaw, and this is the first game I have seen that I would feel comfortable playing with them, and I think they would appreciate it too.<br/><br/>I think that something with an historical setting and a degree of action and character relationship emphasized over the mechanics could be a good fit, but I am just guessing.<br/><br/>Can you guys give me more ideas? Consider that it would be their first gaming experience!<br/><br/>--i.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343114/#Comment_343114" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-17T17:33:15+00:00" title="September 17, 2011  5:33PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No experience with it, but if the hard endings are the only problem with Fiasco there are softer tilt and aftermath tables is the Companion, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nOtherwise, I've got no clue.

Personally, I would hype up the western themes to keep the focus off the religion, especially if they're big western fans. I'm not the best person to answer this question I think though.<br/>\nOther than learning the rules, I think you just need to do town creation(it includes creation of major npcs) before the first session, and I'm pretty sure the book walks you through it pretty in depth. At the first session, before you start the main game, there's chracter creation and each character's initiation scene(which I'm sure I'm calling by the wrong name), then you play.<br/>\nIt's not bad on the prep at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343119/#Comment_343119" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-17T18:35:31+00:00" title="September 17, 2011  6:35PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran D&amp;D for my family back in the early 80s when they were in their 40s.

The best part is that they're really supportive of my gaming because of it. My dad ran my first adventure for me and a couple friends years ago, and played a support character in a game I ran for some family friends' kids. But yeah, it's been very neat hearing the occasional story.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yeah, I didn't know about A Taste For Murder, but a murder mystery is pretty much perfect. It doesn't stray into unfamiliar territory(especially with so many crime shows on TV) and ordinary people, non-roleplayers and such, still do those murder-mystery parties, so it's obviously accessible. If you can grab the extra players for it, I'd do that(I'll add that Dogs might need one more player as well, I don't know how it works with 2. Vincent mentions in the book that it should work, but I'm not positive myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yeah, it's pretty much up to you I think to keep out of bad territory.

I don't know if they'd be your parents' (or your) thing, but they might be good to experiment with because they're so short, and they're not fantastical. People like your folks (never played a game before) were who I wrote 'em for. They are politically charged, though (Enola Gay less so)!<br/><br/><a href="http://littleplasticpeople.wordpress.com/2011/09/09/enola-gay/" rel="nofollow">Enola Gay</a><br/><br/><a href="http://littleplasticpeople.wordpress.com/2011/09/11/11/" rel="nofollow">11</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343251/#Comment_343251" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-19T09:23:29+00:00" title="September 19, 2011  9:23AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/hans">@hans</a> I already saw them about a week ago and I also put them in "the big GM-less list" from another thread :-)<br/><br/>I might go for something a bit lighter on drama, but I am fascinated by your short-form games. <br/>I think they would also make great gaming to be played for an audience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343252/#Comment_343252" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-19T09:30:20+00:00" title="September 19, 2011  9:30AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ivan</cite><a href="/forums/profile/hans">@hans</a> I already saw them about a week ago and I also put them in "the big GM-less list" from another thread :-)<br/></blockquote>\nOk.
