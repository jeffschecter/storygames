Also perhaps too hokey a setting for my current players, and possibly me too. Too intriguing to chuck.<br/><b>Chill</b> - Donated to me by a friend. Sorry, Q - I'll probably never play it.<br/><b>Iron Heroes</b> - I love all the tactical options. It's probably an awesome play. I'll never be able to find gamers who want to do "3rd edition D&amp;D but more complex and less familiar to us," even if I run Dark Sun with it.<br/><b>Core Command</b> - I was basically just disappointed.<br/><br/>You?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246294/#Comment_246294" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-11T22:18:20+00:00" title="December 11, 2009 10:18PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Shatterzone</b> -- I own this for nostalgia's sake.  There are plenty of broken rules in here... frex, it's easier to hit people when they're farther away.  Why?  Because, ostensibly, they can't move out of your way as much.  I'd argue, they don't have to, because if you move the tip of your gun by just a tenth of an inch, then the distance is going to amplify your mistake, making this an idiotic argument.  But I like the cards (same as TORG, I believe) and some other stuff.<br/><br/><b>Iron Heroes</b> -- While I love the tactical options in theory, they're full of fail.  By that, I mean the whiff factor is really high.  My favorite classes get just a token here and there, then they have to use that token before their roll to try and have an added (mostly minimal) effect, and then the to-hit roll is likely to miss.  Cool character concepts, horrible rules execution.  Maybe mostly because of the D20 baggage.<br/><br/><b>Robotech</b> -- Also a nostalgic thing for me.  I've got the whole series, all core books plus expansions.  Love the mecha, hate the rules.<br/><br/><b>KULT</b> -- I used to run this for years.  I still love the setting, but there's no good guidance on what the hell to do with it.  Nor do the rules support it (martial arts masters in a Hellraiser setting? Wha?).<br/><br/><b>HeroQuest</b> -- A vastly generic rule system, but then there are a million listings for all kinds of different things?  I'm just not feeling it.  The system sure has its good parts, but there's just something lacking for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_246296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20L" title="Dave L"><img alt="Dave L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20L">Dave L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246296/#Comment_246296" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-11T22:28:53+00:00" title="December 11, 2009 10:28PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Star Wars Saga - If I were to play SW again, I'd either use the Solar System or the old d6 version.<br/>\n<br/>\nD&amp;D; 3E.

I set the probability of that every happening as quite low.<br/><br/><b>CthuluTech</b> - marvelous central conceit, married to rules that are clunky and uninteresting and do little to advance that. I have a someday vision of using Reign to support large scale factional feuding and importing Unnamed Armies derived sanity mechanics from Nemesis. Perhaps something to return to when <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/arcdream/reign-enchiridion" rel="nofollow">Reign Enchiridion</a> is out, but lets face it, I don't have the kind of time to invest into such a wholesale rewrite.<br/><br/><b>Swordbearer</b> - obscure early fantasy RPG with some intriguing subsystems (the node based magic system, and the social class based equipment/encumbrance system) but with its fair share of clunk as well. I'd play it, but again, I'm unlikely to find a group willing to engage with a quirky, crufty rule system over time just for the sake of the answering the question "what would engaging with these rules be like?"<br/><br/><b>Dragon Warriors</b> - Britain's answer to Red Box D&amp;D, and broadly similar (but with its own unique fillips). Recently revived as a line by Mongoose. Most distinctive in terms of tone, which is more authentically medieval/fairy tale than D&amp;D's pulp picaresque.  Likely to remain a source of inspiration, rather than actual play.<br/><br/><b>Miles Christi</b> - a fabulously evocative, out of print, French language RPG about the historical crusades, with a distinctly magical realist bent.

My first introduction to games that had totally consistent internal mechanics from combat to shouting matches. Haven't played it in 15 years or so, though. Too crunchy to go back, I think. But if I wanted to do an "Elric vs the Shmoes" game with combaty-combat, I'd probably go for this system.<br/><br/>Continuum<br/>Bought it, read it, loved it, found it unplayable, sold it. Later, bought it again to read, read it, found it unplayable again, sold it again. Bought it a *third time* because I realized that I was never gonna play the thing, period... and yet it has the coolest - THE COOLEST - setting and background. The timeline of the world section, the little fictions, all are really slick. <br/>I even played Continuum (the setting) with Primetime Adventures. That was the thing that made the game "pop".<br/><br/>Planescape (AD&amp;D 2nd Edition)<br/>Just haven't gone back to 2e after 3e came out, not interested anymore. Love the setting and feel of the outer planes. Love the Factions, although Sigil as a city of adventure can pretty much go hang. Planes of Chaos boxed set was killer. Played the hell out of it for a year, but never went back once 3e came out.<br/><br/>Sengoku<br/>Great sourcebook. System is as bland as cooked oatmeal. Also, there's no real direction: A sumo wrestler, a geisha, a rice farmer and a samurai team up and do... what?<br/><br/>Everway<br/>A beautiful boxed set, but as was said elsewhere, it doesn't come packed with a Jonathan Tweet to run it for me.<br/>Player: "I swing my sword at him!"<br/>GM: (shuffle, draw) "Law!"<br/>Everyone: ". . ."<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246483/#Comment_246483" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-13T19:27:04+00:00" title="December 13, 2009  7:27PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Everway is one of my go-to games for one-shots.

But if the GM chose instead to base the decision on karma, players could give up narration rights in order to gain a card. Because reading cards to determine the consequences of a conflict is fun. Trust me. <br/><br/>So, for example, if the consequence card is "Law" to the action "I swing my sword," the implication is that the blow is true, unless the defender has been noted to be particularly well-armored. But of course, "I swing my sword" is task resolution, not conflict resolution, so no wonder the game falls flat.<br/><br/>An alternate hack is to let each side in the conflict declare an intention and a related action and then draw a card for that intention/action, and use the juxtaposition of declared intentions and actions, simultaneously revealed cards, and overall context to determine the outcome of the conflict. GM: "They skulk at the edges of the wood, seeming to grow bolder as the sun gets lower in the sky," and then Player: "I charge at them headlong in order to frighten them away." The GM draws "Drowning in Armor" (Protective Measures Turn Dangerous) and the player draws "Law." This seems to me to mean that the hero's ploy scatters the skulkers as the shadowy woods conceals his position and makes his attacks more nerve-wracking. <br/><br/>It takes practice, but it's fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_246502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246502/#Comment_246502" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-14T00:06:22+00:00" title="December 14, 2009 12:06AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let's take the Everway stuff to a <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11102" rel="nofollow">new thread</a>.

I still love much of the setting of these games, but to tell these stories I would use a game like Sorcerer.<br/><br/>Kult / Chill / Witchcraft<br/>I got these to help me better understand running horror style games.  Kult has a setting and world which I love, but I'd use another system to tell these stories as well.<br/><br/>AD&amp;D 1E &amp; 2E / OD&amp;D<br/>I never made the move to 3E or 4E, and now that I have discoverd Fudge and Fate never will<br/><br/>Cyberpunk / Heaver Gear / Bubblegum Crisis / Action! / Fuzion<br/>This is still my favorite rule heavy system. I have nearly everything for Cyberpunk from the original box set to 2030 revision. It's the second RPG I ever played, and the first one I GMed. I currently want to run a power-armored anime game along the lines of NeonGeneses or BubbleGum Crisis, but I want a system with a better social and relationship mechanic, so I can bring out those aspects. I'm still looking for the system I will use.<br/><br/>Dust Devil / The Pool / Troll Babe<br/>These games are too narrative for me. I found I did not like just handing over of narrative control to the winner or loser of a conflict, to give a monologue. But I did find that adding a fact type system worked well, so something like Houses of the Blooded is in the right balance for this style of games. <br/><br/>Burning Wheel Revised<br/>It just a little heavy and the multiple conflicts system are a little convoluted. Now the I have Mouse Guard which I think nearly perfected the Burning wheel system, I see no reason to play the original.<br/><br/>ZoZ / T&amp;J / PDQ<br/>I found that Risus just played smother then PDQ.  I have some interest in PDQ# I like the style stuff, but it's unlikely I will move away from Risus for our quick hit games.<br/><br/><b>Some Games I hope to play soon</b><br/>DitV / IaWA<br/>I love both these games.

Smells fainty like it's been in a fire. I read it out of curiosity, but nothing about it excites me whatsoever. Certainly no fit compensation for the Playstation 2 he stole. :P<br/><br/><b>Champions (3rd or 4th Edition)</b> I got this after long years of frustration with Palladium, just in time to see my high school game group graduate and disintegrate. Customizble point-build is cool and all, but there's no way I have the patience to connect every hose and adjust every gasket under the hood of a Champions character. If I really have an itch like this I'll go the "lite" route and use BESM.<br/><br/><b>Intergalactic Cooking Challenge</b> Got it as a gift from its designer, Zach Welhouse, and much as the concept and text make me laugh out loud 'til my nose bleeds. . .the rules (sorry, Zach!) just don't excite me. It looks like you just sort of, roll some dice, when like, stuff happens? On the other hand, the premise is so gonzo and funny that I'm holding on to it, and I probably WOULD like to play it using <i>some</i> ruleset...<br/><br/><b>Advanced Dungeons and Dragons, 1st Edition</b> Found the Player's Handbook and DMG at Goodwill for 2 bucks each and couldn't NOT get it. I've browsed it idly, and I'm interested in it as a historical artifact, but never actually considered <i>playing</i> it. If I wanted to try some Old-Skool D&amp;D I'd probably go Red Box.<br/><br/><b>Everway</b> Yes I know EVERYONE already like scoped me here. But anyway I tracked this down on Ebay after playing Over the Edge and D&amp;D 3rd, and hearing all this talk about "Seminal game design brilliant avant-garde origin of Drama Fortune Karma ETC." It's very...pretty, and the concept of interpretive resolution intrigues me, but the hippie-trippy Nexus of All Worlds new-age setting sparks my imagination not at all. Maybe I should have hunted down Ars Magica instead.<br/><br/><b>Lord of the Rings RPG by Palladium</b> I was all excited about running a Middle Earth campaign that actually felt like Middle Earth and this sucker looked like it had a lot going for it. The text on roleplaying with Tolkienian values was pretty good, the races seemed pointed in the right direction, and most of all--the Weariness-based magic system was spot-on. But then I discovered Indie Games and yer basic Skills'n'Feats, Roll-Dice+mod vs Target Number tasky ruleset wouldn't cut it for this kind of thing. Plus it was horribly broken. Nowdays if I ever run a Middle Earth game I'll use Heroquest.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11092/games-you-own-but-will-probably-never-play" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11092/games-you-own-but-will-probably-never-play" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11092/games-you-own-but-will-probably-never-play/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F11092%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F11092%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
