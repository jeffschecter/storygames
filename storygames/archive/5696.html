It keeps bringing me back, in a sort of roundabout way, to my opinion that RPGs are Imaginative Play of a sort largely or completely denied to adults, or even children older than, say, ten years of age.<br/><br/>One interesting section of the book discusses a child psychologist who, in the wake of the Trade Center attacks, experienced a high incidence of violent play among the children she works with. Rather than being concerned about this, we should encourage it, the book opines - these violent fantasy games and such are a method by which children attempt to make sense of senseless violence and killing in the world. They also serve to release stored-up tension, anxiety and aggression, and without such a release valve these children might be <i>more</i> prone to serious violence, etc.<br/><br/>I don't doubt that our play (mine, yours, and everyone here) has at one time or another been of use to us in this way. (Bad day at the office? Beat on some Nazis, kill some Orcs!) But I wonder, with focussed design like we work with now, if the therapeutic applications of our play won't become more apparent? Where do you see gaming at in ten years, with regards to personal development, therapy, and imaginative play? In what ways does gaming serve the aforementioned needs in your game life?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127379/#Comment_127379" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-18T19:05:11+00:00" title="February 18, 2008  7:05PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Therapeutic play is a very, very, very, very well-known and documented field.

They understood the roleplaying side of things easily and the dramatic editing side as well. However they were very reluctant to get involved in any violence. My girls are big for their age, head and shoulders above most of their classmates and they have had 'thou shalt not smack anyone' drummed into them. Even when they got it into their heads that they were allowed to enact violence on the nasty goblins, they still tended towards the clever, non-violent solutions. They quite liked bopping people on the nose and Emma (the younger one) carried an axe with great glee, but never actually used it! The games as played created a strict sense of right and wrong in them and brought out quite a number of issues for the girls which we talked about afterwards. It was very illuminating. The APs are here:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a href="http://neilgow.blogspot.com/search/label/Faerys%20Tale" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://neilgow.blogspot.com/search/label/Faerys Tale</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThey've now been absorbed by their Nintendo DS' and I'm seeing some similar patterns emerging. They don't play against each other, they work together. Lara (the elder) is better at some tasks than Emma. They swap their handsets so that they can overcome different parts together. They got a Submarine in some Sonic the Hedgehog variant last night and the joint celebrations were tantamount to my WoW guilds whooping and hollering when we downed Ragnaros for the first time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt vexes me that some people can bemoan these styles of play as inappropriate when they are really speaking from an ill-informed point of view. Play keeps me sane in an increasingly insane world and gives vent to a creative streak that is still running strong in me. I see no reason why children cannot enjoy this as well. I can feel myself revving up for a long and quite snarly 'hoodies without sports fields' rant so I'll stop to save the boards karma..<br/>\n<br/>\nPlay is good.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127468/#Comment_127468" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T03:46:29+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  3:46AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Pooka</cite>And, yes, I know about therapeutic play.

However, the more interesting parts of the book, at least for me, were where he discusses that violence in games is needed as a teaching tool, allowing children a safe venue for exploration of what it means to grow up in the real world, for themes like honor, duty, courage, sacrifice, those kind of things. The book makes a good case that violent play is neccessary for healthy development, not just escape or relief (which are also much needed things, of course).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127598/#Comment_127598" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T09:22:22+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  9:22AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My mother still brags about how my brother and I stopped fighting as often as we used to when we started playing D&amp;D (we were like 12 and 13 years old back then).

Put in more rationalistic terms, psychology remains dead neutral on issues of "what we ought to do" or "what we ought to be," letting the patient supply those on their own. And, as such, its our myths that fill this role of putting meaning in our lives. If those are lacking, I think that psychology doesn't help much. <br>\n<br>\nI think that RPGs already do serve a role as a way to have a discourse on mythic matters of meaning. But I also think that in the future they'll serve a somewhat important role in getting to a place where meaning is more part a meaningful part of certain parts of public discourse. To put it fliply, when everyone in the world is playing World of Warcraft one day, the world is going to disintigrate fast if there isn't some method for inserting more meaning than basic survival and power. <br/>\n<br/>\nTTRPGs development could be seen as the way to which we give individials a framework for personally empowered thematic statement. Sure, a director of a movie has that power now, but that's a small percentage of people. RPGs could be the seed of the democritization of spiritual expression. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust a thought. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pooka" title="Pooka"><img alt="Pooka" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y136/pooka_fn0rd/appleb-1.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pooka">Pooka</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127784/#Comment_127784" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T15:12:01+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  3:12PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>TTRPGs development could be seen as the way to which we give individials a framework for personally empowered thematic statement.

Very much the sort of informed and interesting speculation I was looking for.<br/><br/>I didn't phrase my thinking well in the OP, so I appreciate that there's still discussion going on here. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
