For these purposes if you just used it as a general ideas springboard that does not count, actual play means you actually used that game product in a game that you played or ran.  Yes, I realise lots of folk count general inspiration as actual play, but for the purposes of this thread I don't.<br/><br/>If you can say why you haven't played the stuff you haven't played, that would be cool too.<br/><br/>I'll go first, and for these purposes I am only going to talk about my story game purchases.  Expanding to all rpg purchases would make baby Balbinus cry...<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purchases</span><br/>Sorceror<br/>Sorceror &amp; Sword<br/>Sorceror's Soul<br/>Charnel Gods<br/>Schism<br/>Trollbabe<br/>octaNe<br/>The Pool<br/>Ghost Light<br/>My Life with Master<br/>Dogs in the Vineyard<br/>PTA<br/>Burning Wheel<br/>Heroquest (not sure it is a storygame, but people often seem to count it)<br/><br/>of which I've actually played octaNe, the Pool, My Life with Master, Heroquest and Dogs in the Vineyard.  I have also used Sorceror &amp; Sword as a direct reference in another game, in that I actually referred to it as part of planning that game, but didn't use the actual rules.  The ones I haven't played I haven't played for a variety of reasons, some because I think I bought them in a froth of excitement only to find that the game really didn't do that much for me, some because I thought I needed them to understand what was happening in the indie scene (a reason I now view as flawed incidentally), PTA I just haven't had opportunity but really want to play, Burning Wheel I haven't worked out how to play yet.<br/><br/>So, what games have you bought/acquired/downloaded?  What have you actually played?<br/><br/>For the curious, the reason for the question is that I think that we may be experiencing a replacement supplement treadmill, where instead of buying supplements we never use and reading them we buy games we never use and read them.  The indie equivalent of giving up smoking and gaining weight instead.  I also have some thoughts on rpg supply/demand mismatch which are broader than storygaming but will post on those separately.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66057">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick" title="Troy_Costisick"><img alt="Troy_Costisick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thumbs.webs.com/s/viewProfilePic/?siteId=67823825&amp;memberId=67823877&amp;size=small&amp;530737"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick">Troy_Costisick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66057/#Comment_66057" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-30T02:30:24+00:00" title="April 30, 2007  2:30AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heya,\n<blockquote>For the curious, the reason for the question is that I think that we may be experiencing a replacement supplement treadmill, where instead of buying supplements we never use and reading them we buy games we never use and read them...

The we there is a purchasing we, we as people purchasing rpgs not we as in people designing rpgs.  I'm not pointing fingers at designers here at all, I do think purchase without play is common (among storygamers possibly a bit less than in the general rpg community, though I'm not sure if it is still less than the general) but I don't think the reasons for that have much to do with the actual designers.  <br/><br/>The fault lies not in our stars but in ourselves.<br/><br/>My interest is in the choices we as consumers make, and to a degree how that impacts the hobby, I'm not talking here about choices designers have made.  I'm talking about the trend in the rpg community to purchase games one doesn't actually play, which I think is widespread.  I'm not, to be absolutely clear, building up to some nobody plays these games beartrap.  I don't think that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig" title="Malcolm Craig"><img alt="Malcolm Craig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/contestedground/UntitledAlbum/photo?authkey=UQZ1oivg8Lc#5239981636020065186"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig">Malcolm Craig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66064/#Comment_66064" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-30T03:03:50+00:00" title="April 30, 2007  3:03AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2007 3:11AM by Malcolm Craig.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, so what have I picked up over the past couple of years then.

Contenders created a great game, yet I wasn't initial (prior to play) convinced that it would be. That being said, outside of it, I ran many games for those who were new to the hobbby, so a lot of the ones mentioend above provided an easy in.<br/><br/>So, I'm unsure about trends, certainly within the groups I play with. In my regular group, we've played Dogs, The Roach, Contenders, Shock and Cold City together. Some of these were successful, others were not. All of them were chosen on a consensual basis, generally with one person being a particular proponent of the game in question. My own purchasing habits were based on the interest I felt in the game concept and whether or not I felt I would play the game at some point (the notable exceptions being Etherscope, which I bought purely to read, and Drowning &amp; Falling, which made me fall over laughing).<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malcolm                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66080">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66080/#Comment_66080" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-30T04:40:57+00:00" title="April 30, 2007  4:40AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2007 8:11AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I own four games I've never played - Cutthroat, Universalis, The World of Synnibar and Heirarchy.

It's just impossible, I don't keep track of that sort of thing.<br/><br/>I can talk about some rough figures I've pulled out of the air regarding my purchasing over that period though.<br/><br/>I bought a bunch of games.  Quite a few.  Counting only Story Games, probably a metric bunch or two, give or take.<br/><br/>For example, I've bought he following over the last year or so and haven't even begun to read them.  they're in this pile which I'll get to, eventually.  Right now I'm reading the Strontium Dog casefiles vol1 though:\n<ul><li>Mountain Witch<br/></li><li>Dead Of Night<br/></li><li>Hero's banner<br/></li><li>Dead Inside</li></ul>\nI've also bought the following over the last year and read them, but not played them per-se:\n<ul><li>Unsung - Seemed OK, didn't make me ultra hyped to run it though.<br/></li><li>Legends Of Alyria - Great game, not sure I can pitch it to my players.<br/></li><li>Thirty - Stole the Fraternitas mechanic for Savage Worlds.<br/></li><li>Capes - Impenetrable.  I've read the book but have no idea how the game works.<br/></li><li>Shock: - ditto.<br/></li><li>Dictionary of Mu - Kinda read it, but the fact that I've never really got on with Sorcerer hamstrung me a bit.<br/></li><li>Cold City - Seems pretty neat.  Haven't got to it yet.<br/></li><li>Burning Empires - Looks fantastic, but I think perhaps a bit too longform and complex for my players.  I did nick the Beliefs and Instincts for Savage Worlds though.<br/></li><li>Shab Al-hiri Roach - Was supposed to play this the other day, but someone was ill and we played Masons instead.<br/></li><li>Spirit of the Century - Neat game, but I already have Savage Worlds which my players know.<br/></li><li>Covenant - I had a few issues with the resolution mechanic which mean it's not near the top of the pile.<br/></li><li>Best Friends - Not got to it yet.  Looks pretty neat.<br/></li><li>Drowning and falling - Hmm, not entirely sure that's supposed to be played per se...<br/></li><li>The Shadow Of Yesterday - Got to the bit where there was an example of play which contradicted the text immediately preceding it, put the book down to wait for the next revision.<br/></li><li>Conspiracy of shadows - I read this and think it's fantastic.  There's a lot of meat that I've been chewing and I've probably spent a lot longer with this game than some of the ones I've actually run.</li></ul>\nI've bought the following over the last year and read them and run them at least once:\n<ul><li>Don't rest your head<br/></li><li>PtA<br/></li><li>Contenders<br/></li><li>Mortal Coil<br/></li><li>Agon<br/></li><li>Mechaton (if that counts?)</li></ul>\nThere are probably more in every category, but my memory's not what it used to be.<br/><br/>Things to note are:\n<ul><li>I have time for about 1 session per week, plus the odd con game.<br/></li><li>I spent most of 2006 running Savage Worlds and having a whale of a time with that.<br/></li><li>One of my regular players pretty much refuses to have anything to do with any game which has player narration.  Thus, involving him in any storygame is like pulling teeth.  He's the archetypal reactive player who waits for the GM to hook his character and then does what he's told.  He is no longer in my regular games because what he wanted vs what I wanted were incompatible.  Lovely bloke though.<br/></li><li>I've spent most of the sessions in 2007 playtesting Uml\xc3\xa4ut.<br/></li><li>I've really enjoyed reading the vast majority of the games I've read.  The ones I haven't played is (unless otherwise stated) because I haven't had time, not because I haven't had the desire to play them.<br/></li><li>In terms of value for money I find most story game books to be pretty reasonable in terms of cash spent vs time they keep me amused.  Even the ones I don't run I tend to read and then think about and talk about.<br/></li><li>Consider also that I have about 2 dozen DVDs which are unopened and unwatched, plus probably a dozen videogames either unpoened or played for less than an hour.  Waiting for me to get to them.</li></ul>\nI don't really know what kind of point you're trying to make (if any).

It's easy to find one, harder to find multiple groups.<br/><br/>This means that there's less chance that the group is going to be willing to play something "non-standard." Most groups I've been in will standardize on something (usually D&amp;D) and it's hard to break out of that.<br/><br/>The second is related; some games require specific types of people to play. I mean a mindset here; you need people who look for particular kinds of things in their gaming. If a group is interested in primarily the "fun, kicking ass and chewing bubblegum, soda-and-pretzels" style of game play, that's not wrong -- but it just means that the other types of games won't be played.<br/><br/>If even one person is like that -- if one person will be miserable playing something else -- it skews the willingness of the group to try something new and different. We all can agree to play a generic fantasy game; why make one unhappy when we run off to play something else?<br/><br/>The third is that I'm kind of cowardly. I don't like taking direct risks like "hey, let's play SOMETHING WEIRD which may not WORK but we'll give it a shot!" because I am afraid that will reflect poorly on me. I could propose it and get shot down, in which case I feel stupid, or I could propose it and we play it and it's not enjoyable, in which case I feel stupid.<br/><br/>It's work enough running games (and I'm usually the Designated Gamemaster, and it's my choice) that I would rather have it be an enjoyable experience rather than one where I end up feeling stupid, so I try to do my experimental stuff less blatantly (by co-opting various genre conventions, for example). I feel it's "risky" enough putting my GMly creative works out there, that I don't want to push further.<br/><br/>Fourth, a lot of games I honestly get just to read. I've spent far more time reading game books than I've spent playing roleplaying games, or preparing for roleplaying games -- and I've done a heck of a lot of RPGing. I don't buy roleplaying game materials necessarily thinking I'll run the games, but rather that I'll enjoy reading them.<br/><br/>Finally and fifth, a lot of what I read does end up being used indirectly in roleplaying games I run (or create), but not as originally intended. It becomes part of the background body of knowledge that I bring to gaming as a gamemaster, player, or game creator, and it helps to make me better at those roles.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fifth_child" title="fifth_child"><img alt="fifth_child" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://forum.rpg.net/image.php?u=8366&amp;dateline=1157831572"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fifth_child">fifth_child</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66164/#Comment_66164" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-30T10:17:29+00:00" title="April 30, 2007 10:17AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2007 10:48AM by fifth_child.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Balbinus, I already answered your mirror thread over at RPGnet and included both traditional and indie games.

It's because the gaming background I and my fellow gamers are from -- the long form campaign.  We play the game as a television series with seasons, but those seasons aren't the five game sessions and we're through them.  They could last for a dozen episodes, and those episodes could cover multiple gaming sessions.  (Sometimes this is the fault of the game system, slowing down the gameplay in mechanic fiddling.  Other times it's because we're having so much fun with an episode, it fills out more than one session.) <br/><br/>Consider that my group gathers fortnightly and suddenly a game we're playing can last a year.  While I'm playing my long game, those crazy game designers keep coming out with new, interesting games that I'd like to play.  Backlog results.  Meanwhile, I've got a set of d6 Star Wars books sitting on my shelf because I'd really like to get back to that game and I've got stuff like Burning Empires over here that wants me to play it.  I wouldn't mind if my game group were something like the Durham 3 or the Storn/Jeff/Judd group from SoK, saying we'll be playing Game X for the next three sessions, then a session of Game Y, and then five sessions of Game Z.  But at the same time I like some elements of the long form campaign.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66170/#Comment_66170" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-30T10:28:56+00:00" title="April 30, 2007 10:28AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2007 10:30AM by buzz.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Every single indie/story RPG that I have played has been at a con, or as a one-shot playtest for a con.

However, Sorcerer being the core book, that means I still used it in the two S&amp;S games that I've run.  Polaris I've only ever played two sessions of, and I'd really love to play it again sometime.  Conspiracy of Shadows I just wasn't inspired by - I think I prefer my conspiracy games to be modern rather than historical/fantasy.  Just a preference thing.  Shock I found slightly disappointing.  The idea is really, really awesome, but when it comes down to it I'd rather play Universalis, because the rules are more clearly explained.  Hero's Banner I think is a case of "haven't played <b>yet</b>," because I'd jump at the chance to play a game of it, but other games (Agon, Spirit of the Century) have kind of pushed it onto a back burner.  Similarly with Lacuna - I haven't played it <b>yet</b>, but I'd like to.  The last four on the list are all very recent purchases.  I wouldn't mind playing any of them, but Dictionary of Mu is definitely the one I'm most jazzed about.<br/><br/>The games I've played the most are Dogs in the Vineyard, Burning Wheel, and Universalis.  More than 12 sessions of each.<br/><br/>The games that I've only played 1 or 2 sessions of: Polaris, The Mountain Witch, With Great Power, Spirit of the Century,  and Agon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson" title="C.W.Richeson"><img alt="C.W.Richeson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/55624463/10865474"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson">C.W.Richeson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66173/#Comment_66173" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-30T10:48:33+00:00" title="April 30, 2007 10:48AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Balbinus</cite>CW, if you play such a small portion of what you buy, why do you buy it all out of interest?

Dan Davenport nailed it when he said that as you become a comped reviewer your actual purchases dwindle away because they eat into time dedicated to reviewing.  Not too helpful a contribution to the thread, I know <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>On a more helpful note: Before I became obsessive about reviewing my influx of games was about the same.  My standard deal was to skim it, read fun sections out of order, and then go from there.  This was especially common for D&amp;D and WoD supplements, which are often very easy to assimilate and cherry pick.  For out and out actual games it used to be the case that I read them leisurely for fun without the expectation of every really playing them.

Some of the games are obvious one-shots like MLWM, KPFS or MW, but I'd like to really get an Indie campaign going using Mortal Coil or PTA.

I may decide to play Qin one day, but I mainly picked it up to get a feel for what's going on in the French design scene. I think Weapons of the Gods fits my tastes better than Qin, but I suppose I'll have to play it to say for certain.<br/><br/>Pendragon will get played if I get a hankering to do something with Arthurian myth. Though it's been a while since I've been excited by Malory, Chretien de Troyes, et al. Probably some day.<br/><br/>Starchildren and Castle Falkenstein will get played whenever I work up enough initiative to slot them into our schedule.<br/><br/>I purchase relatively few games these days as I'm mainly interested in playing the games I have. A game has to have something special going for it to get me excited enough to buy it these days. And I'll only buy things that I have every intention of playing.<br/><br/>That said, I think there's a fair number of games that I own that I've played once and don't have any particular interest in playing again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66202/#Comment_66202" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-30T12:47:22+00:00" title="April 30, 2007 12:47PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hm.<br/><br/>Bought n' Played:<br/>Shock: Social Science Fiction (several times, with several groups. The book is impossible to decipher at points, but that's when you just make up what you think is the right answer. Due to interpretation, its homebrewed. :P)<br/>Don't Rest Your Head (yes. Actually, technically I traded a copy of Perfect for this, but I count it as played. I've played several times, with several groups.)<br/>Polaris (con game, before I actually bought the book.)<br/>My Life With Master <br/>Perfect (Yes, I'm going to count this as bought, even though it's my own game. I've played it at multiple cons and game days.)<br/>The Shadow of Yesterday (played: Aztec godkilling adventure, dark fantasy/horror game (gmed), dungeoncrawl (gmed), and a failed attempt at a classic fantasy orc hunt scenario.)<br/><br/>Bought n' Read:<br/>Best Friends (because it was a short read)<br/><br/>Bought n' Started to Read:<br/>Cold City<br/>Covert Generation<br/>Burning Wheel<br/>The Mountain Witch<br/>Agon pdf<br/><br/>Got for free and haven't touched:<br/>Mutants and Masterminds<br/>White Wolf pdf bundle.

I simply didn't have time to crunch through the books, and I'm a fairly slow reader I guess.<br/><br/>As you see, most everything I've finished reading I've played. It's just all the unread stuff that sits in a pile in the corner.<br/><br/>My group consists of a lot of people that buy fairly frequently, or have in the past.<br/>Games I've played that they've bought:<br/>Sorcerer (several sessions)<br/>Capes (character creation)<br/>Dogs in the Vineyard<br/><br/>I've also been doing playtesting, and so has Kirk and so has Steve Danic. We've playtested Polarpunk, Thirteen Virtues and Kin in that time as well. So, that's a few less slots available for published and purchased games.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I feel a bit disapointed that I've bought so many games. I think I need to focus on what I've already got and learn how to really get the most out of those games. Between playing the games we've already played, playing the games on our shelves, and playtesting our own games... our group is going to be tapped out for a very long time.<br/><br/>I need to quit the consumer urge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66232/#Comment_66232" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-30T15:01:48+00:00" title="April 30, 2007  3:01PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2007 3:11PM by eruditus.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My measure of when I would start listing was based on when Luke introduced me to Burning Wheel.

Please note that I'm only counting back two years (to about GenCon 2005) cause that's all I can really account for. I'm including ALL my RPGs here, not just the thematic-focused ones.<br/><br/>Also, please note that I have a habit of buying games, reading them, picking the ideas I want out of them, and then reselling them on RPGNet or eBay. I'm pretty much including the ones I purchased (book or PDF), as I seriously can't remember all the ones I moved on, save Weapons of the Gods, octaNe and all of the Exalted 1.0 Fatsplats.<br/><br/>Bought and played all of the following in the last two years:<br/>Star Wars 2E Revised and Expanded (had it,played it,  lost, it, bought it again, played it again)<br/>Savage Worlds<br/>With Great Power<br/>Universalis Revised<br/>Primetime Adventures Revised<br/>The Shadow of Yesterday revised<br/>Shab al-Hiri Roach<br/>Breaking the Ice<br/>The Mountain Witch<br/>Gurps 4th Edition (sadly only once, which totally doesn't outweigh the price or pain yet. I'm determined to do 2 more games of it this year)<br/>Blue Rose + Expansion<br/>Feng Shui (had 2nd edition, played it, sold it, bought 1st edition, played it)<br/>Unknown Armies 2e (later sold... unfortunately now I kinda think I might run it again)<br/>Spirit of the Century<br/>Iron Heroes (only played 2 sessions: I will feel unsatisfied until I get about 2-3 more sessions in)<br/>Polaris<br/>octaNe<br/>AGON: Just finished a campaign<br/><br/>Haven't Played Yet, with explanations:<br/><br/>Exalted 2.0 : I played the first Exalted a lot, and wanted to see what 2E was like.  I will be selling this book shortly.<br/>Qin: The Warring States : Too much data prevents coming up with a quick campaign and running it.  Though it's on my "must play" list. Too much "data" for my tastes, which normally is ok, but with this game I plan to run, say, a four session game, and that's a lot of investment in rules for a short game.<br/>Untitled : Still trying to grok the underlying game. I bought it because it's an awesome collection piece, too, not necessarily to play, though I would like to at some time.<br/>Dictionary of Mu : Haven't gotten around to it yet. Bought it mainly for the juicy read, though. It paid off.<br/>Seven Leagues : Bought it, plan on running it in the next year using Japanese monsters for a nice simple 1-2 shot.<br/>Conspiracy of Shadows Revised : Admittedly, Keith ran a game for us but I don't count that. I bought it for the Eastern Euro Goodness<br/>Legends of Alyria : This game is on deck with my bi-weekly group. It will be played within the next 6 weeks.<br/>Mortal Coil : Haven't been inspired by it yet, save the mechanics<br/>Contenders : Haven't gotten a chance yet. But with half the folks in the area die-hard fans, it will probably happen in the next few months.<br/>Nine Worlds Revised : Wasn't interested in the Greek backdrop. Just recently I had the inspiration that it is the absolute perfect game to run an "Exalted Sidereals" game (without even needing to add a single house rule), which I will by the end of the year.<br/>Panty Explosion : Got it because I'm a sucker for anything Japan-themed. Not planning on playing it at this time.<br/>Legend of the Five RIngs 1st edition : Had it and almost all of its supplements, sold it, bought 2e, sold it, read 3e, went back and bought 1E again. It's a go-to game, but haven't played it yet, not even when I originally bought it back in 98.<br/>Mob Justice : Was very interested in the subject matter. Haven't been inspired too much to learn it enough to play it yet, though<br/>Artesia : Pretty Book!  Ohhhh, Pretty Book!  I bought it because it is the most beautiful RPG layout and design, ever. That is all. I will not play it, but have no plans to sell it.<br/>Classroom Deathmatch: Bought it for a friend in Japan so that he could write an article about it for a Japanese gaming mag.<br/>Bones : Great concept, and I was meaning to play this when I bought it. Unfortunately, I wasn't too floored by it when I got my copy.<br/>Orkworld: Given to me by a friend. Interesting read. Probably won't play it, and move it on. It just didn't catch me.<br/>Beast Hunters: Just came out. This, too, is on my Must Play list<br/>HardNova II: Purchased PDF to test viability with my weekly gaming group. It didn't fit.<br/>EABA Lite: Purchased PDF to test viability with my weekly gaming group. It didn't fit.<br/>Daisho: Samurai Adventure 1pg: "Ohhh, another Japan-themed game." I actually mean to make it a go-to game, but it's so inobtrusive that I keep forgetting its on my hard drive.<br/>Burning Empires: For now, it's too much work for the payoff. I've got it on hold for "will play if someone in my area runs it". Oh, and again, "pretty pretty book!" It sits next to Artesia.<br/>Truth &amp; Justice : Honestly, I bought this because I wanted to support Chad's gaming company (because I love Dead Inside, and am looking forward to 7Skies), and simply had no interest in the subject matter of Zorcerer of Zo. So instead of buying that one, I bought This one instead, figuring I'll play it sometime.  Not sure if I will.<br/>Bacchanal : I am not man enough for this game.<br/>Esoterrorists : Planning on running it as a one shot soon, in 1-2 months, with one of my local groups.<br/>Weapons of the Gods : By a twist of cruel fate, both my copies are now in the hands of some fucker in Cali who only bought one, and refuses to send mine extra back!  If I did have it, it would go on the "play within a year" stack: No rush to play it now, but no intention of leaving it on the shelf.<br/>OVA : PDF. Plan on playing it, possibly this weekend at Nerdly.<br/>Hearts and Souls: This is the other supers game that really excites me, but won't have a chance to read it enough to run it for at least 6 months.<br/><br/>Hmmm, looks like my "played" ratio is over 1/2, closer to 2/3. Edit: The numbers would probably also be interesting if I divided apart my "purchased and planned to play, but haven't yet", "purchased and planned to play, but later decided not to", and "purchased with no intention of playing". I thought it would be less than that. I might be forgetting some PDFs purchased between 2005-2007, though. Hmmm.<br/><br/>I also like Jensknot's comments, so I'll list mine, in order:<br/><br/><b>I'll buy something for any of the following reasons:</b><br/><br/>- heard about it, inspired to run a campaign of it soon<br/>- my friends are playing it or want to<br/>- gorgeous yet pragmatic layout and design (Artesia)<br/>- covers a topic I enjoy (fiction or non-fiction: See "Asia" or "India" in my case)<br/>- originality<br/>- innovative rules<br/>- know the author<br/>- like author's previous work<br/>- GMless but doesn't suck<br/>- people reference it a lot online<br/><br/>After that, I'll play it if it does the following:<br/><br/>- teaches the rules well<br/>- can be learned quckly<br/>- continues to inspire after purchasing it<br/>- someone else picked it up and will run it<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/talysman" title="talysman"><img alt="talysman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/talysman">talysman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66256/#Comment_66256" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-30T20:23:31+00:00" title="April 30, 2007  8:23PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2007 8:25PM by talysman.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I'm going to group games bought/received over the last five years by play status and reason for play status, because it makes it easier to understand what is going on.

IH really could use a bigger handbook of monsters, however...<br/><i>Burning Empires</i> - own the pdf &amp; book; haven't played it yet, since my gaming group voted on BW, instead; i hope to get to play in the future, however! the manoeuver mechanics suggest all sorts of interesting things for mystery games...<br/><i>Blue Planet</i> - bought this during FFG's big sale, last year; i don't actually intend on playing it, since it has a traditional but crazy system, but i expect to mine the setting material for a science-fiction game i'm working on...<br/><i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i> - (free) - haven't played it, and i'd want to get a set of FUDGE dice before i'd run it, but it is definately a good source of ideas;<br/><i>FATE 2ed</i> - (free) - i'm interested in the Dresden Files FATE 3ed game, so i snatched the FATE rules to get a better sense of how the game would work - i don't really intend on playing it (plus, FUDGE dice)<br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">By the Stars</span> - (no book) i've participated in two of the playtest sessions of this game in development - which is significant for my meager play record! <br/><br/>In general, i'm very cautious about buying games i don't think i'm going to play, and i don't have much of a budget to boot. That said, i'll probably be adding a couple of games to this list over the summer.<br/><br/>(Also, the new d20 Star Wars system is looking a bit tempting...)<br/><br/>Edit: Forgot one!

I couldn't figure out what it did that BW didn't do for me.<br/><br/>2) FVLMINATA:  I was at Gen Con and was excited to see this game in print again.  It is on the list to read.<br/><br/>3) Truth and Justice:  Man, I wish this was prettier; super-hero games need to be pretty.  Still, I might whip this out for some friends.<br/><br/>4) Artesia:  Sent to me as a gift (thanks, John!) and admittedly, I haven't read it yet.  But I dig the graphic novel and will give it a hard look.<br/><br/>5) <b>Trollbabe</b>:  My girlfriend and I sat down and made up a character for her and she was excited to play it at some point.  Chargen's nifty.<br/><br/>6) <b>Donjon</b>: Played a session that didn't go well with Alexander and Dro and Mayuran at Dreamation or maybe a Dexcon.<br/><br/>7) <b>No Press Anthology</b>:  I've played a few games out of this, two with Michael  Miller and Rob B. at a Jersey Con.  Fun and lots of bang for your gaming buck.<br/><br/>8) Mob Justice:  Why the fuck haven't I played this?  Shit, this one just fell through the cracks.<br/><br/>9) Nine Worlds:  Man, I don't know what to do with this game.  I'm just not sure.  Alexander had a neat idea of doing a Norse version.  I'd love to wrap my head around the mechanics and the only way I see to do that is to play it.<br/><br/>It is on my to-play list, with a bullet.<br/><br/>10) <b>My Life with Master</b>:  I played this at a con some years ago and that session is burned into my skull.  And I've felt no urge to play the game again.  It was harrowing, fun, amazing design but ultimately a harrowing night.<br/><br/>I blame Michael.<br/><br/>11) Charnel Gods:  A friend of mine gave me his copy of the hard copy book after I had bought the .pdf.  It is an amazing setting that inspired me to push Mu farther.  I'm sure I'll play it.<br/><br/>12) <b>Capes</b>:  Bret showed me this game in less than optimal conditions.  I'd like to give it a go again.<br/><br/>13) <b>Conspiracy of Shadows</b>:  We played a really fun pirate campaign with this one.  Vicious and awesome stuff.<br/><br/>14) Inspectres:  I watched some friends play this at Gen Con in a sesion that I missed because I had to take a nap and freshen up.  Damn my nap.  Another one on my to-play list.<br/><br/>15) <b>Mountain Witch</b>: Played a stellar all-night session of this at Dreamation and ran a solid game at GYGO-a-thon.  Yum.<br/><br/>16) Breaking the Ice:  How is it that I haven't played the romantic comedy RPG?  I suck.  Allow me to put this on the to-play list too.<br/><br/>17) <b>The Shadow of Yesterday</b>:  This game rocks so hard that it inspired me to write my own game based on it.  Clinton's setting of Near is amazing and the mechanics back it right the hell up.  I played a fun game of this with Aaron and Bret one Friday night where we created the streets of Verwhenen.<br/><br/>18) The Roach:  As someone who works in a university library, this game draws me in.  Another for the to-play list.<br/><br/>19) <b>Shock:</b>:  I've played some really fun and DARK games of this with Joshua and Rob.  The next time we play this game there will be spacemen with fins on their helmet and starswords and starships with Cadillac fins.  Oddly, I haven't read it yet, having played it with the creator twice.<br/><br/>20) <b>Arcana Evolved</b>:  Rob ran this, maybe seven years ago and I liked my character.  Monte does d20 like nobody else.<br/><br/>21) Orbit:  Sent to me as a very kind gift and it just didn't grab me.<br/><br/>22) <b>Nobilis</b>:  Played a lukewarm session of this at a con and loved reading the book, even read some pieces of text out loud to my girlfriend but damned if I know what to do to make a game go.<br/><br/>23) <b>D&amp;D 3.0 and Company</b>:  I was running a game of this just before the first Lord of the Rings game came out, a game about two halflings finding a dragon egg, hiding it from the evil Imperial Rome-type nation and raising the dragon to rule their forest nation.  Fun times but I found running the game tough, like swimming against the stream.<br/><br/>24) <b>Carry</b>:  I've played two games of this with Nathan and its always really interesting.  <br/><br/>25) <b>Mortal Coil</b>:  I was really excited about this game when I got back from Gen Con last year but some parts of the conflict res make me itch a bit.<br/><br/>26) Schauermarchen: There's some scary text in here but I'm not sure if there is a scary game in here.<br/><br/>27) Hero's Banner:  After Storn's Burning Wheel game this past winter, I've felt that my noble being torn by different passions itch has been scratched but the generational aspect of this interests me.<br/><br/>28) <b>Contender</b>:  I think this game will work really well for my Monday night buddies.  To-play and I know just where to do so.<br/><br/>29) Dead of Night:  This might be the game to scratch my current zombie-movie itch.  The book's so damned cute, cute like a werewolf pup.  I like holding it.<br/><br/>30) <b>Primetime Adventures</b>:  Hell, yes.<br/><br/>31) It was a Mutual Decision:  I might know just the couple to get together with to play this.  I'm eager to do so.  Sock this one on the To-Play List.<br/><br/>32) <b>Sorcerer and Family</b>:  I adore this game.  Folks keep saying things about Mu being for a different system and bless them for buying my book but they are heretics (Fred, I'm looking at you).<br/><br/>33) <b>Burning Empires</b>:  We playtested it and it was interesting; I'm eager to give it a go with the finished book.  If I don't get into a Galactica-inspired epic space battle, I will consider the campaign a failure.<br/><br/>34) <b>Burning Wheel</b>:  Man, I dig this game.  Its crunchy.  It is fucking subtle.  It is a stunning piece of work.<br/><br/>35) Everway:  This was a gift (thanks, John!) from a friend when I was toying with a tarot-based RPG.  I haven't cracked it yet.<br/><br/>36) <b>Riddle of Steel</b>:  Neat game that inspired me to write Riddle of Blood and play a rockin' mini-campaign of heavy metal vampires.<br/><br/>37) <b>Godlike</b>:  I ran a cool one-shot of this and it was some bloody shit.  The ORE is nifty.<br/><br/>38) <b>Unknown Armies and Company</b>:  Played a three month or so campaign of this sucker and I think its a nifty game.  I've run it a few times.  The mechanics make percentile dice fun.<br/><br/>39) <b>Spirit of the Century</b>:  We had a few month or two of gaming with this and Aspects fascinate me.  The text could be stronger and I'm worried it relies on techniques I've learned from other games to make it go but damn, its a neat game.<br/><br/>40) <b>With Great Power</b>:  My first game with Michael was a playtest of WGP during a draft that he was really unhappy with.  I have been reading the text of this game between novels and short stories, hoping to give it a go at some point.<br/><br/>41) <b>Cold City</b>: We played a fun mini-campaign of this in 2006 and other than some hiccuping due to running an investigative game for the first time in a long while which led to a kind of flat first session, the campaign ended up on a strong note.<br/><br/>42) <b>Lacuna...</b>: This was among our summer one-shots and this one had legs.  We should've played more.  It is a game that doesn't feel like it should work but it does and it works really well.  The Second Attempt has taken it from an interesting idea to a great game.<br/><br/>43) <b>Polaris</b>:  Played a wonderful session of this with Ben, Rob and Jeff at a Jersey Con and then played a lackluster game of it with Bret, Bob and Jeff, mostly because I think Bob and Jeff just weren't bought in.<br/><br/>EDIT:  I keep running across games that just weren't on my shelf when I wrote this post.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Actual purchases, actual play - Page 2 - Story

that were purchased in the last two years (many others were bought and sold again, including many indie/story games).  Games in <b>Bold</b> have been played:<br/><b><br/>Artesia</b> (played using OTE rules)<br/>Game of Thrones D20<br/>Midnight Setting D20<br/>Eberron<br/>Exalted 2E<br/>Lord of the Rings<br/>Tekumel (played previous versions, but not tri-stat)<br/>L5R 1st Ed and Rokugan Book<br/><b>Breaking the Ice</b> (played at Gencon with Julie and Emily)<br/>Roanoke<br/>Castle Falkenstein<br/>Ravenloft 3rd Ed D20<br/>Pendragon 5th ED<br/><br/>Games on my shelf purchased before 2005 (again, uncountable games have been purchased and sold, sometimes multiple times.  These are the ones that I kept or repurchased):<br/><b><br/>Talislanta 1st Ed</b><br/><b>GURPS Fantasy II Madlands </b>(played once using OTE rules)<br/><b>Empire of the Petal Throne </b>(my first RPG in 1976, played until 1978)<br/>Witchfire Trilogy D20<br/><b>Everway </b>(2 copies, played as is and used system for other settings)<br/>Lace and Steel<br/><b>Flashing Blades</b><br/><b>Al Qadim setting </b>(played once using OTE rules)<br/>Fulminata (1st and 2nd Ed copies)<br/><b>Warhammer FRP 1st Ed</b> (2 campaigns)<br/>Usagi Yojimbo (Fuzion Ed)<br/>Runequest Vikings<br/><b>Prince Valiant </b>(played once)<br/><b>Maelstrom Storytelling </b>(played once using OTE rules)<br/>Theatrix<br/><b>Over the Edge </b>(played once in Al Amarja, used rules for many settings)<br/><b>Underworld </b>(played once)<br/>Metabarons<br/><b>Fading Suns </b>(played once using Everway rules)<br/><b>Skyrealms of Jorune 2nd Ed</b> (played as is and using OTE rules, both long campaigns)<br/><b>Tribe 8 </b>(three campaigns using D6, OTE, and Everway rules)<br/><b>Call of Cthulhu </b>(played as is multiple times)<br/>Wushu<br/><b>Pokethulhu </b>(played once at Gencon)<br/>Sengoku<br/><br/>There are other miscellaneous supplements and books on the shelves (Cowtown Creator, Airmen\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Gazetteer for Crimson Skies, etc.), but these are the main settings and systems.  As is apparent, I see setting and system as two separate entities, and usually do not use the rules that come with a game to run campaigns in that setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rumble" title="rumble"><img alt="rumble" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.plaguegames.com/DONlone.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rumble">rumble</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68119/#Comment_68119" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T16:33:51+00:00" title="May  9, 2007  4:33PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I've only played four story games: <br/>\n- Dead of Night (of course), as GM only, never a player (fun, of course)<br/>\n- Donjon, as GM only, never a player (fun, but chaotic experience)<br/>\n- OtherKind, as GM only, never a player (poor experience)<br/>\n- octaNe, with me as a player only (fun experience)<br/>\n<br/>\nI created DoN. <br/>\nI paid for octaNe (and the expansions, which I never used.)<br/>\nI paid for Donjon. <br/>\nI downloaded OtherKind for free. <br/>\n<br/>\nI probably own 30-40 storygame titles, especially if you're counting stuff like Orkworld, Orks! and HeroQuest. <br/>\nI probably own 300-400 RPG titles overall, and my overall play:purchase ratio is probably roughly 10%. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was younger, I had a lot of time, and not much money. The only thing I had to do was go to class and pass tests. Consequently, I played virtually everything I bought. Then I got rid of it if it wasn't the best system evar. I kick myself now for unloading some of those older titles for the nostalgia and the cost, but bygones are bygones. <br/>\n<br/>\nNowadays, I have more money than time. For quite a while, I bought to support my hobby, because pieces of a game interested me. I wanted the ideas, and to reward others for having come up with them. However, I've always had a very, very low tolerance for complex rulesets, needless jargon, and meandering explanations. I never wanted to read pages of description. RPGs writers aren't novelists - their prose should simply inspire me. I don't want to run YOUR great game. I want to run MY great game. <br/>\n<br/>\nI want a tight presentation of essentials with elaboration available for when I deem it necessary. Very, very few publications meet my standards (even DoN has room for improvement. :) ) And the majority of ideas I skim past these days seem rehashed, dull, convoluted, or some combination thereof. And quite frankly, I'm tired of buying ideas. These days I strive to buy actual experience. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have a wife and child, a job with a strong potential for advancement. I don't think I've bought an RPG in the last six months. Runepunk is on my list, as is anything for Battlestations, but that's it. NOTHING else looks good to me. Instead, some of my money has gone into board games (another 250-300 titles there), but even that's slowing down. I like having my disposable income around to treat my kid. Plus, gasoline is getting annoyingly expensive.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe coolest "RPG" I picked up recently was a full set of the Tangled Tales electronic pick-a-path game. I have the Starter Set, both (of the nearly impossible-to-find) base adventure expansions, as well as the Nancy Drew and Edgar and Ellen modules. My kid can already push the buttons and say all the words. Now it's just a matter of actually learning to read the cards. :) A few more years, and we can bring the baby to the actual RPG table to join the other folks to actually play instead of just converse with them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68122/#Comment_68122" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T16:45:08+00:00" title="May  9, 2007  4:45PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played every game I've ever bought.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/2912/actual-purchases-actual-play" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/2912/actual-purchases-actual-play" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/2912/actual-purchases-actual-play/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F2912%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F2912%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
