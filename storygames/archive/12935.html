I've also been for ages kicking around an idea of how to do a card based system, inspired by Dragonlance SAGA, and even moreso a system that could be handled just in a deck, so no need to cart around a rulebook or anything else.<br/><br/>So here's where it's at so far.<br/><br/>40 classes and 40 races, although I'd be calling them crafts and archetypes. Archetype because it's hard to think of 40 suitable actual races, so I was going for ideas like the virgin, which isn't really a race, and craft because it's easy to do 3 levels; apprentice, journeyman and master.<br/><br/>So some example archetypes: dwarf, troll, virgin, faun, gypsy, vampire, werewolf, zombie, ghoul, brownie, pixie, nymph, centaur, etc.<br/><br/>Some example crafts: witch, magician, pirate, thief, paladin, soldier, hunter, shaman, assassin, archer, minstrel.<br/><br/>There would be a total of 160 cards - 40 archetype cards, 40 craft cards, 40 apprentice cards, 40 journeyman cards and 40 master cards. Each card would have certain fixed qualities - stats, to cover any generic action, and would have 2-3 special abilities. There would be overlap in the abilities, for instance gypsies, fauns and minstrels would all get musical ability, although the gypsy would play the violin, the faun the pipes and the minstrel the lute. The gypsy and witch would also overlap on curses, and the faun, thief and brownie on sleight of hand. The werewolf and vampire would both get shapeshifting, but it would be for the wolf and bat form respectively, and the witch and magician might be able to force others to change shape. Some would also be unique, like the virgin gets a unicorn mount.<br/><br/>Actions would be carried out using a form of trump, the archetype and class cards in use would stay with the players, but the rest of them are shuffled into the deck and used in a hand to perform actions. An ogre might have a strength 8 and a dexterity of 2 (using those abilities right now for the sake of convenience, elemental stats like fire, air, earth, void, water might also be interesting), and if he's drawing a brownie card the stats might be reversed, while a troll card would be much the same. The ogre would be better off saving the troll card for a feat of strength and the brownie card for a feat of agility. Some of the cards, particularly craft cards might have scores of 0 - no reason for a master minstrel to be any stronger than anyone else of that archetype, so they wouldn't contribute at all for a feat of strength, but a card has to be used to perform an action, so the ogre might use the master minstrel card for a rather easy feat of strength as his inherrent ability does the trick.<br/><br/>Depending on the situation, a special ability could be used that would normally only be available to the archetype or craft. To cast a spell to return a demon back to its home dimension, a thief might run to grab the spellbook of his fallen magician companion, run through the pages to find the right spell and give it his best shot. Since he has a magic card in his hand (say that of a journeyman witch), he can use that card to one time, because the situation is right, take the chance to do something he'll likely never do again.<br/><br/>Obvious issue I see is that 160 cards is a really thick deck, but for now I rather like the idea of 40x40 rather than 20x20 which would otherwise make the idea of just carrying the whole game in a deck and not needing anything else - paper, pencil or any randomiser - to play.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_291460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291460/#Comment_291460" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-03T14:27:12+00:00" title="September  3, 2010  2:27PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: migo</cite>There would be a total of 160 cards - 40 archetype cards, 40 craft cards, 40 apprentice cards, 40 journeyman cards and 40 master cards.</blockquote>\nI don't mean to be a downer or anything, but that's 200 cards.<br/><br/>If you did 20 of each, you'd have a deck about the size of two regular playing card decks, and I think anything larger than that would be too much of a pain to use.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_291462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291462/#Comment_291462" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-03T14:30:56+00:00" title="September  3, 2010  2:30PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Most card printers are 18-up, so you might want to scale your ambitions to those numeric dimensions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_291465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291465/#Comment_291465" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-03T14:57:02+00:00" title="September  3, 2010  2:57PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, I was all set to jump into an old -school deconstruction of RPG's as being about nothing but race and class privilege.
