So far, I've got 20 or so. Here are some examples:\n<ul>\n<li>A group of conspirators, at the cusp of great action, with doubters who must be persuaded or coerced.</li>\n<li>A fleeing woman, whose brother has been fed to jackals.</li>\n<li>A pirate queen, worshiped by her crew of jungle savages.</li>\n<li>The inhabitants of a lost city, degenerate and fallen from the glory of their past.<br/></li></ul>\nTwo hundred or more entries is a lot of work, especially if I'm consulting the stories for images. <br/>I invite you to help. Post contributions here and I will compile, edit, and distribute the new oracle when it's done.<br/>If you want to participate, you'll need:<br/><br/>1) Familiarity with In a Wicked Age. (<a href="http://www.lumpley.com/wicked.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lumpley.com/wicked.html</a>)<br/><br/>2) Access to some or all of the Conan stories authored by Robert Howard.<br/><br/>Please do post entries derived from the stories that Howard himself wrote. I ask that you don't post entries from any other source. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conan_the_Barbarian#Original_Robert_E._Howard_Conan_stories" rel="nofollow">Click here for a list of Howard's Conan stories.</a> )<br/><br/>My method has been to flip through my story collection, pick a passage at random, and convert it to an oracle entry. Of course, when I get a memory flash, I use those too.<br/><br/><i>Between the years when the oceans drank Atlantis and the gleaming cities, and the rise of the sons of Aryas, there was a Wicked Age undreamed of....</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127269/#Comment_127269" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-18T08:24:39+00:00" title="February 18, 2008  8:24AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 21, 2008 4:13PM by Valvorik.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Added:<br/><br/>There are major spoilers for Conan stories sprinkled through these elements so if you haven't read them and ever want to enjoy doing so "from clean start", best to avoid this thread!</b><br/><br/>With 208 entries needed, need more per story of course since there are 17 original stories, 4 published after his death, 4 fragments (according to wikipedia).

Not only fun stories but their style suits a "play now" kind of action theme - they feel like the kind of story a IAWA or Universalis can create.  They're quite different from the Tolkien+ era fantasy.<br/><br/>The only thing to take care of, and in the oracle too, would be that they are products of a time and place and their attitudes of race etc. are not always quite right.

For example when I wrote "A pirate queen, worshiped by her crew of jungle savages" I had already filed off the 1920s trope of the white woman worshipped as a god by black savages. My thought was that not only did this remove a bias of the era, it produced a more more flexible image for repeated game play. <br/><br/>After collection, I'll analyse and look for themes and try to balance composition. If necessary I'll fill in holes with existing Oracle entries. I've also been looking at Sorcerer and Sword's list of demon types and I want to be sure to identify the pagan things, old ones, and uncanny beasts. <br/><br/>One reason I like Howard's original stories is because the supernatural usually had a physical face -- if it can affect you, you can attack it back. Magic was mostly necromancy, summoning, pulp-style hypnotism, and herbalistic healing. The stories focus usually on conflict between humans. I want to produce an Oracle that has few or no demonic influences.<br/><br/>EDIT: I also think I would package this Oracle with a short intro on Howardesque magic and monsters, as well as the Ron's S&amp;S and Trollbabe technique of starting with a sketchy map and choosing locations on it for each chapter. The world would get filled in over time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127769/#Comment_127769" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T14:29:00+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  2:29PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you have the opportunity to grab the new(ish) Dark Horse Conan comics, you might well find it easier to grab evocative images from them then by pouring through the actual books.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think there are some 50+ issues out now...would be rather easy to find at least 4 panels of note in each...and the comics are about as close to the Howard originals as a change in medium allows.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127827/#Comment_127827" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T17:48:06+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  5:48PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alan</cite>Hey Rob,<br><br>My thought was to collect as many raw entries as I could and then do some editorial work to file off any gender or racial bias.

from vagabond to king in the stories, e.g., getting to one point and saying "I've done everything but rule a civilized land" like the quote above about "never been king" (which he of course then does, and better and more fairly than civilized men).  I'm not sure if early on he's got his eye set on kingship, though the author is moving him along that road.  I think for him it's always set on riches and "more" and in true adventurer fashion, there's just a point when that's the next thing, I think.  He's ambitious but not in a "I will scheme for 20 years to get a throne" kind of way.<br/><br/>Alan, don't know if you've thought of dividing into 4 oracles and on what basis but "Freeswords in Search of Adventure" (for the stories like Red Nails and Beyond the Black River) might be one for a freebooter feel and another might aim for the complications of rule, kingship etc.  <br/><br/>Thanks for starting this, my game of IAWA was actually in a quasi Conan era (the struggle was defending the Aquilonian border).<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127935">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DainXB" title="DainXB"><img alt="DainXB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DainXB">DainXB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127935/#Comment_127935" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T06:57:39+00:00" title="February 20, 2008  6:57AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Possible titles for a four-oracle structure:<br/><br/>'Freeswords and Adventure' -- (What Rob said, but setting aside 'seeking' or 'in search of' since, sometimes, in the Hyborian Age, adventure comes to <i>you</i> <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>)<br/>'Thunder and Blood'  -- (The Conan equivalent of 'God-Kings of War', with battlefields and raids and so on.

For one thing, I think the basic IAWA structure works fine and doesn't need tinkering on this point.<br/><br/>- I don't think you want people looking at an element and automatically thinking "it should be like it was in the story that came from", "this character should be like Conan, this character like Belit".  <br/><br/>- To avoid pressure to recreate specific stories, I would suggest actually preferring to put elements in different oracles if they are recognizably same story and can be split up that way.<br/><br/>-  Many elements can work in any oracle (e.g., "a cursed necklace that blinds wearer to risks" can figure in any theme).  I suggest taking all the elements, picking those heavily thematic and organizing them, looking at others and seeing where they fit but also then mixing and matching a bit.  Also, looking at them all and organizing them other themes might come up.  You might even see some patterns in Howard's writing interesting just from literary critical perspective.<br/><br/>- Some thought perhaps required on "Why do you want to play "Conan oracle"?  You want to play stories with a sensibility and events like unto the Conan stories?  Use that framework as a broad basis of consent for framework of creativity in game?  E.G., no elves etc., monsters often "monsterized" animals (carnvirous gray apes, giant snakes, resurrected or reanimated dinosaurs, giant spiders - btw, been meaning to get around to adding in some elements of these combined with character-suggesting elements like the "giant spider waiting as prey draws near" one), magic usually evil/tainted/questionable (not always), gray issue sometimes if magic is really magic or just super-science mistaken for it, fantastic evolution/devolution results, occassional cthulhoid freakiness.  Whatever, organized oracles to support this.<br/><br/>- I don't imagine people actually playing "conan" very often as that over-ranks one player etc.  In the one IAWA game I've played, one player was pretty much playing a mighty-thewed barbarian with an inner compass of "What would Conan do" - which was fine.  He ended up captured via treachery and later killing the ruler who betrayed him (in a 2nd Chapter) ~ without trying it did turn out a very 'conanesque' story for him, but he was Balashi not Conan and the story was no more his than the other two players'.  I think if the other two had been playing the same style though, story would have been less interesting (their best interests etc. were more subtle, indirect etc. which made for a nice mix).  If it was the story's of Balashi's betrayal and revenge, it was the story also of Damrina's military triumph and the possible start of her great career, and the story of Hadir's continued ignomy and humiliation which shall surely all be put right someday and indeed started turning around in Chapter 2.  Game has gone hiatus (as so many skype etc. seem to) but they were all heading back into confrontation in Chapter 3 and there was no sense that the "conanesque" character was morely likely to come out on top than the civilized military officer or the ambitious devil-tainted sorcerous, though in a Conan story we all know who comes out ahead.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129771/#Comment_129771" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-23T12:24:39+00:00" title="February 23, 2008 12:24PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valvorik</cite>I don't think you want people looking at an element and automatically thinking "it should be like it was in the story that came from", "this character should be like Conan, this character like Belit".</blockquote>Good point, and one I hadn't considered since I hadn't read them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129830/#Comment_129830" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-23T16:10:50+00:00" title="February 23, 2008  4:10PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2008 4:50PM by Valvorik.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Black Colossus<br/><br/>o A thief among thieves entering ruins in which a sorcerer sleeps away the millennia.<br/>o A cult worshipping a power legend says never died but only sleeps in its tomb.<br/>o The desert army of  sorcerer whose features are always masked.<br/>o A coin showing a three-thousand year old visage which is also that of a new leader recently arisen to power.<br/>o A king\u2019s sister, struggling to rule while her brother languishes in a rival\u2019s dungeon.<br/>o An ancient lascivious evil, weakened by lust, whispering nightly to its next victim.<br/>o An oracle commanding a princess to take extraordinary measures to preserve her realm.<br/>o Three nobles cast down by their Queen in favour of a captain of mercenary spearmen.<br/>o A night when vampires are abroad, witches ride naked on the wind, and werewolves howl across the wilderness as a lone figure comes riding a black steed to a shrine of evil. <br/>o A champion and a princess whose fierce passions overwhelm them as clashing armies struggle.<br/><br/>The Devil in Iron<br/><br/>o A coveted weapon, resting atop the chest of a perfectly preserved body lying in a chamber on a deserted isle.<br/>o A plan to entrap a foe with an unwilling captive\u2019s seductive aid.<br/>o A disappointed torturer, denied the opportunity to convince a recalcitrant captive to cooperate with his master.<br/>o A city of green stone which has appeared where only ruins were to be seen for all recorded history.<br/>o A city inhabited by the dead called back to half-life, in which a woman recounts to a visitor her death as a dream.<br/>o A city in which tunnels connect every house to that of its master and through which sacrifices are taken.<br/>o A blade of unearthly metal against which sorcery is impotent.<br/>o An invulnerable figure of base substance made animate and taking the shape of a man to hold a power older than all substance.<br/>o A leader of steppe horsemen swearing to show the woman who defies him a frontier city in flames.<br/><br/>For oracle themes/titles fitting the stories and offering ranges of theme for play -

All non-specific enough that players can be inspired by them, rather than being locked into a reference to the specific story the entry came from.  It's OK for someone to realize "Oh, that entry was inspired by Belit" -- but the entry should be fertile ground for the generation of many other characters and types.  <br/><br/>Entries inspired by a single story could <i>and should</i> wind up split across different oracles in the set.  The purpose of oracles is to generate inspiration for new ideas, so the Conan oracles should essentially be "put Robert E.

That means I'm skimming all 18 stories and trying different arrangements. I actually have the first one "Crown Upon a Troubled Brow" pretty much done. I'm going with a design where clubs are the ruler involved, Spades are the supernatural threat, Diamonds are items, place, etc., and Hearts are relationships.<br/><br/>So in Crown, clubs are rulers and leaders. (Interesting observation: Howard wrote a lot of "Queenmaker" stories, where Conan is key to strengthening the rule of a queen.) In Cities of Green Stone, clubs are pirates and mercenaries and diamonds are strange locations. Rogue in the House, diamonds are a city location, and so on. Categorizing and making sure most of the images are broad enough to imply enough character's is taking some time.<br/><br/>When I get a couple free Sundays I should have the rest -- a couple months, given my other activities.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142376/#Comment_142376" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-05T07:00:55+00:00" title="May  5, 2008  7:00AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alan, that sounds ridiculously sweet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
