Each is painted a garish colour and prepped to "shift" along an angle of slippage into a crazy new plane of existence. Their mission, in the words of Gene Roddenberry, is to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before. These are the voyages of the <i>DayTrippers.</i><br/><br/>Each Daytripper is equipped with enough fuel to support its crew and dimensional-shift engines for, predictably enough, one day. The idea is simple: slip into alternate universes and pocket dimensions, steal, trade or plunder enough goodies to pay for the next trip, ship upgrades and your student loans. The other end of the universe is a crazy place, filled with strange, dark cities, glowing swamps and crystal spires under mysterious stars. Danger bounds, but so do the riches. Time to zip-up that Automated Survival Suit and seal those pods tight! Let's slip-n-slide! </blockquote>This is the thread for the opensource development of "DayTrippers" - an OSR approach to a surrealistic science-fiction multiversal milieu, in which an assortment of colorful character classes pilot unique machines into divergent universes to retrieve items of value and bring them back home.  <br/><br/>I'm just going to repost everyone's contributions so far, to keep them all in one place.

The inner workings of the vehicle, a matter of highly contested debate in certain circles, are an application of Diaspora's radically new theories on the nature of reality.  If it works as Diaspora claims, an onboard pilot will effectively direct the vehicle in "slipping" relative to the fourth dimension while shielding the vehicle from all other dimensional vectors of force.  Few people in the world, even among his followers, claim to fully understand his work or its implications.<br/><br/>Over the last three years Diaspora has been working in an almost sleepless frenzy, his auto-broadcasted efforts unceasingly observed, recorded and archived, to be meticulously annotated and endlessly debated by a global audience of several thousand high-tech home-based tinkerers, many of whom see him as a role model, an exemplary champion of human technology and Promethean progress.  The inventor has come under constant scrutiny and occasional threat by energy companies and investigative bodies both governmental and private, a fact which he not only admits but celebrates and lampoons.  Unmarked black drones are seen frequently in the area of his 20-acre Sacramento ranch.<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">April 3, 2097</span></b><br/><br/>First Full-System test of TRA Pod 1, which due to its spindly appearance has been dubbed "Ariadne" by popular vote on DSource (the unofficial fancast of Diaspora Labs).  The network audience watches astonished as the pod disappears in an explosion of red sparks... <br/><br/>...and then reappears two minutes and thirteen seconds later, facing in the opposite direction, its position displaced by a little more than a meter, the left side of its carbonex casing streaked with deep gashes and burns.  The Ariadne lurches momentarily over a bent starboard forestrut and then collapses, rolling onto its side on the cement floor, smoking.  The support crew rushes in to examine the vehicle.  High levels of gamma and exotic spectral signatures radiate from the twisted pile, necessitating emergency security measures.  As the crew dons hazmat suits and the overhead sprinklers shoot into action, Diaspora's arm slowly emerges from the vehicle.  His quivering fingers tightly clutch something astonishingly black and highly reflective, roughly the size of an eightball.  Upon extraction the eccentric inventor is incoherent and incontinent.  He is quickly hospitalized.<br/><br/>Many weeks pass during which no news is heard.  Speculation runs wild on all the major tech talknets.  The mainstream media, encouraged by advertisers to dismiss Diaspora's theories, denounce the experiment as a ridiculous stunt and then quickly stop talking about it altogether.  Jealous rivals and mainstream science pundits lambaste him on the talknets for failure to adhere to professionally-recommended safety practices and professionally accredited peer reviews.  Someone points out that he never went to college.  Conspiracy theories begin to circulate regarding the inventor's state of health, the reasons for his continued silence, the parties for whom he is suspected to have been working, and most especially, the nature of the object he brought back from wherever he was for two minutes and thirteen seconds on April third.<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">June 27, 2097</span></b><br/><br/>Shortly before midnight in an unscheduled transmission from his bedroom in Sacramento, Diaspora opens up a broadcast talknet and addresses anyone who wishes to listen.  In the short but historical broadcast he announces that he will never again pilot a TRA Pod: His body is riddled with cancer, and he is not long for this Earth.  His fondest wish, he pleads of the opensource community, is to see his theories successfully implemented.  It is for this reason he has decided to release the hitherto-unpublished archive of fragmentary research and pure theory - some symbolic, some speculative - that fueled his mad dash during the creation of the ill-fated Ariadne.<br/><br/>Throughout the Summer, threadlines on DSource experience record-breaking amounts of traffic; new server slices are cloned repeatedly as freeventors and curious intellectuals from all over the world hurry to download the massive archive.  Tens of thousands of copies are distributed to who-knows-where; most of them as digital souvenirs, never to be unpacked.  Some are actually put to use.  Several hundred crowdsourcing projects, technology corporations, independent labs and lone enthusiasts quickly ramp up to begin unit testing their own variations on the Diaspora Device.<br/><br/>With a renewed sense of vigor the mainstream media, assisted by government and corporate scientists wearing power ties and class rings, publicly discredits the man and his theories completely.  Rivals and naysayers disparage his state of mind, calling his sanity into question.  Conspiracy theorists wonder out loud whether the man in the broadcast was the real Zayim Diaspora at all.<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">October 6, 2097</span></b><br/><br/>Diaspora Labs hosts a gathering of microfusion enthusiasts and temporal shift experimenteurs at the California ranch, for what is expected to be the great man's final public appearance.  Dozens of well-known independent talknet hosts and a few mainstream news reporters are present, minicams and backholo projectors at the ready.  The ranch takes on a carnival-like atmosphere of techno-excitement.  Diasporans of all types have brought prototypes of their own designs to set up throughout the rambling grassy area, interspersed with food booths and merch vendors.  The black drones are noted to be in buzzing attendance, and sunglassed men in groups of two and three walk calmly and observantly around the grounds, speaking quietly into their lapels.<br/><br/>Shortly before sundown, Diaspora is pushed slowly out onto the main stage in a wheelchair, surrounded by his technical assistants and support crew.  He is pale, wan, and speaks with great difficulty.  His words are instantaneously transmitted around the world, to be streamed to storage units in geekdorms and parents' basements everywhere.<br/><br/>"My fellow Prometheans," he says to the quieting crowd, "in a manner of speaking, precisely although not completely, it shall-then appear evident that in this arrangement of forces seeming to be a place-time which you call today, the metaphorical I-here-now shall appear to pass from one apparently-arranged superstructural set of bounded frequencies into another which is equally stability-generating via the naturally-arisingness of its own heuristic feedback mechanisms as inverted and perceived from the exterior along a selected or determined angle-duration of slip - this is only relative to the dynamic tendencies of the positions to which its elements appear, of course - and yet, never have I not been here-now with you.  And so."<br/><br/>He holds his bony hand aloft, gripping the eightball.  "The seeming appearance of what you will discover to have recognized within your own inverted perception after what seems to be the event," he says, "is nothing but the selected or determined proof that it itself <i>cannot be</i>, and yet <i>is</i>, itself as it were providing subjective validation of all tendencies selected or determined by your own stability-generating feedback mechanisms as operating or operated under the imperative of your naturally-arisingness as perceived along a selected or determined angle-duration of slip, which by then-place you will, of course, have unrecognized."  Withdrawing his hand, he fumbles for the walking-stick laying across his lap.  The black sphere remains where he left it, hovering in mid-air.<br/><br/># # #                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429856/#Comment_429856" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-24T14:23:42+00:00" title="March 24, 2014  2:23PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 25, 2014 10:45AM by AsIf.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">More Game History</span></b> - [exposition][concept][draft] - AsIf<br/><br/>Here's some stuff I assumed, but haven't said explicitly:<br/><br/>1. Diaspora (who I see as a fusion of Buckminster Fuller and <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-diy-engineer-who-built-a-nuclear-reactor-in-his-basement" rel="nofollow">Douglas Coulter</a>) is about to die. The eightball? I dunno. You tell me.<br/><br/>2. He was wrong about temporal slip: there is not just one direction of time, there is a large (maybe infinite) number of potential slip-vectors along various axes.<br/><br/>3. He was not properly shielded from the massive influx of radiation that his body endured during his journey into the unknown; this is what caused his cancer and will later inspire some other inventor to create the Automated Survival Suit.<br/><br/>4. I don't know if Diaspora knows this yet, maybe it's discovered later by someone else, but it's important for the game conceit: You must return as CLOSE AS POSSIBLE to your original starting-point in your home Earth's spacetime. Failure to do so will result in your being eradicated from this reality (or something equally harsh). If you're lucky/willful/zen/crazy (pick one?) and your vehicle's resistance fields are powerful enough, you can offset maybe twenty-four hours of shift in either direction. This means that from an observer's perspective on Earth, the duration of your trip must be less than 1 Earth day.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429859/#Comment_429859" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-24T14:33:09+00:00" title="March 24, 2014  2:33PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 25, 2014 10:45AM by AsIf.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Game World</span></b> - [setting][concept][draft] - Potemkin<br/>For some reason the Daytrippers premise is set in the same world as Otomo's <i>Akira</i> in my head.

Do you remember Porco Rosso, the Japanese flick about a biplane-flying pig? I recall loving the antagonistic Airpirate gangs in that movie and how they had these wildly different seaplanes with team colours and symbols and stuff. Travelling on a shoestring is totally an option, as is the incorporation of zenotech. Might scare off your sponsors but the Well of Souls seems to keep the lights on. Maybe there's a little Thunderbirds/Stingray in here.<br/><br/>Slipships is hilarious! Generally I'd been calling them Daytrippers but pretty much any term (technical or affectionate) to designate the only vehicle the game concerns is fine. Maybe playgroups will develop their own terms? <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429922">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429922/#Comment_429922" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-25T07:33:51+00:00" title="March 25, 2014  7:33AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 25, 2014 8:32AM by AsIf.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            THUNDERBIRDS!<br/><br/>I saw the PC and NPC adventurers as the "DayTrippers" and that's the name of the game.

Lets see what comes out in the fiction:<br/><br/><i>Tracy Island, otherwise known as Diaspora Ranch, is a modest holding nestled in California\u2019s increasingly arid central valley a little under an hour out of Sacramento. The journey soon exits the freeway and my editor and me are forced to follow the satnav on manual steer and as we creep slowly towards the checkpoint an audible hum draws our attention to hot black military drones casting their shadows over the track before us. Were it not for the inhospitable terrain and reception, \u201cthe Hangar,\u201d the Ranch\u2019s main building thats clearly visible over the top of the squat patrol hut, might well be the most photographed barn in America. It\u2019s the perfect picture of old timey rural America, hidden away in the golden grasses of historic Yolo County, but inside is the most outlandish cutting edges of intra-space technology \u2013 and today they\u2019re taking me along with.  Am I nervous? You betcha! Who knows what shit\u2019s going befall this plucky reporter? I was there at Dispora\u2019s last press conference and saw first-hand the ruined little man and his amazing treasure, the flying eight ball. <br/>  The smooth, dark glass of the rock out of space-time distorts my reflection as it floats still in a special alcove on the far wall of the plasterboard reception office. There is a small, cheap plaque with Diaspora\u2019s name. Despite the military personnel on the gate the first impression is one of a low rent law firm, once tasteful executive embellishments are now faded and dusty. The secretary chews gum and directs us lazily though into the Hangar. She does not offer to answer our questions. It\u2019s all very hush hush. Only the floor of the reception hints at the busting hive of activity beyond the quaint wooden doors, the nylon carpet has been worn completely bare by the daily passing of what rightwing pundits have denounced as \u201cmadmen, terrorists and cosmic saboteurs.\u201d  <br/>   Nigel Wainwright, chief engineer of the British-backed craft \u2018Merlin 7,\u2019 grins at me as he gives me the tour. \u201cWe\u2019re comparatively confortable compared to some of the other engines in the field.\u201d He gestures around at the bright team colours of the slip-pods, dappled under the strip-lighting and obscured by the barn\u2019s low beams. Each ship is sunken into a 6 foot concrete well, but even then the tallest and more advanced designs have to had the ceiling cut away to accommodate them. Tracy Island was the fictional south-pacific base of the futuristic do-gooders International Rescue in the Thunderbirds TV show, a hidden base filled with underground rocket silos and secret gadgets feels like a suitable call-name for this place. The sound of arc welders and NPR mingles with the calls of ground crew in prefight preparation and the loudspeaker announcements blares the departures the timetable. There are only four windows for slippage today and I get to know the order well: <br/>  \u201c1316hrs Craft Designation Yamato angle 345.6 inclination point-oh-two; 1324hrs Craft Designation Shenzhou 16 angle 346.1 inclination point-oh-two; 1459hrs Craft Designation Ariadne 9 angle 7-actual inclination point-oh-nine; 1902hrs Craft Designation Merlin 7 angle 13.7 inclination point-oh-oh-two.\u201d  That last one\u2019s us, I\u2019m told, and we\u2019re way too early, but Nigel is happy with the prep so far and agrees to tour us around what he describes as his home away from home with an eccentricity I\u2019m not sure to put down to him being a brit or having spent a little too long looking into the void. Merlin 7 itself is a 23 foot tall craft that looks a lot like a big blue lunar lander. Large white stars have been painted on by the crew in the style of the Disney character\u2019s robes. Thick cables connect Merlin to a bank of computers and it whirrs continuously, undercutting the general hangar din. It takes 12 hours to charge up for a slip and perform the required math. A platoon of karki-shorts wearing techies chat over coffee, e-ciggs and clipboards. It\u2019s going well, it seems. My attention is drawn to a whiteboard and soon I\u2019m getting a lecture in intra-space slippage. <br/>  \u201cYou go through the centre of the earth!\u201d says Nara Yoshitomo excitedly. Dr. Yoshitomo, recently of the Tokyo Institute of Aerospace Technology, draws a fast line downward through a blue circle. \u201cThe atoms of the craft are simply instantly accelerated beyond the speed of light and wham! You\u2019re out the other side of the earth and away before you can even blink. Of course, the slightest leak in the hull and the whole thing is Annihilated without trace!\u201d I can hear the capital a in Annihilated fall into place. In this business annihilation is a technical term, a real occupational hazard. \u201cOf course, it means we never have to worry about trash disposal. Just tether it to the outside of the craft and it\u2019s instantly atomised. The smell\u2019s bad but it\u2019s good for the planet.\u201d <br/>  \u201cOr planets, rather.\u201d Chips in Nigel. He confided in me that he must have seen at least nine of the elven alternate Earths that have been discovered in intra-space and is wildly regarded as an industry expert on the subject. \u201cThere\u2019s Jungle World, Nazi World, Water World, Silicon Earth, Earth Thirteen, Zombieland\u2026\u201d he counts off his fingers. The prospect of alternate realities seems suddenly intimidating, but, I\u2019m told, it\u2019s actually much easier than missions to deeper and darker places in the universe. </i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429955/#Comment_429955" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-25T11:42:28+00:00" title="March 25, 2014 11:42AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 25, 2014 11:43AM by AsIf.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Game Structure / Division of Creative Labor</span></b> [structure][mechanics]<br/><br/>THE GM CREATES:<br/>- DayTrips (adventures)<br/>- DayTripper NPCs<br/>- Other NPCs, Orgs, Locations, Events on Home-Earth and elsewhere<br/><br/>THE PLAYER CREATES:<br/>- a DayTripper PC<br/>- a DayTripper vehicle aka SlipShip<br/>- a Support Crew?<br/>Q: Are all 3 one package and the player controls them all?<br/><br/>Is the support crew kinda like the pit crew in <i>Car Wars</i>, little more than a list of names who never actually <i>do</i> anything in gametime?

I've done it hundreds of times.  And I think tight, high-color pamphlets are a great idea.  Like travel brochures, perhaps.  But the way I see it, they still need sidebars for the GM or notes in italics like <i>armor+2 v energy</i> or whatever.  Uncle Albert's guide was a great example of this.  It read just like an auto parts catalog, complete with illustrations and sales-pitchy jargon, and the game stats were printed underneath each "ad" in small type...<br/><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="image" src="http://asifproductions.com/sites/default/files/uncle_albert.png"/></div><br/><br/>Dragon Magazine used to print fairly complex adventures on one page.  And there's a one-page dungeon contest every year.  So the goal of punchy little adventures is totally achievable without reinventing the medium, especially if stats/rolls are simple &amp; scant.  And it's not too hard to create wandering encounter tables, etc.  I still want to be a GM though, and I want it to be easy and fun to write an adventure module for DayTrippers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429970/#Comment_429970" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-25T14:19:37+00:00" title="March 25, 2014  2:19PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 25, 2014 2:42PM by Potemkin.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, that sounds like a good compromise.

You have a limited supply of Effort than can be spent in a bid to overcome challenges/opposition, the Effort pool is refreshed after food/sleep/return to Earth. There are two Fuel pools, one for your spacesuit, one for your spaceship. Regular activity (life support, scanning, limited jet propulsion) drains one point per hour from both but special effects/conditions can be brought by spending more Fuel. Emergency repair, Return-slipping, defensive shielding/cloaking, mining, long-range scans, communicating with Earth etc. all cost 2-4 tokens. If you run out of Fuel you get stranded in intra-space! Thoughts?<br/><br/>Like..<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lifesuit</span><br/><br/>Burn Fuel when\u2026<br/><i>-You use the suit for a full day.<br/>-You use the suit for an hour in hazardous atmosphere or vacuum<br/>-The suit undergoes automated emergency repair. <br/>-You use the suit\u2019s medial scanners and administrators. <br/>-You broadcast large data packets or broadcast over great range. <br/>-You activate energy shielding. <br/>-You use the suit\u2019s jump-jets.<br/>-You use the suit\u2019s long-range scanning. </i><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Spaceship</span><br/><br/>Burn Fuel when\u2026<br/><i>-The ship supports the crew for a full day. <br/>-You return to Earth. <br/>-You use the ship\u2019s retro-thrusters. <br/>-You manoeuvre within an atmosphere. <br/>-You use the ship\u2019s long-range scanners.<br/>-You activate energy shields or cloaking.<br/>-You travel with heavy cargo (x2 Fuel costs for slipping/manoeuvring)<br/>-You use the ship\u2019s traction-pulse beams. <br/>-You channel energy to the automated repair systems. <br/>-You launch probes. <br/>-You activate mining equipment/research pods/FTL drives.<br/>-You activate the Medical Response Tank.<br/>-You broadcast up-angle to Earth.<br/>-You charge the Fuel reserves of a lifesuit.</i><br/><br/>I guess the conceit that's forming in my brain here is that the players are actually UFO-pilots and would appear to the worlds they drop in on to conduct research/pillage treasures as aliens with radically unidentifiable technology. So I really want to push this idea of the craft being this contained point of safety in a bizarre and inhospitable vacuum, so long as it has fuel. Not every adventure must be this resource-focused <i>2001 Space Odyssey</i> affair where PCs float about trying not to die but I like the idea of a few places being very procedurally demanding and fictionally dangerous.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429995/#Comment_429995" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-26T05:57:18+00:00" title="March 26, 2014  5:57AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 26, 2014 7:35AM by AsIf.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice!

It's normal to start the game with most Stats at 1 and a couple at 2.  Maybe ONE at 3 but that's it.  Normal unskilled people have 1 in every Stat.  The Stat Score indicates how many d6s you get to roll during Action Resolutions.  You're gonna keep the best one.

Something like...<br/>1 = trained<br/>2 = journeyman<br/>3 = expert<br/>4 = master<br/>5 = innovator<br/>6 = legend<br/><br/>Each Skill has a governing Stat (or maybe two, you can pick the best or most applicable one depending on the situation).  A Skill adds its level directly to the total.  A mod of +1 is non-trivial.<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Item Bonuses</span></b> [mechanics][resolution][draft]<br/>Items are rated in a similar way to Stats (1-6 logarithmic).

I admit that my expression of the system is more complex than the system itself.  Yes, I provided adjectives for all the 1-6 ranges, but they're merely descriptive and not necessary to commit to memory at all.  In other words, it's not about the difference between "challenging" and "difficult".  It's about the difference between "2" and "3".  I think this system is tremendously simple.  <b>Everything Is 1-6</b>.

("Owner" is a bad word because this is opensource, but I mean "the only person who can edit that post".)  At this point there isn't enough system here to really talk about yet, but eventually I hope that people will take whatever subsystems they like and use them.  The OP does call for opinions, and hopefully we get some more of them as the system develops, that would be great.  But personally I want to focus my main energies on building components, engineering subsystems, piecing together the overall system first in rough and then finer detail, etc., to provide a mechanic for this wonderfully weird idea.<br/><br/>I'm consciously trying to stay in a very "OSR" mode on this project, since that was part of the initial discussion.<br/><br/>As far as the above mechanic in general...  I thought about what the game's needs would be for a day or two.  The skitteryness and so forth.  I was using a 2-12 scale in my mind (shades of Traveler), but once I started writing it down and looking at the way it rode, I felt that extra 7-12 was just not necessary.  This is pulp sci-fi!  So instead I hit on the idea (not that I'm the first one to think of it) of letting your stats represent the <i>number</i> of dice you get to roll, and then modding it with skills &amp; items.  Once I started thinking that way, this system took me about 3 hours to build.  I decided to hammer everything in the multiverse down to a single, small, scale of 1 to 6, relying on the shifting odds of multiple dice to generate graduated odds of relative success.  Everything from stats to difficulty levels would be handled with that same ubiquitous scale.  By then you had already suggested the bipartite resolutions from <i>Archipelago</i> ("yes but", "no and", etc), which to me seem like a perfect fit for the descriptive freedom we want to give the GM.  That said, it's a draft concept, as noted.  If you have an alternate idea, give us a look at it!<br/><br/>(BTW, did you really mean to write "exactly as intuitive" - as a <i>bad</i> thing?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430051/#Comment_430051" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-26T22:57:06+00:00" title="March 26, 2014 10:57PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 1, 2014 6:07PM by AsIf.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, here comes another big chunk of hot steamy mechanical draftness!

These points will be divided up across everything: Your character, your gear, your crew, and your ship.  A beginning character gets 100 points to spend.  <i>(It's possible to imagine optimizing an adventure for a party of a known point value, but that's a topic for another post.)</i><br/><br/><b>I.

You may purchase Stats, Skills and Gear for them at the same prices shown above.<br/><br/><b>V. SlipShip:</b><br/>Decide on your ship's Seating Capacity.

Where the hell did these guys get a Plasma Torpedo from? Like, is that a thing people in this world just have access to? I was imaging taking along a pistol in-pod would be a Big Deal, but casually having interstellar, city-levelling plasma torpedoes for purchase is wild! <br/><br/>If slipcraft did have weapons, I imagine lasers would be lighter, cheaper and more versatile (point defense, scrap cutting and hole boring? Sign me up!) whereas torpedoes strike me as ...specialist? I very much side with Roddenbery on the place of weapons and violence in sci-fi: a part, but not the whole. <br/><br/>Listen, I like this - there's something about the meticulous point-buy of hull tonnage that is so oldshool <i>Traveller/Warhammer</i> that I can't stay mad. I get a boyish thrill out of the idea of people comparing slipcraft builds online like their 40k Army Lists. <i>"You need ion lasers before you slip to the dark sector, it's the best thing for piecing the machine heads there."</i><br/><br/>OSR, for me at least, is about the philosophy of play more than about how any specific system works. You could have the most cutting edge mechanics but still be asking "What do you do?" and you'd still be within the OSR in my book. I don't think the OS rules are particularly efficient and constantly having to houserule to make them so is a part of the playstyle - I'm not sure that's a part of the inspiration I want to repeat. Like, why do we need stats? We could have Skills and maybe a few colour bonus die ("Ambidextous," "True Believer," "Diligent Notetaker," etc) or BW style beliefs? These are the things that are really going to come up in play. If a player wants their character to be graceful and has the "Diplomacy," "Zenology," or "Psychology" Skills then, sure, what's the problem? If the fiction has established their character as a gruff mechanic or something, maybe not?                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430066/#Comment_430066" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-27T05:44:22+00:00" title="March 27, 2014  5:44AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 27, 2014 5:44AM by Potemkin.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>I.

I have no problem with that, and I don't see why anyone else should either.<br/><br/>I mean it when I say <b><i>opensource</i></b>.<br/><br/>I would love to see and utilize the work of others on various subsystems, but I'm not going to wait for those people to magically appear.  Instead, I write the subsystems that occur to me, and I consider them open to mutation or replacement.  In the meanwhile, these systems are what we have to work with (or ignore, or modify for home games, on an individual basis).  They are Version 0.1 Conceptual Drafts, all of them.<br/><br/>When I review the "Surrealism in Sci-Fi" thread, I see you pushing away from more freeform elements suggested by others, and in this thread you have made suggestions like "GM could play a character without conflict of interest" which to my mind pretty much <i>demands</i> tables for everything.  But I'm not building rules for every possible circumstance (like AD&amp;D).  Right now I'm just building rules for creating your character and his stuff, and it's fun to get pulpishly geeky about it.  The action resolution system is a single function for any type of action you might want to do.  It's not unlike the *World approach in that all action resolution is handled by a single rule, and that rule generates output which is both easy to calculate and highly subject to GM interpretation.<br/><br/>As far as charges of the system being "heavy"... Do you think so really?  All the rules so far fit into a 4-page document, including a page for my sample characters.  <a href="http://asifproductions.com/sites/default/files/daytrippers_rules_current_version.pdf" rel="nofollow">Here it is</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430107/#Comment_430107" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-27T12:21:36+00:00" title="March 27, 2014 12:21PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 27, 2014 12:21PM by AsIf.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ^^^ All the rules, that is, except your Crew Designations stuff, which I guess you wrote around the time I was creating the PDF.

One of the design goals I'm shooting for here is to have an "OSR" kind of experience for the player, but/while using a single simple mechanic for all action resolutions.  Another is to allow for a surreally-huge range of interpretive results as we go back into the fiction.  This places a pretty big burden on the GM, who will already be up to their eyeballs making up Surrealness and hopefully injecting Meaning into it.  Such narrative freedom is great for building fictional worlds but the whole point is to immerse the players by engaging with their characters, right?  So plainly put: The GM needs as many hooks into the PCs as they can get.  That's why we need Stats and a variety of useful details.  Sure, we want to be pulpishly simple and casually fun about it, because we're not writing <i>SpaceMaster</i> here.  But that said, the more detail on your character sheet, the more certain that the GM will know exactly what roll you need to make, no matter what freaky fucking weird-ass move you come up with.  See, every detail on your character sheet is a hook for the GM to grab.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430147/#Comment_430147" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-28T03:01:47+00:00" title="March 28, 2014  3:01AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 28, 2014 9:05AM by Potemkin.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Edit: It's been kindly pointed out to me that I'm being a jerk.

For the world/reality generation, I wanted to mention a neat thing in a game called Starbound.  Worlds are procedurally generated using seeds.  What's cool though is you can give your seed (in Starbound it's coordinates) to others and they get the same generated world.    I think it would be super cool to bind your axes of reality to something mechanic such that one group could say to another: "Hey, have you guys visited Reality 0099876?  We found this cool race of squids that were fighting for inequality of crustaceans!"  And the other group is like "Yeah, we went there and killed those squids to get the bounty offered by the crab-people!"<br/><br/>Just a thought....looking neat!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430388">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430388/#Comment_430388" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-01T11:02:37+00:00" title="April  1, 2014 11:02AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 1, 2014 11:14AM by AsIf.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love that idea.  It also injects "coordinates" into play as an actionable item.  Some would be traded freely, some would be highly secret.  You can envision a story in which a PC has to do something dangerous or costly to obtain the coordinates to a jealously-guarded node from another DayTripper team.  Our coordinates have to be more complex than 3space, obviously.  And some would have names, because they've become tourist destinations or corporate extraction zones, etc.<br/><br/>Ok, let's see...  in lieu of a 3d Cartesian grid, the fiction has implied a kind of "Slippage" along one or more "Axes" (vectors/dimensions) of reality.  I think, like the World DNA Project, we're still trying to piece together a complete map of the multiverse, one DayTrip at a time.  (Yes it's infinite but whatever.  We want to map as much as we can.)  We know some big chunks of it.  The three dimensions of Cartesian Space are Slip Axes.  (The more I write it, the more I am preferring the word "vector" to "axis".)  There could be any number of these vectors.  I can argue for a limited number, or I can argue for an infinite number.  Perhaps the syntax goes <i><b>VECTOR:DISTANCE</b></i><br/><br/>"Cartesian Space" is aka "3space" and 0/0/0 would be the galactic center.  The more well-known vectors and nodes have names.  Their discoverers, typically.  Spouses and kids, second favorite.  Deities and scientific or literary figures, also common.  Adventurous PCs can get a slip vector or a pocket universe named after them!<br/><br/>So the official coordinates for a compound slip to a known node might be something like:<br/><br/><b>POCKET UNIVERSE DEPARDIEU</b><br/>3SPACE: 115/-20.661/44.00002<br/>RUSSELL: 114.6<br/>V294: -55.095<br/><br/>A simple interstellar hop would need to measure only the threefold Cartesian coordinates.  A journey through time would involve at least a "Temporal" coordinate (Measured from the big bang? No, from the moment Zayim Diaspora disappeared on April 3, 2097!).  Probably a Cartesian one as well.<br/><br/>Might work, eh?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430392/#Comment_430392" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-01T12:23:45+00:00" title="April  1, 2014 12:23PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 2, 2014 8:15AM by AsIf.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Early on, Paul mentioned student loans.

So perhaps this is best modelled at table with 360 angles of slippage on the horizontal x axis, and another 180 angles of pitch on the y axis. I suppose it might help to envision a circle around the craft with 360 angles marked off - our Daytrippers select one of these, say, 48 degrees - then within the 48th degree you can "move" 180 degrees up or down. That's, like, just under 64800 potential destinations, not including the idea of "distance" travelled along that vector (the difference between temporal and physical travel perhaps).

Dr. Howard Belknap Barker, Professor Emeritus of SlipSpace Dynamics at the Western Academy of Intraspace Technology - that famous hall known by alumni as \u201cThe Ziggurat\u201d - has championed a theory which proposes a radical vision of bi-causality in the relation between subjective and consensus realities at both interpersonal and intra-personal levels.  On Barker\u2019s view, there exists (for example):<br/><br/>- a world for every dream or nightmare ever had by Edgar Allan Poe<br/>- a world for the sum of all dreams and nightmares ever had by Edgar Allan Poe<br/>- a world for the conscious experience of the historical reality of Edgar Allan Poe<br/>- a world for the unconsciousness contents of the mind of Edgar Allan Poe<br/>and<br/>- an "unfinished" world for every half-baked idea that ever arose in the mind of Edgar Allan Poe<br/><br/>In this much all conscious minds seem to be similar \u2013 i.e., there exists a whole set of Dream Worlds based on your personal dreams and your own consciousness, as well as mine, etc.  But since Poe has affected so many people with ideas springing from his fertile mind, he has managed to spawn additional Dream Worlds corresponding to these deeply-imagined and oft-reiterated works.  Thus we have:<br/><br/>- a world for every story written by Edgar Allan Poe<br/>- a world for the sum of all stories written by Edgar Allan Poe<br/>- a world for the sum of all impressions drawn by all readers ever from all stories written by Edgar Allan Poe<br/>and even<br/>- a world for the sum of all impressions drawn by all readers ever from all stories which have some similarity or connection to stories written by Edgar Allan Poe but weren't actually written by Edgar Allan Poe<br/><br/>Technically speaking, Dream Worlds are not \u201cWorlds\u201d but Pocket Universes, with their own internally-consistent laws of matter, energy, time and causality.  As reported by DayTrippers who have returned with their sanity intact, everything in a Dream World has a \u201cveiled\u201d quality to it and apparent common-sense conclusions are not always logical, even in regard to such fundamentals as the size and shape of your own body, the persistence of matter, or the law of gravity.<br/><br/>Such cognitive dissonance can lead to a subjective experience of displaced anxiety, intense frustration, overwhelming stress, self-loathing, or emotional outbursts.  It feels as if your perception of \u201cobjective\u201d reality is constantly and doggedly veiled by another, unseen reality of equal or greater cognitive impact.  This feeling has been described subjectively as being similar to \u201cbeta stage disorientation\u201d, in which sleepers cannot tell whether they\u2019re dreaming or awake, and experience a confusing, co-mingled awareness of both states.<br/><br/>Although Dream Worlds are certainly among the most terrifying and incomprehensible of all SlipNodes, they have also been the sources of some of the most powerful artifacts and innovative concepts ever brought back from SlipSpace.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430431">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430431/#Comment_430431" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-02T12:11:38+00:00" title="April  2, 2014 12:11PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not saying whether my characters are entirely <i>reliable</i> sources or not, of course.  :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430438/#Comment_430438" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-02T14:50:37+00:00" title="April  2, 2014  2:50PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 2, 2014 3:57PM by AsIf.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            more info on...<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Multiversal Chao</span></b> [settings][concept][draft]<br/>A whirling infidimensional maelstrom comprised of every type of energy from all universes, some collapsed into physicality, some in various phases of morphogenesis or demorphication.

Every Mission has three Aspects: <i>Node Type, Mission Type</i> and <i>Opposition Type</i>.  A fully prepared Mission will have one Node Type and one Mission Type, and any number of Opposition Types.  Missions may also possess any number of optional <i>Perks</i> and <i>Complications</i>.  Finally, every Mission has a <i>Clearance Level</i> (CL), a rough indicator of "clients' standards" for jobs of this type.<br/><br/><b>Selecting Mission Aspects</b><br/>The PCs are assumed to have cherry-picked this offer from many others, but of course low-CL offers are easier to cherry-pick than high ones.  In addition, the \u201csweetest\u201d missions tend to be brought to the attention of the most well-known, well-regarded and experienced characters.  In general, the higher the CL, the harder it is to find an offer that perfectly matches your personal desires, and therefore the less you get to say about mission design.  To determine the <i>Best Offer</i> the PCs have received lately, follow the three steps below:<br/><br/><b>STEP 1. MISSION TYPE</b><br/><i>First the player selects a Mission Type from the list below.  The type of mission the PC has been looking for will determine the CL of the mission.</i><br/>\u2022\tExploration/Into the Unknown\t(CL 1)<br/>\u2022\tEmergency/Rescue\t(CL 2)<br/>\u2022\tSightseeing/Tourism\t(CL 3)<br/>\u2022\tSurveying/Fact-Finding\t(CL 4)<br/>\u2022\tAcquisition/Trade\t(CL 5)<br/>\u2022\tPolitics/Diplomacy\t(CL 6)<br/><br/>Base Pay will be the CL times the number of crewmembers.

A couple of things I noticed (None of these are necessarily bad, but I figured I'd bring them to your attention):<br/><br/>- A lot of the skills attach to Grace and Memory, with a little Charm, and only one Might. No Health, no Psyche.<br/>- Fast-talking really should be Charm, not Grace. :P<br/>- It was hard to fine-tune a character. Take away a point in one thing, and you have to add a huge amount of points in the others. While you describe points as 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, one after the other, how it ends up when starting from 1 is 2, 6, 14, 30, 62. Double plus two of the previous price. That feels too much of a price leap. However, I'd be more likely to raise the lower prices than reduce the higher prices. At least on first consideration.<br/>- Why is ship creation part of character creation? Does a team share their points into a single ship? Some people could hoard points for themselves, and others could share generously. If the characters are provided with a ship, they would tend to be more powerful than those that have to buy it themselves.<br/>- If there could be some kind of "good stuff" for not using all your points, in contrast with the debt "bad stuff", that'd be nice.<br/><br/>Again, not necessarily bad points. Just thoughts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431807">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431807/#Comment_431807" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-28T22:01:10+00:00" title="April 28, 2014 10:01PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 2, 2014 3:09AM by AsIf.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            These are all great observations, some of them are probably crying out for rules or rule adjustments.  If the spirit moves you, please feel free to write any subsystems that appeal to you!  I don't claim to own this thing.<br/><br/>Everything I've submitted is a Draft, open to adjustment, replacement, or optional subsystems.  That said, regarding skill/item costs, there actually was some logic here. :-)  Their increased costs in version 0.0.8 were based on a closer approximation of the dice odds they generate:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://asifproductions.com/sites/default/files/xd6odds.png"/><br/><br/>The first set of 6 columns represents unassisted Stats from 1 to 6.  The other three sets represent the same Stats but with bonuses of +1, +2, and +3, respectively.  As you can see, Skills and Items (+ bonuses) are FAR more effective than Stats (additional dice).  Which is fine, I'm happy with the odds charts.  I just decided to reflect them in CP costs.<br/><br/>Why?  <b>Optimization.</b>  I want to be able to say "This is a 500-point adventure."<br/><br/>I can already hear Potemkin's blood rising. :-&gt;  But my view of this game - and remember this is just my view of it - is that it should be <i>based on</i> "simulationist" and "crunchy" elements, but with an ironic, simplistic and "pulpy" sensibility, and then coated in layers of prompted but extemporaneous narrative (hopefully facilitating a feeling of cosmic surrealism).  The action resolution table, for example, may superficially resemble a "hit chart" but it's not detailed enough for that - it really just serves as a narrative prompt.<br/><br/>Another way to put it is: DayTrippers is a little wacky on purpose.  It draws some fairly logical but deliberately odd datapoints and then forces you to connect them in impromptu ways, which tends to increase the "bizarreness factor" of the gameworld.  Have I found the exact right measure of wackiness?  Probably not.  Maybe that's why <i>you're</i> here. :-)<br/><br/>ETA - Fast Talk has been fixed in dev and will be released based on CHARM in version 0.0.9.

That honor goes to the FUDGE rules, and I should be embarrassed to admit I never knew that.  FUDGE of course is now better known as the mechanics underlying the FATE system.  Funny thing is, the more I read the FUDGE rules themselves, the more striking it seems that Steffan O'Sullivan and I take similar approaches, for similar reasons, in many ways.  For instance, FUDGE also uses a verbal difficulty scale and a deliberately chunky mechanic as a prompt for extemporaneous description.<br/><br/>TL;DR:<br/>DayTrippers belongs to no one.

But I do understand the problem some might have with it, and I've come up with these rules as a sort of compromise.  Let me know what you think.<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Who Pays for the Ship</span></b> [mechanics][characters][draft]<br/>The construction of your ship may be paid for in various ways:<br/><br/><b>SOLO GAME:</b> If there\u2019s one player, the PC, ship and crew all come out of the player\u2019s CP pool as described above.<br/><br/><b>GROUP GAME, SOLO OWNER:</b> If there\u2019s more than one player in the group but only one of their PCs owns the ship, that player must pay for the ship out of their own CP pool.  By custom and by default (i.e. unless stipulated otherwise by the players), if anything retrieved from a mission is ever divvied up among the crew, the ship owner gets a double share.<br/><br/><b>GROUP GAME, GROUP OWNERS:</b> If there\u2019s more than one player who wishes to be a part owner, all concerned parties must share in the expense of constructing the ship out of their CP pools.  The division of ownership (and shares) should mirror the division of construction costs, but players are of course free to come to their own arrangements.<br/><br/><b>BENEFACTOR/SPONSOR:</b> Alternately to any of the above (at the GM\u2019s discretion), certain missions or DayTripper Teams may be underwritten by institutions and organizations who foot the cost of the ship, or provide an existing vessel for the crew\u2019s use.  The nature of this arrangement may be academic (The Ziggurat or Universities), commercial (Tourist Companies and Consumer Advertisers), military (or corporate military), or even secret.  The benefactor/sponsor will of course do everything they can to ensure that they get a good return on their investment, and any spectacular failures will certainly result in a termination of the agreement.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431948/#Comment_431948" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-01T17:35:50+00:00" title="May  1, 2014  5:35PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 2, 2014 3:12AM by AsIf.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've put this off long enough, eh?  Sooner or later someone's gonna take some damage...<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Taking Harm</span></b> [mechanics][characters][draft]<br/>Harm is described by the GM based on what the attack was trying (or expected) to do, and on the fictional positioning of the characters involved.  An Attack result of \u201cYES\u201d or a Defend result of \u201cNO\u201d indicates that damage has occurred.  A result of \u201cAND\u201d or \u201cBUT\u201d indicates a positional modifier, a gain or loss of advantage, or one character taking control of an object or space (depending on GM\u2019s ruling).<br/><br/>When you take harm, you suffer a -1 penalty to one Stat (chosen by the GM as befits the situation).  The first -1 can be healed by resting for one day.  Subsequent harm will require weeks to heal.  If three of your Stats reach zero, you\u2019re dead.<br/><br/>The nature of the harm will suggest the Stat affected:<br/>BRAINS * \u2013 damage to the head or sensory systems<br/>CHARM \u2013 damage to the face , neck, mouth or skin<br/>GRACE \u2013 damage to limbs, phalanges, joints or spine<br/>HEALTH \u2013 damage to major organs or intestines<br/>MIGHT\u2013 damage to muscles, bones or nerves<br/>PSYCHE\u2013 damage to the brain, drugs, pain, duress<br/><br/>If the Attacker doesn\u2019t call a particular location, the GM will apply the damage to a logical area of the body affecting the highest remaining Stat possible.<br/><br/><i>Example: The first time Marty swings at Chaz, he calls out a shot to the face, and hits.  The GM rules that the punch indeed strikes Chaz in the face, giving him a split lip, and this is reflected by decrementing Chaz\u2019 CHARM (from 2 to 1).  Chaz\u2019 player writes the new \u201cHarmed Stat\u201d of CHARM 1 on the character sheet.  The second time Chaz takes a hit (same fight), Marty\u2019s player doesn\u2019t call a location.  The GM decides to take the point from GRACE, ruling that Chaz suffers a broken finger while defending himself.</i><br/><br/>* NOTE: In version 0.0.9, the MEMORY stat will be replaced with BRAINS.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431949/#Comment_431949" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-01T17:37:35+00:00" title="May  1, 2014  5:37PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 2, 2014 3:19AM by AsIf.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Healing</span></b> [mechanics][characters][draft]<br/>The first hit is free.  Well, almost.  If you take no more than a single hit, it can be healed by resting for one day.<br/>This capability is lost when you take a second hit.  When Harm has been determined and you\u2019ve suffered more than 1 hit, your wounds will require weeks to heal.  A rough approximation is one week per hit, given access to 21st-century medical technology, or two weeks per hit without it.<br/><br/>Here\u2019s the thing, though: Each week of rest, you\u2019ll have to make a HEALTH roll against your current damage total in order to actually remove a point of Harm.  This means it could take significantly longer than expected for you to heal.  If your HEALTH is zero then you\u2019re in a coma or in critical condition, and you\u2019re going to require surgery before your body\u2019s healing process can begin.<br/><br/><b>ORDER OF HEALING</b><br/>All harm heals in alphabetical order (you didn\u2019t know that?)<br/><br/><i>Example: Chaz takes 3 hits (CHARM, GRACE and MIGHT), and ends up in the infirmary.  He\u2019ll be here for roughly 3 weeks.  At the end of the first week he makes a HEALTH roll (1 die for a HEALTH of 1) against a DL of 3.  He gets a 5.  On the Action Resolution Table, this yields a result of "Yes And".  The "Yes" means one point of Harm will be healed.  The GM rules that the \u201cAnd\u201d means an extra point of Harm will be removed, and applies the healing to CHARM and GRACE.

The <i>Defender</i> (or the GM, for NPCs) will first make a roll to determine the Difficulty Level.  The <i>Actor</i> will then roll against that number on the Action Resolution Table.<br/><br/><i>Example: Marty wants to convince Choco, an NPC, to invest in his pyramid scheme.  The GM rules this will require CHARM or Rhetoric Skill.  Marty lacks the skill, so he will use his CHARM Stat (which is 3).  Because there is no innate DL for this task, the GM calls for a Contest Action against the NPC\u2019s BRAINS Stat (which is 1).  The GM rolls 1d6 for Choco and gets a 2.  Marty will roll 3d6 and take the best one, trying to beat a 2.</i><br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Action Resolution Table</span></b> <i>[repeated here to clarify the above rules]</i>\n<table cellspacing="10">\n<tr><td>MISSED BY MORE THAN 1 </td><td> \xa0\xa0 </td><td align="center"><span style="color: red;"> -- </span></td><td> \xa0\xa0 </td><td> no, and (negative) </td></tr>\n<tr><td>MISSED BY 1           </td><td> \xa0\xa0 </td><td align="center"><span style="color: red;"> -+ </span></td><td> \xa0\xa0 </td><td> no, but (positive) </td></tr>\n<tr><td>HIT EXACTLY           </td><td> \xa0\xa0 </td><td align="center"><span style="color: red;"> +- </span></td><td> \xa0\xa0 </td><td> yes, but (negative) </td></tr>\n<tr><td>EXCEED BY 1           </td><td> \xa0\xa0 </td><td align="center"><span style="color: red;">  + </span></td><td> \xa0\xa0 </td><td> yes (nailed it) </td></tr>\n<tr><td>EXCEED BY MORE THAN 1 </td><td> \xa0\xa0 </td><td align="center"><span style="color: red;"> ++ </span></td><td> \xa0\xa0 </td><td> yes, and (positive) </td></tr>\n</table> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431966/#Comment_431966" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-02T05:45:40+00:00" title="May  2, 2014  5:45AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 3, 2014 7:06AM by AsIf.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            and of course...<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Combat</span></b> [mechanics][combat][draft]<br/>Combat is handled in <i>Frames.</i>  Combat Frames do not represent any fixed period of time.

Instead, they represent those pivotal moments that capture the story of the fight sequence.<br/><br/><b>Combat Rolls</b><br/>For each Frame of combat, all involved characters declare what they want to focus on: <i>Attacking, Defending,</i> or <i>Doing Something Else.</i>  They also name the skills or Items they\u2019ll be using to do it (whether fighting or not).  All actions will then be resolved simultaneously.<br/><br/><b>Attacking</b><br/>For weapons or firearms, roll GRACE.<br/>For hand-to-hand or brawling, roll GRACE or MIGHT.<br/><i>+ Fighting Level + Item Bonus + Armor Bonus</i><br/><br/><b>Defending</b> (dodging, parrying or seeking cover)<br/>Roll GRACE.<br/><i>+ Fighting Level + Armor Bonus + Cover Bonus</i><br/><br/><b>Doing Something Else</b><br/>Make a normal roll for whatever action you are attempting.  <br/>The DL for any attacks against you will be 1 + your Armor Bonus.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Interpreting Combat Rolls</b></span> [mechanics][combat][draft]<br/>Defending rolls are only used to determine the DL for attacks.

The Goons are on the other side of a console that nearly spans the width of the room.  Our heroes want to get out the side door on the left.  That door is locked by a keypad security device DL 4.  The Goons draw their guns.<br/><br/><b>First Frame: </b>Chaz declares that he is running to the door,  tumbling and zigzagging.  The GM will rule this as Defending.  Marty declares he will be laying down covering fire, trying to force the Goons to duck behind the console.  Two Goons will shoot at Marty and two at Chaz.  Everyone rolls their dice.  The results are: <br/><i>Chaz (GRACE 3 Judo +1) = 6<br/>Marty (GRACE 3 Rifle +2) = 5<br/>Goons vs Chaz (GRACE 1 Firearms +1) = 4,  2<br/>Goons vs Marty (GRACE 1 Firearms +1) = 5, 6</i><br/>Resolution: Chaz runs across the room, weaving as he goes.  Since Marty\u2019s shots are targeted at the entire group of goons, the GM calls for a Contest Action vs a single GRACE roll for all of them, and rolls a 4.  Marty\u2019s 5 vs that 4 gives him a YES result.  The GM rules that Marty has succeeded in his goal: the goons\u2019  next Frame will be spent diving for cover.  But while he was doing that, they were shooting, so we resolve their actions as well.  The two Goons shooting at Chaz compare their 4 and 2 against his 6.  This gives them each a \u201cNO AND\u201d result.  The GM rules that they both miss, AND they both empty their clips. The two Goons shooting at Marty compare their 5 and 6 to his 5.  That\u2019s a \u201cYES BUT\u201d and a \u201cYES\u201d.  The GM rules that Marty takes two hits, choosing to decrement his CHARM and MIGHT Stats, BUT then one of the Goons fumbles and drops his weapon.<br/><br/><b>Second Frame: </b>Chaz declares he\u2019s fiddling with the keypad device.  This will be a Static Action vs DL 4.  Marty declares he\u2019ll run across the room to join Chaz.  The Goons are busy diving behind the console.  Everyone rolls their dice.  The results are:<br/><i>Chaz (BRAINS 2) = 4<br/>Marty (GRACE 3 and Rifle +2) = 5<br/>Goons (GRACE 1) = 4</i><br/>Resolution: Chaz compares his 4 to the security keypad\u2019s DL of 4.  That\u2019s a "YES BUT".  While the Goons dive for cover, Chaz succeeds in bypassing the security system BUT the door doesn\u2019t open automatically.  Marty makes it to his side.<br/><br/><b>Third Frame: </b>Chaz declares he\u2019s laying down suppressive fire while Marty opens the door and runs out.  The Goon with ammo pops up and fires at Chaz.  Another presses the alarm button behind the console.  Everyone rolls their dice.  The results are:<br/><i>Chaz (GRACE 2 and Rifle +1) = 5<br/>Marty (GRACE 3 and -1 for moving) =5<br/>Goon (GRACE 1 and Firearms +1) = 4</i><br/>Resolution: Marty opens the door and runs out.  Chaz compares his 5 to the Goons\u2019 4.  This gives him a YES.  The GM rules that Chaz has succeeded in picking off that Goon.  But not before the Goon\u2019s shot was squeezed off, so we resolve that action as well.  The Goon compares his 4 to Chaz\u2019 5.  This gives them a "NO BUT".  The GM rules that Chaz is not hit, BUT the door slides shut again.  Just then, the alarm goes off.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/albill" title="albill"><img alt="albill" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/348/nL4YMQPY0H7JF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/albill">albill</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432127/#Comment_432127" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-05T14:29:31+00:00" title="May  5, 2014  2:29PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, long thread.

But then, I guess I would, considering how many similar ideas I have kicking around my unfinished pile.\n<blockquote>You can read the description parts of any world book and then play "Roll for Shoes".</blockquote>\nIncluding that one! Well, a roll for shoes version of Stalker, anyway.<br/><br/>Just for perspective, if I were to tackle designing this concept, I would probably want to use some variation of these ideas:<br/><br/>In your home world, risky stuff has a simple bad / mixed / good results formula. I might use something like Apocalypse World, or maybe separate goal and consequences so the player can choose when a mixed result comes up. In other dimensions, however, because they are supposed to be surreal, your level of success determines how many words you get access to. There is a deck full of words, or maybe you draw them from a hat, and maybe each other world has their own list of words (you would need to always be adding new words, so they don't become too familiar, so whichever way you do that). Once you have your words, you need to use at least one of them to explain how you succeed at your action or undertaking and how you avoid the consequences. If you can't, the GM makes things more difficult and/or imposes penalties.<br/><br/>I like Potemkin's idea of having energy tokens, although I think characters having energy, like stamina or willpower or determination, is more important than the suit having energy. You could use up your energy to draw more words or whatever, or trigger special powers if you have any. The rules could also do a neat thing with energy tokens and wounds: some wounds would drain your energy tokens massively (sucking chest wounds, etc) but sometimes the adrenaline would kick in and a terrible wound (losing a hand, for example) wouldn't reduce your energy at all, or would even give you a bonus (+1 for adrenaline!). The ensuing blood loss is what would sap your energy.<br/><br/>I also like the idea that you can return to places, just like you can return to the same dungeon over and over. Often, you need to! Or you don't get everything there is to find. Or anything, sometimes. This is where difficulty levels can be good: the PCs find that they are out of their depth, and they need to back off and level up before they come back and try it again, this time with an actual chance of success. In my experience, difficulty levels for the sake of verisimilitude have little or no effect on player behaviour, and don't actually communicate verisimilitude as well as plain old description. Whereas if they create goals, either PC improvement goals, or long-term exploration goals, they can drive play forward really well. That's just my experience and opinion, though. I started a thread here a long time ago where I asked what difficulty levels are good for, and other people had other answers, so. However, I totally understand the impetus behind wanting point-levels for adventures, that's sensible.<br/><br/>I'd go with 3d6 in order, doesn't matter if you roll low, that's your dude, you start at level 1. While this might get old for repeat players, who already know about DayTripping, I don't really think it's a good idea to start off with experienced characters, unless there's some aspect of DayTripping that has become normalized or something. An experienced character should have the actual scars of actual experience, I think. I like point buy for the ship though, and maybe the point-value of the ship would correlate to debt, or would vary based on the point-value of the adventure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433249/#Comment_433249" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-31T17:54:24+00:00" title="May 31, 2014  5:54PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also: <a href="http://www.boneville.com/comic/rasl-issue-one-cover/" rel="nofollow">RASL</a> by Jeff Smith, fuck yeah.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19304/daytrippers-opensource-game-development" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19304/daytrippers-opensource-game-development" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19304/daytrippers-opensource-game-development/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19304/daytrippers-opensource-game-development/p3" rel="next">3</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19304/daytrippers-opensource-game-development/p3" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F19304%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F19304%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>[DayTrippers] - Opensource Game Development - Page 3 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19304/daytrippers-opensource-game-development/p3" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="[DayTrippers] - Opensource Game Development - Page 3" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19304/daytrippers-opensource-game-development/p3" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="@Johnstone: RASL is awesome, thanks for the link!

Pdfs are pretty much THE WORST possible format for this, short of, dunno, print-only or audiobook or something. (And pdfs in two-columns layout especially.)<br/><br/>After all, the the point of CC licensing is that people can take your work verbatim and use it, if they want to, but getting information out of a pdf is a huge pain and generally involves lots of manual correction and detailwork.<br/><br/>For a few halfbaked thoughts on how this could be made easier, see <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/464850/#Comment_464850" rel="nofollow">my post on the hacky Subscenes</a> thread.<br/><br/>The easiest way is probably to publish a plaintext version, ie. a txt file without much in the way of layout.
