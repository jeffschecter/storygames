<p><strong><em>Invisible Shepherds</em></strong> is my game about a team of elite cyborgs trying to save the world from a very quiet alien invasion and dealing with the personal issues that come from being put in that position.</p>
<p>I've been working on some of the balance issues in skills authoring, figuring out how many skill points a beginning character should get, etc.  But while I've been doing that, I've been second-guessing myself about the skills I've decided to include in the game.  What I'd like for you to do is look over my list and see if they seem groovy to you.  If something seems wrong, then I want you to tell me so.  Or just ask me digging questions about them.  That way either I'll be able to answer all the questions to my satisfaction and no longer be second-guessing myself about them, or I'll refine the list based on the answers to the questions... and no longer be second-guessing myself about them.</p>
<p>Here's the list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Martial Arts  </li>
<li>Side-arms  </li>
<li>Heavy Weapons  </li>
<li>Command  </li>
<li>Deceive  </li>
<li>Impress  </li>
<li>Athletics  </li>
<li>Acrobatics  </li>
<li>Private Vehicles  </li>
<li>Military Vehicles  </li>
<li>Breaking &amp; Entering  </li>
<li>Hacking  </li>
<li>Technician  </li>
<li>Investigate  </li>
</ul>
<p>I'm anticipating some particular questions, and of course I'm ready for those, but I'm really looking forward to the questions that I'm not prepared for.  Please hit me with anything from "Why a skills list in the first place?" to "What, no 'Stealth'?"</p>

                            I'm extremely interested in your answer to "Why a skills list in the first place?"  I mean, why pose the question and not write up your answer?<br/>
<br/>
I take it this is more of a ass-kicking-of-subtle aliens game rather than an uncovering-creepy-machinations game?  Thus three different fighting skills, two action skills, two driving skills, but only boring old Investigate.                        </div>

<p>I didn't answer it right away 'cuz I really wanted to get people's interest piqued.  See?  Worked!</p>
<p>Ok, so I totally went with a skills list compltely-on-purpose for this design.  My goal is to direct the color of the scenes of the game by directing the color of the conflicts.  To direct the color of the conflicts I create a list of skills that point toward the four flavours that I want to play in this game;  Violence, Socializing, Espionage, and Chase-scenes.</p>
<p>How's that for an answer?</p>
<p>Yeah, totally ass-kicking the aliens.  Creepy might show up, but not as part of the design.  Creepy never entered my head as I was working on it.  It's kinda like;</p>
<ol>
<li>There's an alien.   </li>
<li>What Bad Thing has the alien done, or is planning to do?  </li>
<li>What do we need to do to stop it?  </li>
<li>What's in the way of us stopping it?  </li>
<li>Why is my mother mad that I don't return her calls while I'm fighting aliens in Antartica?   </li>
<li>Oh yeah, because I can't tell mom that I'm fighting aliens in Antartica.  </li>

I totally love the idea of rolling Deceive, Command and Impress to retain the love and respect of my mom.  Those are mandatory examples of play, IMO.  <br/>

<p>Well, it's unrelated to the skills-thing, but it's a part of the game that I'm pretty excited about, so I'm all about chatting it up here.  Here's the simplified version;</p>
<ul>
<li>Each PC has between 1 and 3 <em>Issues</em> that they need or want to deal with.  Similar to, but not to be confused with PTA Issues.  </li>
<li>Each session you have the opportunity to address one or more of your character's issues.  The more you address them, the more Tension you create.  </li>
<li>Tension yeilds dice.  It's over-simplified, but that's the important part.  The bigger your issue gets, the more resource you have for ass-kicking.   </li>
</ul>
<p>So, to give some short &amp; sweet exampling, let's say that you've got the issue of "Overprotective Mother".  You would have authored your issues, there won't be any kind of list to pick from in the text.  During this particular session you decide to address your issue of having an overprotective mother by calling for a conflict where your character tries to convince mom to stop calling so often.  Whichever way that conflict goes, you've increased the Tension in your Overprotective Mother Isssue.  Next session you'll get more dice from that issue than you did for this session.</p>
<p>So, mom getting on your case lets you kick more alien ass.</p>

                            My gut reaction to this is that every skill should be applicable to eviscerating aliens or smoothing things over with your girlfriend.  To hell with "heavy weapons".  It's semantics, but I think it could be really cool and important.<br/><br/>I don't really understand the source material, obviously, so I can't critique your decision to have multiple skills representing trained physical movement, multiple skills for <i>driving</i>, etc.  Maybe that's right on.  But man, I don't want to know how to drive a tank but be unable to drive my mom's car.  If I take driver I want to be, you know, Howlin' Mad Murdock.  That's what I'm saying by taking that skill.                        </div>

<p>I'm gonna take yer rant and turn it into a question, Jason.</p>
<p>"Why have specific skills like <strong>Heavy Weapons</strong> and <strong>Side-arms</strong> when <strong><em>Killin'</em></strong> could do the same thing?"</p>
<p>Broadly, it goes right back to the reason why I'm going with a skills list in the first place.  Because I want players to take one look at the character sheet and know that this game is about both the guns in their holsters and the weapons that can shoot holes through entire buildings.  I want them to make a niche and color choice between being the guy who's killer with motorcycles and sportscars and the guy who knows all there is to know about tanks and nuclear submarines.</p>
<p>More specifically, I want the players to choose between being the guy who relies on subtlety and the guy who comes in blazing.</p>
<p>I'd like to address one part of your post very specifically;</p>
<p><code>But man, I don't want to know how to drive a tank but be unable to drive my mom's car.</code></p>
<p>There is nothing in this sytem that would say that you cannot drive mom's car.  A lack of skill in Civilian Vehicles does not mean you don't know the accellerator from the brake.  It means that you don't resolve conflicts in mom's car.  You resolve conflicts in APCs and Armored Helicopters instead.</p>
<p>And that's what you say by taking Military Vehicles without taking Civilian Vehicles as a skill.  That you intend to resolve your conflicts with big wheels, not little ones.</p>

<p>Ahh... the gloves are off, Jason... Now I've gotta respond point by point...</p>
<p><code>Also be consistent. You Command, you Hack. Or you are doing some Commanding and some Hacking.</code></p>
<p>I've thought a bit about my inconsistancy with the skill titles.  For playtest rules, I'm quite happy with them.  If I write Command, you get the idea that it's about telling people what to do.  It tells me, the player, to command people.  If I write Commanding, it's more like an attribute.  Leads me to say shit like "My player is commanding, so people listen." instead of "My dude tells your dude to sit the fuck down."  Similarly, if I put "Hack" as a skill title... well, that would confuse me.  My character is a hack?  Like, a bad actor?  Naw.  The skill titles tell me what they're all about.  I think they tell you what they're all about.  Consistancy be damned.</p>
<p><code>How does a skill like "Technician" bring the 110% fun?</code></p>
<p>Because it's a technological world, and I wanna win conflicts with my characters' knowlege of technology and ability to fuck with it.  Bien?</p>
<p><code>Why is "breaking and entering" differentiated from "hacking"? The principles of surreptitious entry are very similar. What's "investigate"?</code></p>
<p>One is illicit physical entry and the other is illicit electronic entry.  Total color.  Subtlety.</p>
<p><code>Any police larceny investigator is a competent burglar as well; you can't defend against hackers without being one.</code></p>
<p>Defend?  There are no defensive skills on that list.  All of these skills are <em>very</em> offensive.  Investigate is the bastard child of the list.  Might get removed from the family at any time.  Kinda got put on the list a few days after I generated the other 13 skills.  Was born in a fit of wanting clue-finding.  But let me explain my choice to keep it for now.</p>
<p>Investigating is about finding information in the physical world.  Fingerprints and shoe prints.  Deducing what kind of cybernetic chassis the perp has by the side hole he left in the concrete.  Determining that the perp has a complete cybernetic chassis in the first place by the type of food wrappers he left behind.</p>
<p>That's the kind of scene I'm trying to point at with Investigate.</p>
<p><code>Why weapon categories rather than "close quarters battle", or other procedural skills that presume weapons knowledge as well as tactics?</code></p>
<p>That's an excellent question.  But I think I've already answered it.  Color &amp; subtlety.  I don't care how far away your target is.  I care how much oomph you can bring to the fight.  I care how likely you are to end up on the 6 o'clock news from that choice.  Tactics?  Tactics as a skill choice doesn't tell me anything about your characters' subtlety.</p>
<p>-Eric</p>
<p>edit PS-  Awesome questions.</p>

                            If it is all about super-subtlety versus the overwhelming application of force, why have skills at all, instead of a two dimensional slider or Likert scale?  <br/><br/>"I am NOT SUBTLE.

                            Because the skills aren't two-dimentional.  The skills provide the subtlety scale, point in the direction of the four types of scenes I want the game to revolve around (violence, socializing, security, and chases), and they provide color.<br/>

Other approaches may be just as appropriate to the game, but I haven't seen anything else yet that would provide all three solutions to these design goals.<br/>

<p><code>Athletics vs. Acrobatics? Which decides what?</code></p>
<p>The Atheletics &amp; Acrobatics duo is one of the decisions I've been waffling with since I authored them.  I want to point at narration that includes crazy gymnastic stunts, a la Aeon Flux, <em>and</em> things like running fast and jumping from building to building.  If I could find a single word that inspired both types of narration I'd go with it.</p>
<p><code>And who decides what?</code></p>
<p>The player who's involved in the conflict does.  You are the final authoity on the use of your skills.  Subject to the approval of your peers and supported by a very short write-up of my intended useage of each skill in the text.</p>
<p><code>I wish to override the controls on the electronic door to enter a building, which do I use?</code></p>
<p>The one that <strong>you</strong> think is best supported by your narration.</p>

                            Ok, so this Ghost in the Shell inspired, right?  Let me make a few observations on that basis:<br/><br/><i>Side-arms <br/>Heavy Weapons </i><br/><br/>It really does seem that this distinction doesn't exist so well in the Ghost universe--if you know how to shoot, you know how to shoot.  You want your cyborg who usually just shoots a pea shooter to be able to walk over to the wrecked attack plane and heft its particle gun from the wreckage so that they can blow the oncoming 'copter out of the sky next.<br/><br/><i>Private Vehicles <br/>Military Vehicles</i> <br/><br/>It seems like all the cool kids in the show can use just about any kind of vehicle--if you want to be the wheelman, you drive everything.<br/><br/><i>Martial Arts</i><br/><br/>Cool. <br/><br/><i>Command <br/>Deceive <br/>Impress</i><br/><br/>Also cool--I can even see a whole 'impress the bureaucrats so they stop getting in the way of the mission' sort of scenarios with these skills.  Especially if you can bank with the other skills for a 'big payoff' at the end--i.e. deceive and command with the goal of setting up a big 'impress' payoff.<br/> <br/><i>Athletics <br/>Acrobatics</i><br/><br/>I just dislike this distinction on principle--I've ended up with it a few times on my own and was never very satisfied with my rationales.  What, gymnasts aren't athletes?  If you want to make big distinctions between the two, why not have one skill (athletics) with some cascading subcategories?   If you don't want to enter on that path, why not just combine them and be done with it--'my guy is all over physical stunts' seems good enough to me.<br/><br/><i>Breaking &amp; Entering <br/>Hacking </i><br/><br/>Cool--I like the color between the two types.  The hacker likely wouldn't know what to do if they actually ran across an honest to goodness padlock.  My question, though--how often would the players actually come across an honest to goodness padlock that isn't attached to a control panel they can just hack?<br/><br/><i>Technician <br/>Investigate </i><br/><br/>I like these, actually--I think some of the other skills (weapons and vehicles) should be more like them.  They are vague enough to be flexible in play and colorful enough that players shouldn't be tempted to exploit that felxibility.  I would almost be tempted to let most other forms of breaking and entering fall into technician...unless this is your 'stealth' category in disguise.  In which case, why not just call breaking and entering something like sneakiness?<br/><br/>Which reminds me--why is there no stealth skill?  It seems like there is plenty of sneaking in before killing to be had.                        </div>

<p>In a really broad stroke, a security scene is one where your characters go somewhere that someone is trying to keep them from going.</p>
<p>You do occationally declare that you're involved in a particular kind of scene, but not along those lines.  So no, you would not declare that you're in a "security" scene.  I'm not even sure that those four divisions will show up in the final text.  They're really just part of my design notes.</p>
<p>Socializing is just as well represented as the other four categories.  Does Command say something about subtlety?  Yes.  Because between Impress, Decieve, and Command, I see Command as being the least subtle.</p>
<p><code>You need to "command" an AFV crew.</code></p>
<p>Do you mean to say that because Command can be used outside social situations that the social category is diluted?  If so, I disagree.  Sure, you can totally use Command outside of social situations.  But then, there are several ways to use the skills from other categories in social situations too.  For example,</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>Use Martial Arts to propel your team to the championship, in an address of your issue "I want to show my son how cool his father is."</p>
<p>Use Side-arms to attempt to join the elite gun club that your sister's killer belongs to.</p>
<p>Use Acrobatics &amp; Athletics in the bedroom.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Now, for all three of these examples, I'd probably argue that <strong>Impress</strong> is a more suitable skill.  But I'd also argue that <strong>Military Vehicles</strong> is a more suitable skill when commanding your AFV crew too.  My point is that the cross-polination of skills works just as well in each direction.   [edit to say that I mean I'd argue that point while playing, not as part of this design process.]</p>

<p>Excellent points, Ian.</p>
<p>First I'd like to say that while this game is heavily inspired by GITS, it's not an effort to replicate that fiction whole cloth.  There are large chunks of inspiration at work here from sources like <em>RoboCop, 80's Action TV (Charlie's Angels, Knight Rider, &amp; A-Team), Appleseed, Black Magic M-66, and James Bond</em>, in no particular order.  So, in response to your observations about a disconnect between the game and the show, I say that a disconnect is a-ok.</p>
<p><code>Athletics &amp; Acrobatics.  I just dislike this distinction on principle--</code></p>
<p>Me too.  I want to blend them together into a single skill, but I'm missing a title that's evocative of both.  As of right this minute, I'm considering just using both words to create a single skill called "Athletics &amp; Acrobatics."</p>
<p><code>My question, though--how often would the players actually come across an honest to goodness padlock that isn't attached to a control panel they can just hack?</code></p>
<p>As often as a character shows up who has more points in B&amp;E than in Hacking.  Check this out;</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>Eric:  "Sorry, dude, the door to the laboratory is totally sealed.  There are no handles, no windows in it, and all the mechanisms for moving the door are carefully concealed and blast-protected.  The only way you're getting through that door is to Hack the computer."<br/>
   Jason:  "That's cool.  I'll just go back one hallway and take out one of the ceiling tiles.  I'll use my <strong>B&amp;E skill</strong> to follow the cooling pipes to the proper room &amp; quietly cut a small diameter hole in the ceiling just above my target."</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><code>Which reminds me--why is there no stealth skill? It seems like there is plenty of sneaking in before killing to be had.</code></p>
<p>I'm glad you asked.  I'm kinda surprised no one else has yet.  But, once again, check it out; It's already covered.</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>"Using B&amp;E I'm going to turn the tumblers nice &amp; slow to keep any of the noise from echoing down the hallway."<br/>
   "If I just splice some video feed in to the security cameras with my Technician skill to keep us from showing up on tape."<br/>
   "I Hack his eyes."  (oh yeah...)</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>And, for a little of the cross-pollination...</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>"I'll don my electronic camouflage and roll my Deceive to convince the guards that I'm not here."</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>I think that a Stealth skill would give us such inspiring narration as "I sneak past the guards".  Probably wouldn't get any of that creative stuff.  Or at least, not as often.</p>

<p>Ha.  I fold to your call of BS.</p>
<p>I agree with your breakdown except on one point.  Athletics &amp; Acrobatics is in the same category as the driving skills.  They are all chase-scene skills.</p>
<p>Why not let people author their own skills?  I think I've already answered that a couple different ways.  I want color, a subtlety spectrum, and the four divisions.  If the subtlety spectrum is three stages and it crosses with a four-scene division, that provides for 12 skills.  Lo, I have 12 skills.  Flavor-full skills, I think.</p>
<p>What would I add to the game by not labeling the skills as I have?  Some small advantage of creativity when authoring the character, certainly.  An advantage that is easily balanced by the advantages of the skills list being pre-written.  Like inspiring more creativity during play, and speed &amp; ease of character authorship.</p>

                            I like the 'sneaky' route to stealth and it seems a nice way to encourage more creative stealth-based encounters.  I also like the description of the difference between B&amp;E vs. Hacking...pleasing color with some nifty payoff.<br/>
<br/>
With all the influences you mention, I still think you should collapse vehicle skills--when I have run games with players where driving and piloting vehicles came up, someone wanted to be the *wheelman* not just the wheelman when it's x, y, or z.  The differences between private and military seems so much less strong than that between air vehicle and land vehicle, that I suspect most players will feel a little cheated by having to go for both.  Bond can drive a tank, fly a helicopter, race through the streets in a ferrari...<br/>
<br/>
With the weapons--is it fair to say you are going for this sort of vibe:<br/>
<br/>
(Character 1)"Oh man, this thing is huge, we're gonna need something big..."<br/>
<br/>
(Character 2) [Walks around back, pops the trunk, pulls out a gi-normous gun that he almost has to strap into] "Oh, I've got something big"<br/>
<br/>
Where it is character 2 who is the go-to guy for the 'big stuff'?  The sort of guy who may not have a great aim, a quick trigger finger, but when you absolutely, positively need to kill every motherf***er in a city block, you call him?  If so, then I think I grok the distinction.                        </div>

I also like how the no-stealth skill makes it easier for a *group* to sneak around rather than have the one or two sneaky guys always doing stuff separately.<br/>

                            My question is about the Attributes (or whatever) and how they relate to skills. <br/>
<br/>
Are the attributes Fight, Pursue, Infiltrate, Communicate? The groupings for the skills make them seem like a subcategory of a larger element. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I want to treat it as specialization: I roll Fight to kill someone, but I get adds or bonus points if I'm doing it with Heavy Weapons.  Roll Pursue to chase down the baddie, but get extra pts. doing it on foot instead of with a car (Parkour, baby!)<br/>
<br/>
This was how I was going to organize my GIS tribute game, so I may be trying to subvert you. Sorry, it's just how I think about a GIS game now. Mine will wither on the vine, so there's no conflict of interest here.                        </div>

                            I'm also getting a mental image of the four skills categories being simply 'space' the player has allocated for a mission in their internal computers (I assume no non-cyborgs, right?). <br/><br/>At the beginning of each mission, the player has the character allocate time and resources, Matrix-style to what they know and how much: "I know kung-fu!" You reallocate based off of the mission and your class each mission, and change things that didn't work, and maybe get a bonus based off of what you've chosen in the past ("These maneuvers, they're getting hardwired in my muscles!")<br/><br/>Does that make sense?                        </div>

<p>I managed to zoom here to work with an hour or so to spare.  No traffic on the way to Charlotte today.</p>
<p>Ian,</p>
<p>That's <em>sort of</em> the distinction, but it's more complex than that.  There are other reasons for the distinction.  Reasons that won't become apparent untill we talk about the rules that are connected to the skills like Toys (weapon &amp; tools &amp; vehicle stats), Teeth, and Public Opinion (take a peek at my other thread for an overview of Teeth and PO).</p>
<p>Before we get to talking about those other rules, I want to be confident that these skills are exactly what I want.  And this grilling has just about got me to that point.</p>
<p>Russel,</p>
<p>There are no Attributes.  None.  The four categories were just the four flavors of scenes I knew I wanted when I started creating my list of skills.  Those four categories will probably not make any kind of appearance in the text of the rules.  Simply creating violent skills, sneaky skills, social skills, and chase skills gets me to my goal.</p>
<p>Don't let my design stop you from working on your own GITS game.  Keep in mind that the fiction was just my first inspiration.  I just happened to be watching an episode when the first thoughts came up.  It's grown away from that source quite a bit now.  And even if it hadn't, there's no reason why there couldn't be two games from the same source material.</p>
<p>Mark,</p>
<p>It makes sense, and um... no.  There will be the possibility of non-cyborgs, and this design does not allow for a constant reallocation of resources.  At least, not the resources of your skill points.  One your character has points allocated in a skill, there's no going back.</p>
<p>Everyone,</p>
<p>Let me address something I seem to see bubbling below the surface.  There seems to be some implications in posts here and there that some of you may be assuming that a lack of points in a particular skill means that your character is completely unable to perform in that category.  That any narration in those areas will be met with responses like "Dude, your guy doesn't know how to pilot tanks.  See, no points on your sheet for Military Vehicles!"</p>
<p>No.  Bad.  If you are thinking this way, please put it out of your head.  This game will very specifically NOT go that way.  Few or no points in a particular skill means that you will have very little chance of winning a conflict if and when you're called on to use that skill.  It does not mean a cock-block on narration.</p>

<p>A few minutes before my flight, and I think I may have gotten what I was looking for out of this thread.  I've found the refinement for the list that I was looking for, was able to articulate what and why I wanted from my skills list, and got rid of my second-guessing.  I do have some things to consider for a bit longer, like do I feel that the three categories of violence are likely to provide the type of narration that I'd like to see, but overall it's been just the kind of productivity that I needed.</p>
<p>Here's the updated version of the list;</p>
<ul>
<li>Martial Arts  </li>
<li>Side-arms  </li>
<li>Heavy Weapons  </li>
<li>Command  </li>
<li>Impress  </li>
<li>Deceive  </li>
<li>Atheletics &amp; Acrobatics  </li>
<li>Civillian Vehicles  </li>
<li>Military Vehicles  </li>
<li>Technician  </li>
<li>B&amp;E  </li>
<li>Hacking  </li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to tear away as long as you'd like.  I'll keep answering as long as you keep asking.  I'll plan on making a new thread tomorrow to discuss the rules that connect to the Skills, and to answer the questions you have that those rules will address.</p>
<p>Thanks very much.</p>

                            Sidearms is the wrong term.  Is an AK-47 a sidearm?  If by sidearm you mean "pistol", you ought to make that clear (and change Heavy Weapons to "everything else").  If you are referring to individual weapons fielded by infantry, the term proably ought to be "small arms".  <br/><br/>Howling Mad Murdock, dude.  Having two categories for vehicles but only one for <i>the entire realm of non-violent phsyical activity</i> makes no sense to me.  Yes, it's color, but it is also a value statement during character generation - making the wheelman is twice as expensive as making the acrobat.  Both of which are cheaper than making the face-man or the soldier or the brainiac.                        </div>

                            Well, I just want to repeat my concern about not collapsing the vehicle skills.  The explanation about how the players will not be blocked in the narration is nice, but I still think someone who wants to be wheelman (or woman ; ) will feel a little frustrated by the split.  Being the wheelman doesn't just mean you can drive a vehicle, but that you can rock the house with your driving, period.  Saying "you can totally rock a contest in the tank, but are out of luck when it comes to a ferrari" seems sort of weak.<br/>
<br/>
Here is something you might be able to clarify for me: what distinguishes a 'military' vehicle from a 'civilian' vehicle in the game?  I think a secondary problem I may be having is I just can't buy that someone who can drive *any* military vehicle can't totally rock out in a civilian vehicle unless they have separate training.  If we were talking prereqs or something, maybe, but separate and equal?                        </div>

<p>Flight delayed.  Ten minutes to kill.</p>
<p>The difference between the civillian vehicles and the military vehicles will be weapons &amp; armor.  Mostly.  But not really.  The real distinction is that everyone can tell the difference between a military vehicle and a civvy vehicle by looking at it.  That discussion really needs to wait for my next post so I can talk about Toys properly.</p>
<p>Once again, I'm not quite sure what you guys are barking at with the vehicles split.  I thought I was clear on this already.  Lemmie try one more time.  Acrobatics &amp; Athletics, Civvy Vehicles, and Mil Vehicles are chase skills, right?  They're about getting someplace before someone else, or keeping someone from getting away, right?  Chase or race.  The important difference between the three within that category is their level of subtlety.  Chasing someone on foot is generally noticed less than would be chasing someone at high speeds in a sports car.  And chasing someone in your tank or military heli is way more noticable, WAY less subtle than either of the other two.</p>
<p>More expensive to be the wheelman?  Well, that's just because you're creating a division that's unimportant in this game.  It's just as expensive to be the violent guy as it is to be the chase-guy.  And it's all the same price to catch people who are escaping on foot, who are escaping in a hopped-up mini, or who are tearing through the streets in an APC? Yes.</p>
<p>Does it matter what they are driving?  Yes, it does.  But that's a rule to talk about tomorrow.</p>

<i>The important difference between the three within that category is their level of subtlety.</i><br/><br/>Yeah, I get that--I just have a different concern that outweighs the justification you provide.  For me, qua potential player, the distinction between vehicles is intuitively small enough that I don't quite 'buy' a setting/game that makes me pay twice for what seems like identical skills.  Part of the problem is that I don't *just* see these skills as chase/race skills.  If that is *all* you plan to let them be, then it seems like you are undercutting the cool, creative flexibility that led you to exclude stealth as a skill.  <br/><br/>Given the freedom you ascribed to the stealthiness issue, I can &amp; would use any or all of them to be sneaky (tailing in a car, pulling up the tank to a concealed location, running along the rooftops so the guy below you never even sees you), to deal with particular sorts of obstacles (hopping the wall, driving through buildings, running over someone), and so on.  <br/><br/>With that in mind, I don't see why I should have one skill to run a guy over with a tank and another to run him over with a ferrari; one skill to fly my F-15 between two buildings and another to do the same with a small two-seater civilian plane.  Sure, different vehicles would be better for different jobs, but that seems a property of the vehicle rather than the operator--a distinction you do seem to want to retain.<br/><br/>I'll let it go, because it seems like you are pretty happy with the division and it's a relatively small problem.  And perhaps it will click when I see how 'toys' work.                        </div>

Indeed we should.  The only downside I can see to a game about photocopy repairmen is pitching it to new players.  "It's awesome.  You repair ... photocopiers!"  Or real estate salesmen.  We need some Arthur Miller up in this joint.<br/>
<br/>
Josh,<br/>

On the one hand I guess I see what you're saying.  But I love the idea of tricking out my Cyborg Commando and then tromping him through the delicacies of his personal life.  "Honey, could you mow the lawn?"  "Sure.  I'm rolling Military Vehicles."  Very bull-in-china-shop.  Although, I guess that's sort of the idea with MLwM, too, it's just that your character's maladaptions stem from different sources.                        </div>

<p>Bring your photocopy repairmen to their own damned thread!  <em>friendly return kick-in-the-balls</em></p>

<p><code>Because I want to do all three and think chases are boring.</code></p>
<p>All three examples are awesome, Jason.  You just happen to be completly wrong for thinking that chases are boring.  At what point did I say that these three things couldn't be done?  When I said that the three skills are my 'chase' skills?  Ok, that's fine.  Lemmie back off of those categories.  They only matter because that's what I had in my head when I authored the skills.  Now, they don't matter all that much.  They'll point to not only what I originally designed them for, but for buckets and buckets of other awesomeness.</p>
<p>Judson,</p>
<p><em>Everything</em> you mention in that paragraph, the aliens, dealing with fitting in, the whole fucking she-bang, it's all in there.  The Missions are pretty integral to this design, so maybe this game just isn't for you.  But the reason why I put them in there was for the contrast.  Lemmie say that again;  The Contrast.  The contrast between being a killing machine bent on saving humanity and being a human being who needs love and affection.  Both things are cool.  I know plenty of games that do one or the other.  This one will do both, and make you hold them up in comparison against each other.  Every session.  All the time.  Every time.</p>
<p>If the killing-machine James Bond stuff isn't your bag, I can totally dig that.  But please understand that under no circumstances will that stuff be taken out of this design.</p>
<p>Ian,</p>
<p>Ok.  So, now I know that you know that I know that you know that you understand what I was getting at.  Awesome.  And knowing that, I can see that your issue is isolated and seperate from what I was talking about.  Zoomy.</p>
<p>Now, I see plenty of room to try to argue at you about how the difference between civvy vehicles and military vehicles is <em>tremendous</em>, but I don't think it would be too fun or productive for either of us.  So, let's go in a fun &amp; productive direction with this.  You know my goals; Three skills that are about getting from place to place and point in the general direction of chase-scenes.  What other direction would you suggest taking the skills?  I'm so happy with those three skills right now that I'm having trouble coming up with different ideas.  They make such a nice &amp; neat parallel to my three violence skills that I'm having trouble even considering breaking up the set.</p>
<p>So, have you got any ideas?  'Cuz my fingers are itching to do the not-productive-thing and tell you all about how the division is killer the way it is.</p>
<p>-Eric</p>
<p>ps-</p>
<p>Mark,</p>
<p>I'm just lazy.  Making the opening bill as "An elite team of cyborgs." is so much easier than "An elite team of people who are probably cyborgs, and if they don't start as cyborgs, there's an excellent chance that they will end up as cyborgs long before the story is complete, eventually causing them a tragic disassociation from the whole of society."</p>

                            Hmm... How's this look?<br/>
<br/>
[Subtle / Obvious / Blatant]<br/>
<br/>
Maneuver: Atheletics / Civvy Vehicles / Military Vehicles<br/>
Combat:  Martial Arts / Small Arms / Heavy Weapons<br/>
Manipulate:  Decieve / Impress / Command<br/>
Investigate:  Technician / Hacking / B&amp;E<br/>
<br/>
I realize 'Technician' doesn't fit in quite as well, but  I think 'Technician' could easily be stretched to fit both 'Hm, these dents in the sidewalk were clearly made by a 1.67 ton cyborg chassis' and 'I picked up these fingerprints from the window, and at first glance I don't think they're human'.  You could also shift 'Technician' to the Blatant category, depending on what you want it to mean.<br/>
<br/>
To me, this grid suggests all sorts of potential system stuff.  For instance, you could have scenes broken down by the type of skills which could be used.  <br/>
In a Pursuit scene only Maneuver skills would be relevant; you can shoot your guns if you want but it's all color until you win the Pursuit and it shifts to another type of scene.  Or better yet, give a stiff penalty to using any other skill but allow it anyway, thus solving the why-can't-I-use-Atheletics-to-clamber-up-the-drainpipe dilemma:  You can, but B&amp;E would be better for it.<br/>
<br/>
(Of course, any and all skills you can leverage are relevant while dealing with family matters.)<br/>
<br/>
You could also break each character's specialty down along those lines in the traditional 'pick one in each row/column to be great at, one to be good at, and one to be average at' way...  But I'm not sure how well that would work.<br/>

                            Just to storm in here, looking at Dave's chart and taking into consideration splitting Vehicle skills; I would propose this grid instead (and it pulls Stealth in too):<br/>
<br/>
Maneuver: Stealth / Acrobatics / Vehicles<br/>
Combat: Martial Arts / Small Arms / Heavy Weapons<br/>
Manipulate: Deceive / Impress / Command<br/>
Investigate: Technician / Hacking / B&amp;E<br/>
<br/>
"Stealth" (or "Sneak") being any movement where your objective <i>is to be subtle</i> (including potentially 'Athletics' actions like shimmying up a drainpipe or whatever). I'm also assuming Acrobatics is showy-parcour/Anime-inspired-styled stuff, rather than "normal" Athletics skills. Somersaulting from rooftop-to-rooftop, that kind of thing. And then anything to do with Vehicles is automatically blatant.<br/>
<br/>
I think that having this Stealth/Acrobatics/Vehicles split will also allow a wider range of colour to be added than the Athletics/Civvy Vehicles/Military Vehicles split.<br/>
<br/>
I also agree that Technician should cover detection type-things like Dave says above. You could, I think, change "Technician" to "Detect" or something for the subtle version (mixing in the old Investigate skill as well), and wrap the other uses of "Technician" into Hacking (messing about with software <i>&amp; electronics</i>) and maybe B&amp;E (messing about in a more 'physical' and/or obvious sense).<br/>

<p>Dave,</p>
<p>That's essentially the breakdown, for now.  But I have no intention of forcing particular types of scenes around those skills or categories.  Such a mechanism would be redundant.  I authored a skills list based off of the categories in an effort to make the categories bloom naturally into narration as a result of the flavor of the skills.</p>
<p>Warren,</p>
<p>There won't be any Stealth skill.  It's important to me.</p>
<p>All,</p>
<p>I've already designed a system and series of mechanisms to support the skills.  There are only three kinds of scenes;  Personal, Mission, and Mission Climax.  I'm married to it and have zero intention of budging on it right now.  At least not in relation to discussing what the skills could or couldn't do.  Lemmie finish brushing my teeth and I'll try to get back soon to discuss all this.</p>

Ground-Water vs. Air is tolerable, but something like Standard vs. Exotic is maybe cooler--yeah, Standard guy can drive a tank, pilot a plane or ship, but Exotic guy knows how to use cool giant robots and jet packs.  <br><br>It seems a little more amenable to my mind to parallel that with small arms and heavy weapons, too.  <br><br>As an aside, I see all sorts of ways where I would build my character without a lot of focus on the triads--is that an explicit strucutral element that will direct character generation or just a design tool?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

<p>Whew!  I was having some serious troubles with my connection here.  My captain finally came to my rescue and loaned me his cable so I could hook directly to the modem here.  What a mess.</p>
<p>Ok Ian, I think we may actually be on the same page.  Note that no where in my posts did I confirm Jason's statements that the skills are <em>just</em> color.  They are color... and many other things.  The subtlety thing is mechanically reinforced through Toys.  I've got this post that I constructed while offline, and I was going to make a new thread for it, but now I realize that's kinda silly.  Lemmie just post it under this one.</p>

<p>[cut &amp; paste-zored!]</p>
<p>I want to give everyone who's helping me out with the skills portion of Invisible Shepherds an idea of how those skills are already connected to the rest of the system.  I spent some time considering just posting up the rag-tag playtest document I have, but decide that I'd end up just confusing the issue.  My early playtest documents are always written in what my wife likes to call Eric-speak.  So, instead of sharing that confusion around, I'm going to give you a thumbnail of how the mechanisms hang together.</p>
<h4>Toys</h4>
<p>The skills are directly connected to Toys.  Weapons, vehicles, toolkits, cyberware.  The text will contain short "shopping-lists" of each type of toy, and each toy will have it's own special effects, bonus to skill roll, and a chance that using it will cause the Shepherds to fuck up their public relations.  Come right down to it, each toy will have it's special effects listed in a paragraph or two and a single numeric rating between 1 and 8.  That rating is the number of dice that it adds to a skill roll when you use the item.</p>
<p>Each skill will be tied to a specific range of dice that are available to toys that might be tied to that skill.  Right this minute that scale kinda works like this; Low 1-3 dice, Medium 3-5 dice, and High 5-8 dice.  For example, the three skills of Martial Arts, Side-arms, and Heavy Weapons have scales of Low, Medium, and High, respectively.  So, melee weapons will have between 1 and 3 dice, side-arms will have between 3 and 5 dice, and the heavy shit will have between 5 and 8 dice.</p>
<h4>Public Opinion</h4>
<p>When a Shepherd uses excess force in a conflict there's a chance that public opinion will sway against them.  When public opinion about a shadowy force of cyborgs goes south, it causes personal problems for the Shepherds.  In a nutshell, when you use more toy-dice than your opponent does, then public opinion sways against you.  The bigger the difference between the toys you use and the toys your opposition uses the more sway in public opinion.  The more the sway in public opinion, the less likely you are to win personal conflicts.</p>
<p>It's way more complex in effect than that, but that's the important part for now.</p>
<h4>Scene Types</h4>
<p>What kind of scene it is does not directly relate to what kind of skills might be in play.  There is an indirect relationship, but please don't assume that one particular skill is only for one kind of scene or vice-versa.</p>
<p>The three different kinds of scenes are Personal, Mission, and Mission Climax.  The three types are pretty informal and I expect that they'll naturally blend together more often than not.  I imagine that it wouldn't be hard at all for a scene to blend from personal to mission, onto the Mission Climax, and back to personal before it ends.  Now, the type of scene has to do with the type of conflict that's going on and that's a little less formal.  There are formal mechanisms for addressing your character's personal issues, for advancing the mission towards it's conclusion, and for eventually resolving the success or failure of the mission.  If you've read the other Shepherds thread, the Teeth that Specialist-players author are the meat &amp; potatoes of both the Mission and Mission Climax scenes.  Those Teeth might determine that a particular skill needs to be used for some part of the mission.  But that part of the system isn't 100% built yet.  I have work yet to do there.</p>
<p>Now, I've written most of this up without the benefit of looking over all the questions and comments on the Skills thread.  The connection in my hotel room is pretty well shot, so I'm doodling all this up on Notepad before heading down to the lobby to get a more steady connection.  I hope I haven't missed anything vital.  If so, I'll amend this with another post.</p>
<p>-Eric</p>

<p>Not true.  The speculation and commentary on the skills list alone, with no connection to the rest of the rules, led to not only my minor changes in the list, but my refined ability to articulate what that list is supposed to be about has had an effect on how I anticipate finishing off the Teeth rules.</p>
<p>There's plenty of productivity here.  If it's too frustrating for you to speculate any further 'till I get what I have online, I totally respect that.  However, I'd like to point out that these unhinged bits of speculation are powerful motivators and strong bits of inspiration for me to get on to finishing that document.  And to finishing it in a much more refined form than I could without the speculation.</p>

                            bq. Everything you mention in that paragraph, the aliens, dealing with fitting in, the whole fucking she-bang, it's all in there. The Missions are pretty integral to this design, so maybe this game just isn't for you.<br/>
<br/>
Eric, <br/>
<br/>
Allow me to commend you on having a clear fucking vision.  Thank you for letting me know that my idle musings about a _different game_ that would be related to your concept will have no impact on your design.  Because that would suck if I had to watch my god damned mouth.<br/>
<br/>
That said (and suddenly wondering why you Will Not Have a Stealth Skill), can I propose a couple of name changes:<br/>
<br/>
Technician - as an investigation skill, is this not more like Forensics?  Or Sexy Trivia?  Also, this is the only skill that's named after a profession rather than an activity.<br/>
<br/>
Civilian Vehicles - I think some of the oddness here also comes from the fact that every other skill heightens your otherness, where as this one reads more mundane.  "Tactical Driving?":http://www.blackwaterusa.com/training/track.asp<br/>
<br/>
Athletics &amp; Acrobatics - As a primarily chase skill, maybe something like Ground Pursuit makes more sense.                        </div>

<p>Ian,</p>
<p>You know, I'd spent some time waffling back and forth on that question.  I'm certain that the system wouldn't break one way or another.  Right now I'm leaning towards no.  See, the rating of each toy has an effect on the possible public opinion backlash, and if someone you were chatting with was using a Toy to Command you to do something it would reduce the backlash you'd receive if you were to respond by shooting them in the head with a bazooka.  So, any Toys in that category would have to be a bit <em>evil</em> to maintain the believability* of the system.</p>
<p>*(What's that v-word I'm trying to think of?)</p>
<p>Judson,</p>
<p>Funny, I seem to have gone and mistaken your idle musings for an indirect question followed by a disparaging "ho-hum" comment about my design choices.  My bad.</p>
<p>I intended the Technician skill to be about fixing ,breaking, and jury-rigging.  No forensics.  After some clear thought, I've realized that I don't want there to be much, if any, clue-finding-flavored investigation in this game.  That's why I scratched out the Investigation skill a few posts back.  Those type of scenes just don't have a place here.</p>
<p>That's an interesting thought on Civvy Vehicles, the bit about not hightening your "otherness".  Problem is, I just don't agree with your assessment.  I can't think of anything more human than Impress, Command, and Deceive.  Seems to me like that stuff happens an awful lot more every day than driving to work and back.</p>
<p>The problem with Ground Pursuit, and the reason why I haven't discarded the extra-long "Acrobatics &amp; Athletics" title is in the implication and inspiration that the skill title provides to the player.  I don't imagine Ground Pursuit inspiring me to narrate much of anything interesting, while Acrobatics &amp; Athletics inspires me to narrate crazy flips and jumping over obstacles that are in my way.</p>

Is there any way to take a big hit in the combat monster department for a big payoff in the personal department?  Basically, can I 'go a little soft' so that I get love but may be just a little less likely to mow down the baddies?<br/>
<br/>
An idea for toy influencing personal interactions: what about implanting my neighbor with a chip so I can 'hack' him friendly?  Maybe B&amp;E then Hack?  In that case, I could lose access to bigger toys in the combat monster part ("Damn it, there you go again, using our tech for personal reasons--see if we give you a tank on the next mission...")                        </div>

<p>Hell yeah.  It's about the Toys you use (or are forced to use) in a mission.  And, as particular skills are tied to particular levels of toys, then it's also about the type of skill you choose to use.  If you choose to go all subtle into the mission then you've got a greater chance of failure on the mission, but fewer reprocussions in the Public Opinion arena, thus indirectly bumping up the love-thang.</p>
<p>Which is (I hope) going to be totally awesome.  It's a quiet little way of choosing to remain human at the cost of the world.  I hope.</p>
<p><code>An idea for toy influencing personal interactions: what about implanting my neighbor with a chip so I can 'hack' him friendly?</code></p>
<p>Hmm... My initial gut reaction is that I don't care for it.  But, as I can't articulate <em>why</em> I don't like it yet, I'll have to mull it over some.</p>

<i>It's about the Toys you use (or are forced to use) in a mission.</i><br/><br/>Ok...I have some concern (not sure how entirely justified, might be something to attend to in a playtest) that this might make the 'human' scenes a little less interesting.  The player will basically have made all their big choices already in the combat scenes and, more or less, be playing out their consequences.<br/><br/>Add to that, when I go into combat, I'm doing all kinds of things--selecting toys, thinking about consequences, and so on, in *addition* to using skills to do stuff, but when I go into a 'living my life' scene, I'm just using skills to do stuff and importing any penalties accrued from combat choices.<br/><br/>Again, that isn't bad, it just means that the game's question is "these guys make all their choices on the battlefield, but can they live with them afterwards?" rather than "How do their choices on the battlefield impact their life?

<p><code>The player will basically have made all their big choices already in the combat scenes and, more or less, be playing out their consequences.</code></p>
<p>Lemmie see if I can alleviate that concern with a little more detailed of an example.  Let's say that you and I are playing.  In the interest of keeping the Wolf-alien from throwing a sack full of kittens into the river, you run his ass over with your tank.  He was armed with kittens, you with a tank.  I was playing the Wolf and since you way out-gunned me and won the conflict, I gets me a stack of Public Opinion points that I can use for later.</p>
<p>The rules allow me to use those PO points for <em>any</em> conflict where I'm playing a Sheep (if the character isn't a Wolf or a Shepherd, it's a Sheep).  That would allow me to use those points in a later conflict.  And I want to point out that these points are just one of many other resources I can use to win my Sheep-y conflicts.</p>
<p>So, I could use them while taking the side of yer mum as you're trying to convince her that you're not really racist ("But I heard that you ran over that nice Chinese man with the kitten with a tank today!"), or I could use them in a conflict over trying to keep your girlfriend from breaking up with you ("...your mind is reeling over earlier events and you're having trouble focusing on what she has to say...").  Or I could even use them for a conflict that doesn't even involve your character at all, like when the Prime Minister revokes the Director's budget proposal, citing innapropriate use of resources.</p>
<p>So, here's the thing, right...  You <em>might</em> have saved those kittens without the tank.  Maybe.  But using the tank pretty well guaranteed a no-kitten-death resolution to the conflict.  And giving me those PO points doesn't guarantee that I'll win any of my Sheep-sided-conflicts.  It just gives me a little more oomph to turn the tide against my fellow Shepherds.  You did make a big desicision in using the tank, but it's certainly not like it's the last decision you'll make about your character's personal life.  Heck, I see plenty of room in this system for you to follow up the Tank v. Kittens scene with a scene where you try to sucker me into dropping my PO points into a conflict that you really don't mind loosing.  Or even a conflict where you might <em>want</em> to loose.</p>
<p><code>Again, that isn't bad, it just means that the game's question is "these guys make all their choices on the battlefield, but can they live with them afterwards?" rather than "How do their choices on the battlefield impact their life? Can they find enough solace at home to continue struggling?"</code></p>
<p>Both of those are pretty close to what I'm aiming for here, but neither is exactly it.  What I'm going for is more of "Will you choose to be a hero or a human?".  I expect some players will go for one or the other, some players won't notice that there's a choice to be made untill they make it, and some will intentionally shoot for something intentionally tragedy-laden.</p>
<p><code>If they royally f*** up their home life, are there any consequences for the fighting?</code></p>
<p>Nope.  Should there be?</p>

Yes, that's great!  It alleviates my biggest concern with how the choices of toys would play out later in the game.  I had in mind something quite different--one of the dangers of working in that partial rules seen mode.  <br/>
<br/>
It does raise some others:<br/>
<br/>
1.  It sounds like all PO points go into one big pile and the GM pulls them out as wanted.  So, I imagine me doing my darndest to limit my toy use while by bud goes all crazy with the tanks, guns, plasma cannons (allowing you, GM, to accumulate gobs of PO).  Cut to my home scene--I did my best to be a human, but you, the GM, have shitloads of PO points to drill the crap out of me in my human scenes.  So, not only am I not a hero, but I get a suck ass life, to boot.  Sure, my bud has a crappy life, but he already expected that--he just wants to be a hero.<br/>
<br/>
(there is a versimilitude to that problem--guilt by association--but it might not be fun to play out...it could encourage and facilitate munchkin play--a sort of "I have 6 Cha but a 20 Strength, woot!")<br/>
<br/>
which is why:<br/>
<br/>
2. It would be cool if there are choices I could make as a human that would insulate me from the PO fallout, esp. when I wasn't trying to accumulate it.  Even if it were just anti-PO points that would negate GM PO.  And PO is just so close to BO that I want to call them deoderant points... ; )<br/>
<br/>
On a more serious note, that could allow the most human guy to be a 'front man' for the group, the shining, smiling face that the public loves to trust, even if his buds nuke the local KMart.  "Am I a hero? Nah, but gosh darn it, people like me, and isn't that what really matters?"                        </div>

<p>That's a legit concern.  Here's how I imagine it playing out.</p>
<p>First, and I know you didn't know this yet, but there's no GM in this game.  Sometimes I'll play the wolf and sometimes you'll play the wolf.  There's some structure to who play who and when, but the important part for this issue is that each player has as much opportunity to gain PO points as any other.  So it's not one great big pool of PO, it's several.</p>
<p>So now, let's say that it's you, me, and Jason playing.  In one scene I go all out with the Tank v. Kittens scenario while Jason's playing the Wolf.  Jason earns a stack o' PO points for my overzealousness.  In a later scene you're in a conflict where your trying to have your Shepherd convince mom of something and Jason's playing your Shepherd's mom.  Further, Jason goes and dumps all those freshly earned PO points into having your mom slap you down.  Cold.</p>
<p>Now, the situation we have after yer mum slaps you down is that my character's overzealousness done fucked with your character's mom-kid relation.  Assuming that Jason narrated no fictional story-line connection between the Tank v. Kitten scene and the Mom v. Shepherd scene, that connection will still totally be in your brain, yes?</p>
<p>Soooo... what I'm imagining, and what there's no mechanical enforcement for what-so-ever, is that when my character goes and fucks things up for the whole team (your character included) by being over zealous, then the reprocussions I will almost certainly see will be either finding myself at a loss in my personal life <em>or</em> possibly suddenly finding myself on the cold end of a shoulder from all my Shepherd-partners.  Because, after you get whomped in the Mom v. You scene, you're gonna be looking for a bit of revenge, yes?  Who are ya gonna take it out on?  Me, I assume.  Maybe you have your character confront mine about his Tank-loving ways.  Maybe you sit quiet and earn up all the PO points you can, not to fuck with my character's personal life, but to help out those non-Wolf characters that still form a majority of our opposition during missions.</p>
<p>Or maybe you just lean over to Jason and call him a monkey-cock for spending those points on you when it's so obvious that I need to be taken down a peg.</p>
<p>So, come right down to it, I think the unfairness of it all is quite awesome.  If the roles were reversed and it were your character's overzealousness that was making mom hate me, I'd see nothing but awesome opportunity.   I mean, it not that either of us are getting shut out of the game as players, it just means that your character gets to be all shiney and explosive and shit, and I get to make my character the brooding outcast.  So, I don't think having the ability to insulate yourself from someone else's problems would be good at all.</p>
<p>Do you still think so?</p>

Yeah.  Very much like the Roach.  There's strong Roach and Grey Ranks influence here, if only because I see Jason as the go-to guy for GM-less RPGs.<br/>

<i>So, I don't think having the ability to insulate yourself from someone else's problems would be good at all. <br/><br/>Do you still think so?</i><br/><br/>Hmmm...ok, well that's interesting.  So how does framing a scene correspond with getting PO?  Can only the person framing the scene get PO?  Can only the person framing the scene spend PO?<br/><br/>In Roach the dog-eat-dog framing style works so well because, in part, the setting is exactly that.  You want everyone to have it out for the other players' characters to <b>suffer</b>.  It seems a little out of place here.  Although, that said, I like the idea that you can't shield yourself from other people's problems....hmmm.                        </div>

<p>Don't try to compare the Roach and this game too much.  They are very much two different entities.  The only similarity I meant to point out was the meta-structure of who's turn it is and who gets involved in the scene as which character.</p>
<p><code>So how does framing a scene correspond with getting PO?</code></p>
<p>My first reaction was to say "It doesn't!", but that's totally untrue.  There just happens to be a somewhat indirect relationship.</p>
<p>Ok, so let's talk about that scene-framing structure and how I'm imagining it happening in this system.  There's informal turns, right?  And on your turn you get to frame up a scene and propose a conflict.  And as your're doing that you get to insist that particular players have to take part in the scene.  You can't block any player from being in the scene, and I don't <em>think</em> you should be able to dictate what character or characters they represent in that scene.  I <em>think</em> you can dictate at least one player who has to oppose you in your scene/conflict, but I haven't quite ironed that bit out.  I'm pretty sure there won't be anything to dictate wether or not you play a Shepherd, a Sheep, or a Wolf on your turn, but I am pretty certain that other players' Shepherds are off-limits for you to play.</p>
<p>Lots o' "if" and "think"-shit in there still, but I imagine it'll all iron out shortly.</p>
<p>Now, you earn PO points when you are playing a non-Shepherd character in a conflict where you loose AND the opposing side is a Shepherd AND used more Toy dice than you.  In an easier nutshell; When a Shepherd goes Tank v. Kitten, the kitten-player earns points.</p>
<p>You may spend PO points any time you're playing a Sheep character in a conflict.  Period.</p>
<p>Neither earning nor spending is directly tied to who framed the scene, unless the scene framer gets the authority to dictate what type of character you play.  Which I don't think will happen.  So, that was a long way to go to say; Probably not.</p>

<i>Don't try to compare the Roach and this game too much. They are very much two different entities.</i><br/><br/>Fair enough, but I think the comparison I did make is relatively sound, esp. given the quasi-example of play you provided.  This game, like roach, will foster some degree of competitiveness in-game.  <br/><br/>Which means that you get a situations where it isn't *really* a question of whether *my* choices make me a hero or a human.  Those sorts of things can easily get made for me.  Sure, I can choose to play 'more' humane but its starting to sound like all that means is I don't get to play with the cool toys, not that I get anything *for* (some benefit I can use elsewhere) that choice--because PO points accumulated by somebody else's choice can be used to smack me down in the human place.  I can't really make myself strong there, only not make someone else as strong when that appears.<br/><br/>Since we all probably have some PO, I can get back at the guy who screws me--but that doesn't quite live up to the thematic "Are you a man or a machine?" and ends up being "Man or machine, we all get it in the end."  And at least machines get to go out in a blaze of glory.<br/><br/>What's my motivation for framing a scene without Shepherds?  Is it just for color?  Or are there choices that non-Shepherds make which can profoundly impact the game?  Could I frame a no-Shepherd scene as a way to dump my PO tokens into a conflict that profoundly impacts a Shepherd or the Wolf?<br/><br/>I'm thinking: I frame a scene, involving another Shepherd's mother.  I dump an assload of tokens into it and have her killed.  Take that, Mr. Human--what do you do now that you ain't got nothing to live for?  Can I do that?  I kind of like that from a play perspective, but it could cause some problems. <br/><br/>Could I frame a non-shepherd scene and dump tokens into them so that I can nuke the Wolf using non-Shepherds pumped up by PO?  Or could I frame a scene that gives the Wolf a creepy alien 'mommy' it has to try and please and make its life, hell, too?  Again, that isn't necessarily bad, but it does jar with the stated goal of this being 'about' the Shepherds and their struggles.                        </div>

<p>Very true.  Point taken.</p>
<p>I want to come back to the PO point thing and the theme it creates, but I'm quickly running out of time on this break.  If I don't poke back in here in a day or two it's just because my schedule is about to get hectic for the next couple of days.  I'll post back as soon as possible.</p>
<p>To quickly talk about the non-Shepherds scenes, I just want to say that there is no mechanical motivator for doing so, and I think that there will be enough motivators to want your Shepherds in the conflicts to keep those non-Shepherd scenes to a minimum.  But I could be wrong.  I'll dig into that issue with you more when I get back.</p>

<p>Alrighty.  Took me a bit longer than I'd anticipated to get back here.  I've been pondering the owning yer own PO points thing.  I really liked the idea that one Shepherd could get screwed over for the excesses of another.  I imagine that it would have sponsored a sense of teamwork.  But I totally see what you're getting at here, Ian.  Not only that, but I agree about where the mechanism would take the game, and I don't like it.  So, I've come up with a variant on the mechanism where PO points you earn end up in front of you.  Other players spend your points to buy dice when you're playing a Shepherd and they're playing a Sheep.</p>
<p>Now, how this relates to no-Shepherd scenes.  Well, you can only get PO points when you're playing a Shepherd and you can only spend them when someone else is.  So, a no-Shepherd scene is also a no PO point scene.</p>
<p><code>I...have her killed. Take that, Mr. Human--what do you do now that you ain't got nothing to live for? Can I do that? I kind of like that from a play perspective, but it could cause some problems.</code></p>
<p>I like it too.  And yeah, it could totally cause problems.  But I think those problems are problems that I'll be able to get around with some good guidelines.  See, your Shepherd PC won't have an investment with his mother, he'll have an investment with an <em>issue</em> or three with his mother.  Take mom out of the picture and the issue may or may not be blocked.  Now, when the issue is blocked by you murdering the central figure, all I think needs to be included in the system is a way to re-invest.</p>
<p>For example, I start with an issue about looking for my mom's forgiveness.  She's killed, and I don't see any way to continue addressing the forgiveness issue, so I re-invest in an issue about... oh... forgiving my mother's killer?  Yeah.  Something like that.</p>
<p>Now, about using PO to kill the Wolf.  Well, with the new rule, can't do it.  Or rather, it'd be totally crazy-unlikely.  You'd have to be playing a Sheep and there'd have to be a Shepherd <em>and</em> the Wolf on the opposing side.  Which would probably end up being kinda cool.  Cuz, what kind of scene would bring the Shepherd and the Wolf together against a common Sheep opponent?  A cool one, that's what.</p>
<p>I really don't imagine the no-Shepherd scene coming up all that much.  I can't offer any good explination why not, just gut feeling right now.</p>

She's killed, and I don't see any way to continue addressing the forgiveness issue, so I re-invest in an issue about... oh... forgiving my mother's killer?</i><br/><br/>This is cool and sounds like it could allow for dynamic 'human' character play--"sure I lost this attachment, but I'm not giving up, I'm going to..."  It also allows me to be more than just a tragically mopey guy who wishes his life would go better.  I can really struggle, keep trying to live up to my ideal of humanity.<br/><br/>Personally, I still think it would be cool if there were ways to get something fed from the human encounters back into my military encounters.  I'm thinking something along the lines of: "Mom's dead, killed by fanatical associates of the very Wolf I was trying to stop, yet somehow I found it in myself to keep going, to forgive the man who killed her as a misguided fanatic.  I am now ready to direct my attention to wiping the SOB wolf from the map..."<br/><br/>So I guess what I'm thinking can be clearly stated as this: Does it make sense for the characters to get bonus dice when they *resolve* one of their issues?  Not to get too psychoanalytic, but that they get the energy invested in the issue back once they deal with it?                        </div>

<p><code>Personally, I still think it would be cool if there were ways to get something fed from the human encounters back into my military encounters.</code></p>
<p>There is a mechanism in the system that does this.  Mostly.  But, instead of giving you points when you resolve an issue, you get more and more points based on how tense your issues are.  Or rather, for how tense I think they'll be after being addressed after a certain number of sessions of play.</p>
<p>Each of your PC's issues has two ratings.  One of the ratings is the number of sessions that you've spent addressing that issue.  The higher this rating is, the more currency you get for putting dice anywhere.  Originally I was going to have this be a mission-only resource, but later decided that it'd be just fine if it was an any-scene resource.  The second rating for your issues is the maximum number of sessions you can address the issue before you have to resolve it.</p>
<p>Now, you don't actually get shit in the way of resources for resolving an issue, except for the opportunity to put your points from the Max-Rating into a new issue.  The first rating gets flushed when you resolve that particular issue, meaning that your total resources go down.  So really, you temporarily loose some resources when you resolve an issue.  Particularly one that you've been addressing for several sessions.  I'm hoping that this'll result in a more 'climatic' feeling for the issue, which should lead right into the build-up for the issue that replaces it.</p>
<p>Originally, I did have a reward for resolving an issue.  I dumped it when I realized that this would encourage players to take short-term issues over long-term and while lots of short-term issues won't nearly break the system, I don't want long-term issues to be a broken choice.</p>

                            Hi!<br/>
  OK, here is some questions:<br/>
1) How do players defend against these skills? If someone uses command on you, are you boned?<br/>
2) What's the deal with repair, demolitions, medical, resist torture/drugs, shadow/track, streetwise, survival and specialized knowledge like streetwise? I know that some of these we can assume that the chars are awesome at these, but I just wanted to put that out there...<br/>
3) As far as an awareness/investigate skill, you might want to think about that. How do the characters see through the conspiracy/disguise? Now, you may a different mechanic for that, but if there isn't, then the whole quiet conspiracy of conquest becomes a crap shoot, no?<br/>
  Seems like a cool idea! Don;t stop now man!<br/>

<p>Hiya Dave, thanks for the questions.</p>
<p><code>1) How do players defend against these skills? If someone uses command on you, are you boned?</code></p>
<p>In a word; Yes.  And no.  I suppose this is a good time to talk a little about the conflict resolution system.  Once a conflict comes up in a scene you'll be picking out the skill that you want to resolve it with and I'll pick out the skill that I want to resove it with.</p>
<p>For example; Let's say that you're playing a Shepherd who's trying to get into a secret research laboratory to liberate some research data.  Along the way you encounter a guard who levels his gun at you and orders you to stop and face the wall (that's my narration).  You respond by declaring that your character is gonna go all Aeon Flux on his ass with a couple jumps and flips.  So, right then and there, we've framed up our conflict.  You'll be rolling the Athletics &amp; Acrobatics on your character sheet and I'll be rolling Command from the NPC sheet.</p>
<p><em>Invisible Shepherds</em> uses a dice-pool system.  Sometimes you roll d6s, sometimes you roll d10s, sometimes you roll some of each.  Each die that comes up as 5 or better is a point and just one point is needed to be 'successful.'</p>
<p>So, let's say that you get more points than the guard does on the roll, but the guard gets at least one success.  You've won the roll and you get to narrate the final outcome and here are the guidelines for your narration:</p>
<ul>
<li>You win the stakes.  In this case, the stakes include getting away with that research data.</li>
<li>Your character did some awesome jumping around.  Make sure to include that.</li>
<li>Your character did succumb to the guard's command to stop &amp; put your arms in the air.  Had he rolled no 5's or better on any of his dice, then you wouldn't be bound to narrate in any reaction to his command.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, you could narrate something like how your character immediatley follows his command, stopping and arms in the air, and then jumping straight up to that water pipe hanging down from the ceiling to facilitate a gymnastic flip up into the open air shaft above, which leads directly into the laboratory you were looking for.  Or any other variation on the three bullet points.</p>
<p>There are variations on the rules that keep it from being that straightforward all the time, like being able to extend the conflict, what happens when you tie, and stuff like that.</p>
<p><code>2) What's the deal with repair, demolitions, medical, resist torture/drugs, shadow/track, streetwise, survival and specialized knowledge like streetwise? I know that some of these we can assume that the chars are awesome at these, but I just wanted to put that out there...</code></p>
<p>Some of those are covered under the existing skills and some don't need coverage at all.  Repair falls under Technician.  Demolitions falls under Heavy Weapons.   Shadow &amp; track are covered under Acrobatics &amp; Athletics, Civvy Vehicles, and Military Vehicles.  Medical, streetwise, survival, and specialized knowlege skills aren't included because I don't want to have any conflicts about them.  Either your character has them or he doesn't and it won't have any mechanical effect on conflicts.  Resist torture/drugs... well, I hadn't even considered a torture/drugging scene 'till just now.  Lemmie talk about defensive-type skills at the bottom of this post.</p>
<p><code>3) As far as an awareness/investigate skill, you might want to think about that. How do the characters see through the conspiracy/disguise? Now, you may a different mechanic for that, but if there isn't, then the whole quiet conspiracy of conquest becomes a crap shoot, no?</code></p>
<p>How do the chraracters see through the conspiracy?  Because they have to.  That's the story.  The characters are part of the one elite orginization in the world that knows what the Wolves are up to.  In fact, the characters are <em>part of</em> the conspiracy by trying to keep the general population from knowing that there's an invasion on.  No mechanisms needed.</p>
<h4>Defensive Skills</h4>
<p>One of the core reasons I decided to go with a skills list was to guide narration.  Players will narrate the coolest outcome that they can think of, as guided by their skills, right?  Like, when a player makes a really good Athletics &amp; Acrobatics roll they're gonna be inclined to narrate all sorts of crazy jumping and flipping about.  Or when a player makes a similarly good Civvy Vehicles roll they're likely to be inclined to narrate busting around corners and the squealing of tires.  Narration like that yeilds action.</p>
<p>But skills like Resist Torture and Stealth, defensive skills, really good rolls tend to get players to narrate how <em>nothing</em> happens.  Right?  Like; Ok, I'm being tortured.  I roll my Resist Torture skill and get a mega-good roll.  So, I narrate something like "I totally don't talk, I just spit in his eye."  Cool?  Yes.  But not as cool as responding to torture with shit like Command, Impress, or Deceive.</p>
<p>I think there are other reasons not to include defensive skills in a system like this, but what it comes right down to is that I really think we'll find better narration without them.</p>
<p><code>Seems like a cool idea! Don;t stop now man!</code></p>
<p>Thanks for the encouragement!  I'm trucking right along.  This weekend is gonna be pretty busy for me, but I'm hoping to have a draft of the rules that's worth reading up on my site by next weekend sometime.</p>

                            Hi!<br/>
  OK, I can dig the "no defensive skills" groove you got going, works for me.<br/>
  BUT, I think that there has to be some mechanical way to advance the plot. Otherwise, the GM has to spoon feed the clues and it feels too much like railroading. Or the GM has to come up with a mystery. And if the puzzle is too easy its no fun or if the puzzle is too hard its no fun. I've been in games where the GM is serving clues that they think are super obvious and no one at the table even knew they were clues.<br/>
  Now you might want to run it Mission Impossible style where the players are given a mission and some intel and they just have to figure out which intel is good or bad. But if the chars are more like independant troubleshooters, then there should be some rock solid guidelines about how to keep the conspiracy mysterious and nebulous, and still accessible and fun.<br/>
  Oh, and its just me, but I think it would be cooler if the aliens were called shepards...                        </div>

<p>Well, the whole plot thing has plenty of mechanisms.  It's kinda complex and deserving of a thread all it's own.  You'll see what I mean once I get my draft online.  And, as it turns out, a family emergency has one too many of my D&amp;D players out of town, so I'll have free time tomorrow to try &amp; maybe get that done this weekend.</p>
