<div class="Message">
                    Last night Mark, Judson, Jim, and I got together to give the chassis of Sons of Liberty a whirl.  Since the game works in some pretty odd ways (more on that later), I wanted to test out some mechanics at a much earlier stage than I might normally start kicking the tires.  The situation creation and the basic card mechanics were my primary concerns, and both got a thorough road test.<br/><br/>For context, <em>Sons of Liberty</em> is intended to be a pick-up-and-play game that can be whipped out at the drop of a hat.  It can be played in one session, requires no prep, and has pseudo-pregen characters.  The setting is familiar (the American Revolution) with the setting tweaks (clockworks, ornithopters, laser cannons) embedded in the rules so they get incorporated without having to read large chunks of setting material.  The premise, in short, is Americaâ€™s Founding Fathers kicking ass and taking names â€“ as literally as possible.  An early tagline for the game is, â€œIf you are playing Ben Franklin and you arenâ€™t clearing the cobblestone streets of redcoats by swinging an electrified kite over your head, youâ€™re playing it <em>wrong</em>.â€
<h3>Situation Creation</h3>
The first stage of the game â€“ before character creation and before picking the Tory Player (pseudo-but-not-really-GM) â€“ is to generate the situation for the current session.  Each session has three primary objectives and one secret objective.  Each is created by filling out a mad libs-like sentence by pulling words off of a chart, determined by card draws.  The format goes â€œThe Sons of Liberty must (verb) (object) in (location) (preposition) the British (verb) (object).â€  So you draw a 10 of Clubs and see that its verb is â€œimproveâ€ and then you draw a 6 of Spades and look up its object, â€œToriesâ€ and so on, until you get something like â€œThe Sons of Liberty must improve Tories before the British buy a good wife.â€<br/><br/>Because these randomly-generated objectives can get a little arcane, all the players portray the 33rd degree grand masters of the Sons of Liberty in this phase, calling on their expertise and connections to unravel the meaning and significance behind the objectives.  So a brief in-character dialogue later, the players could take the above and spin it out to, â€œWell, Iâ€™m from Virginia and I can tell you that the Tory mayor there has a wife whoâ€™s having an illicit affair.  He doesnâ€™t know, but the British do.  We intercepted some intelligence on this.  We believe theyâ€™re going to blackmail either him or his wife to ensure their loyalty.  Of course we canâ€™t let that happen.â€<br/><br/>You do this three times over to get three objectives for the session (the fourth secret objective comes in later).  Iâ€™ve also got a little webpage that can <a href="http://kallistipress.com/SoL/objectives.html" rel="nofollow">generate objectives on its own</a>.<br/><br/>So because this is, well, a little kooky, I was concerned it might not fly.  This bit worked marvelously, though, providing instant entertainment around the table, getting everybody in the madcap nature of the game, and creating a situation in less than ten minutes.  Players immediately got into narrating their â€œexpertiseâ€ by making stuff up on the fly, although I did sort of play moderator here, which should not be necessary; I want the thing to run itself through this stage.
<h3>Selecting Figures</h3>
After the objectives are determined, players pick Figures to play.  Now by the rules, everybody draws a card and goes in card order, highest to lowest, picking either a Patriot Figure to play or decides to become the Tory Player.  If it gets to the lowest card holder and thereâ€™s no Tory Player, they must be the Tory Player.  For playtesting purposes, I skipped that this time around and simply volunteered to play the Tories.  Mark selected the Marquis de Lafayette, Judson picked the Martin Women (two lady spies who masqueraded as men), and Jim grabbed Paul Revere.<br/><br/>Character generation also follows the mad libs theme.  Each Figure has two specialty suits and a list of favored circumstances.  The four suits correspond to four flavors of narration; hearts are patriotic, diamonds are station, clubs are clever, and spades are unorthodox.  Each Figure is grossly typed by which two suits are their specialties.  Favored circumstances are things like â€œwhen ridingâ€ or â€œin Congressâ€ or â€œwith George Washington.â€  The Patriot sheet is about eight lines long and explains the rules in shorthand, with blanks for slotting in suits and circumstances.<br/><br/>So the Marquis de Lafayette ended up looking like this:<br/>I am playing <strong>Marquis de Lafayette</strong>.<br/>I normally have a hand of four cards.<br/>I have a hand of five cards when <strong>evading pursuit</strong><br/>I can draw a new hand when <strong>being French</strong>.<br/>I can claim a joker when <strong>laughing in the face of danger</strong>.<br/>I can call for <strong>diamonds (station)</strong> when <strong>spending money</strong>.<br/>I can always play single <strong>spade (unorthodox)</strong> cards.<br/><br/>Iâ€™ll get to how all that <em>works</em> in a moment, but in terms of character generation, this went very fast and seemed to be very enjoyable for the players.  The mad libs format helped, I think, in letting the players â€œjust go with itâ€ rather than agonize over what to place where and contributed to the ongoing sort of cavalier attitude (which was awesome).<br/><br/>I, meanwhile, would normally select the Tory Figures that Iâ€™d be using, but those rules arenâ€™t finished yet.  I was a little concerned that this would be a problem for the playtest, but it didnâ€™t turn out to be that bad.  In fact since play hardly seemed to register the absence, I think the Tory Figures will be a lot shallower, rules-wise, than I might have otherwise made them.  All they really have to do is put a human face on the adversity.                </div>

<h3>In the Field</h3>
With our Figures selected and customized, we were set to start play and tackle my other big concern: the core mechanics.  In short form, the Patriot players play cooperative <a href="denied:â€http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rummyâ€" rel="nofollow">rummy</a> with each other while the Tory player follows his own rules (more later).  The Patriots play willy-nilly without turns, and must accompany card plays with appropriately flavored narration.  So if you play a heart, you need to do something patriotic.  The suits and circumstances on their character sheets give them special rules or ways to break the basic rummy rules (like having a larger hand, or playing single cards instead of melds).  The players can also play off of each otherâ€™s cards, splitting up each othersâ€™ melds to liberate that one card in the middle they need and so on.  The idea is that theyâ€™re all working together to get as many cards down on the table.  At the end of the scene, the number of cards on the table (not counting the singles) is the Patriot score.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Tory player has a hand of cards equal to the number of Patriot players (so I had three).  The Tory player may play a card when he violates the Bill of Rights amendment that corresponds to the cardâ€™s rank.  So you play a two to disarm colonists (Second Amendment being the right to bear arms).  After you play a card, you draw one to replace it.  Face cards are not played, because youâ€™re trying to collect them.  If you can get three face cards, you can end the scene.  The Tory score is the total of the cardsâ€™ ranks, with face cards counting as 11.<br/><br/>All of which is a highly compressed version of the rules, so I hope I made sense, there.  In any case, when the scene ends (by the Patriots moving and seconding a scene end or the Tory player collecting at least three face cards), the Patriot score is compared to the Tory score and the highest score gets their stakes.  Everybody narrates a little bit of the scene wrap up, with the Patriots going in order of the highest card left in their hand and the Tory player going last if he won or first if he lost.  Whoever has the lowest card in their hand frames the next scene and sets the sceneâ€™s stakes.<br/><br/>Which is all more than a little kooky as far as game mechanics go.  On the whole, the scheme worked.  The first couple scenes were a little shaky as the players figured out what â€˜countedâ€™ as a heart or club or what-have-you, and how to leverage their favored circumstances to help get cards onto the table.  I believe Jim suggested putting what each suit counts for onto the character sheet along with â€œnormally I have four cards,â€ which I will most assuredly be doing.<br/><br/>I was a little concerned that some of the special abilities would vastly overpower others: that maybe having five cards instead of four was way more useful than getting a joker.  We didnâ€™t see any evidence of this, and in fact saw the beginnings of a couple different strategies (and multiple valid strategies is good), so at least at this stage, all things look relatively balanced.  The book is not closed on this one, though, and Iâ€™ll be hawk-eyeing later sessions for glitches.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised that the Tory rules were both challenging and prompted me in new and interesting ways.  At a number of points I was thinking to myself, â€œWell, I can violate due process or I can break up an assembly of colonists... letâ€™s see....â€  The decisions were difficult but not too much, and the players later commented that they couldnâ€™t â€œjust play cards wheneverâ€ like I could, so it appears that the process looks clean from the other side of the table.<br/><br/>We did find that the more aggressive the initial scene frame, the better the resulting scene.  Like, a <em>lot</em>, and way more than most games.  I started us off with what I thought was an aggressive frame, with the Patriots walking into the mayorâ€™s ball with British all around them, and it didnâ€™t really fire.  The best scene in the game was when Judson said something to the effect of, â€œWe get the wifeâ€™s lover to get her to arrive for a secret rendezvous, then kidnap her and storm the mayorâ€™s mansion.  Scene starts as we step onto the grounds.â€  We skipped all that wife-kidnapping bit and were the better for it.  So thereâ€™s aggressive, and then thereâ€™s <em>aggressive</em>, and the latter worked a lot better than the former.<br/><br/>The rules-as-written have the first scene always being about sneaking in unnoticed or gathering information, and I think Iâ€™m going to ditch that, since it tends to put a damper on the high-action craziness that the gameâ€™s supposed to foster.  The opening options should be more along the lines of (a) beginning in media res in a big melee, (b) a chase scene, or (c) explosions of some variety.  Judson also suggested that players frame the next scene after they get their initial hand for that scene, so they can plan a little better how to frame, and this sounds like a fantastic idea.                        </div>

<h3>Swapping Tory Player and Circumstances</h3>
We only played through one objective.  In the after-game recap, I was a little surprised to find that the players were interested in swapping out the Tory player role between objectives (instead of at the end of the three-objective session).  They were also curious how they could swap out circumstances for something else â€“ either because what they had wasnâ€™t working for them or because they wanted to try something else.<br/><br/>My thinking in designing the game was that every session would have a different Tory player and each session the Patriot players would select and customize their Figures anew.  So if I played John Adams last time, I could play Ben Franklin the next.  Or, if I really wanted to keep playing John Adams, I could play him with an entirely different set of favored circumstances.  That was odd enough for me, but apparently the crew wants even faster turnover of PCs and pseudo-GM.  Iâ€™m still not sure what to think of this.
<h3>Valor and Inter-scene Structure</h3>
The biggest hole in the design â€“ presently patched with placeholder rules â€“ is the bigger picture of how the individual scenes work together, how they link up, and what relationship they have to each other.  The question being, assuming the goal is to fulfill all three objectives, whatâ€™s stopping the players from simply playing three scenes, the stakes of each is one of the objectives?  The present answer is Valor, which either needs to be upgraded or replaced.<br/><br/>The current rules go like this: in a scene that doesnâ€™t have Objectives at stake, the winner of the scene gets Valor points (we used little tokens).  Patriots get one each; Tory player gets one per Patriot player, depending on which side won.  In later scenes, Patriots can spend a Valor to â€œStick It to the Manâ€ by taking any meld on the table, shuffling it, and forcing the Tory player to trade one of his cards for one of the meld cards.  The rest of the meld is discarded.  The Tory player can spend Valor to draw a new card and decide whether or not to swap it into his hand, discarding as he does so.  These are very rough placeholder rules, although I have a real fondness for the Stick It rule.  I know as the Tory player I lived in fear of having the Patriots Stick It to me before I got my third face card.  On the other hand, I never spent my own Valor.<br/><br/>In any case, Valor is a moderately useful commodity, and so players have a reason for framing non-Objective scenes.  However, as useful as Valor is, itâ€™s not necessary, and the Patriots can still rush right to the Objective without much fear.<br/><br/>Now, if I keep Valor in the game, it seems to me it should have some more uses, but I donâ€™t want to belabor the game with too many rules or things to keep track of.  â€œIâ€™ve got cards and circumstances and I play off everybody elseâ€™s cards, and oh yeah, Iâ€™ve got these Valor points that can do a dozen more things.â€ seems like overkill.  So itâ€™s sort of a balancing act at the moment, where I have this sense that Valor needs to be a bit more, but not <em>too much</em> more, or the game just gets unwieldy.<br/><br/>Perhaps the answer is simply that stakes cannot resolve an Objective unless a Patriot (or the Patriots collectively) pays a certain amount of Valor?  Or defining Objective stakes for a scene automatically gives the Tory player some Valor, and the Patriot players will want to stock up some of their own before wading in to where it counts?  (Note: thereâ€™s a real problem with overloading the Tory player with too much Valor, since it becomes very feasible to spend Valor to get three face cards before the Patriots have even a few cards on the table.)<br/><br/>On a related note, the suggestion was made last night that, instead of making the Valor available to be won the same set number each time, the â€œValor Potâ€ could be determined by the longest meld.  So the truly impressive melds (they had six aces out there at one point) could actually stand for something beyond the current scene.  I really like this idea.  So thereâ€™s another variable to toss in there.
<h3>Cut Scenes</h3>
Iâ€™m also toying with the idea of restructuring the end-of-scene-frame-next-scene rules a touch.  Mostly, this is cosmetic; instead of â€œnarrating the end of the sceneâ€ Iâ€™m thinking of giving the winner of the scene the ability to â€œnarrate a cut scene.â€  Iâ€™m not entirely sure what that even means at the moment, but itâ€™s there in the back of my mind.
<h3>The Tory Player and Prompting</h3>
The last little bit that Iâ€™m hoping I can get the playtesters to chime in on is a matter of the Tory playerâ€™s role in the game.  Now, the Tory player is not supposed to be the Game Master.  The division goes: the Patriot players control and narrate for patriots; the Tory player controls and narrates the British, Tories, and allies; everybody has joint control of everybody else (neutral Indian tribes, for instance).  Note that stakes of individual scenes can make an â€œeverybody elseâ€ into a patriot or Tory, as we saw in the game last night when Mark set stakes of recruiting the mayorâ€™s wifeâ€™s lover.<br/><br/>Now hereâ€™s the rub.  Last night I was the Tory player, but I was also running a playtest of my own game.  I did a fair share of directing attention between players, prompting people to say their piece, and so on.  During situation creation, I think I did all of the calling on other people to ask them to interpret the dealt objectives.  Now, this isnâ€™t something that I should be doing as the Tory player; it is sort of a necessity as a guy running a playtest.  What Iâ€™m not sure of, however, is if the game can run without somebody playing circus ringleader.<br/><br/>Iâ€™m not sure how I can really find out if it works like I want it to outside of throwing a copy of the game into a room with some <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">poor saps</span> playtesters and watching from the sidelines.  The game isnâ€™t to the point where Iâ€™d want to shoot it out for full playtests, but it will be really annoying to get it to that stage only to find out that it needs a ringleader.<br/><br/>So Mark, Judson, Jim: what do you think?  Does the game need <em>somebody</em> directing traffic, or can people around a table play it like theyâ€™d play Monopoly?<br/><br/>And, as always, happy and eager to answer other questions or consider more points of view!                        </div>

                            Josh,<br/><br/>First of all, I've only skimmed this, I'll give it a more thurough read later.  But right now I want to say that just a skim read of this eats Full Light, Full Steam for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  This is awesome.  Rules based on violating the Bill of Rights? WOW.<br/><br/>With regard to your directing traffic question have you seen this thread over on The Forge?<br/><br/><a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=22268.0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=22268.0</a><br/><br/>I think the phenomenon you're describing is pretty much inherent in ALL games.  Take four people who have never played monopoly and take a fifth who knows the game like the back of his hand.  Over the course of the game you're going to see that fifth player doing much of what you observed yourself doing here.  There's nothing special about monopoly if only one person knows how to play.<br/><br/>As Ron points out in that thread every game needs a procedural leader.  He also, rightly I think, point sout that much of the problems in our hobby can be attributed to the confusion between the Game Master and the procedural leader.  If Adam is chosen as the Game Master because he's really good at providing fictional advercity but Bob is way better at synthesizing and communicating procedural rules all kinds of conflicts can arrise because of "Golden Rule" nonsense when Bob step ups to correct Adam on how the game is proceduraly supposed to be played.<br/><br/>When I Game Master Dungeons and Dragons I explicitly delegate procedural leadership to Dave or Patrick because they know all the feats and spells and attack of opportunity rules and what not, and I don't.  The "Game Master" in this case is not always right.  Dave or Patrick is.<br/><br/>I think that a procedural leader will naturally arrise based on who is playing the game and familiarity with its ruleset.  I'm not sure it's entirely a good idea to explicitly designate a procedural leader systematically.  But that would be your call if you think it somehow helps the game.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>

Um, we didn't play that way.  We left the rest of the meld on the table.  And honestly, if it were a discarded meld as well, we probably would never spend valor that way.  Maybe, maybe not.

Maybe?  I think the game does give an incentive to narrate freely, since you are in sort of a race to narrate out all your cards to the table.  I think what would worry me is being the player-most-familiar and someone else picking up the Tory role.  If none of us had the authority of familiarity with the rules (or being play test leader, or designer) I think a lot of the goading and calling on mis-plays would spread out pretty naturally.                        </div>

                            I don't think the game is complex enough to warrant a traffic manager... I think that's a better word for it (especially since I work in advertising).<br/>
<br/>
I do think that there are a number of "dangling" rules that don't necessarily fit the spirit of the game perfectly and trying to remember all of those is your only sticking point on watching someone bring it all together.<br/>
<br/>
But, again. With enough "game play" those problems will dissolve. I had a much better sense of what I was doing by the fourth rounds of cards and I think I was playing fairly well... even if Paul Revere was an uncoath ass.<br/>
<br/>
Does that help? Or did I miss your point.<br/>
<br/>
And I agree with Judson... Valor is less worthwhile if I discard the entire meld after swapping with you.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite> The question being, assuming the goal is to fulfill all three objectives, whatâ€™s stopping the players from simply playing three scenes, the stakes of each is one of the objectives?

(hopefully interest in the setting, the objectives, characters etc would motivate players to linger regardless of system...)<br/><br/>a simple rule that might work if valor doesn't cut it is to require players to win at least one scene before they go after an objective<br/><br/>The situation creation, pre-made historical figures, mad-lib personalization of the characters, and bill of rights based Tory interventions are all inspired. They were fun; plus they are good shortcuts to draw engaged play from an historical setting.<br/><br/> The american revolution as setting is in itself a great idea. As I mentioned after the game, it actually doesn't need the steampunk trappings to hold interest; we didn't use them much (partly due to our characters). There should definitely be an option to play normal history (which can still be madcap)<br/><br/>Since the set-up rules are so strong, the test will be how quickly any given group takes to the narrate/place card dynamics. I had a tendency to stare at my cards thinking of ways to incorporate multiple suits into a single narration. (how to say something that incorporated patriotism, station, and unorthodox, for example). As Jim mentioned after a few scenes one finds ways to strike a balance between rigor and speed. <br/><br/>I wonder if there could be some kind of 'training' round to get players used to this type of narration...                        </div>

                            Hi Joshua,<br/>
<br/>
First, this game sound GREAT. I can easily see laughing my head off playing this game.<br/>
<br/>
The use of cards to <i>inspire</i> everything from objectives to completing the objectives is really smart. (And I'm with Jesse on the Bill of Rights bit, too.) It sounds engaging, imaginative and guaranteed to provide a great time.<br/>
<br/>
What I find most fascinating about this is that you've built a kind of Fluid German Board Game. By that I mean, the German board games are essentially, good competative mechancis with Color painted on top. And here you've got this fun game where the Players are painting the color on top of the game's Objectives and the Conflict over the Objectives. And once a Conflict is done, the paint is wiped away, and the "playing pieces" are repainted again.<br/>
<br/>
Second, others have responded, but I don't think you need to assign anyone the traffic controller. My guess is that the guy who played the game before (or read the rules after buying it) will end up being the Tory -- if only because inexperienced players will tend to think there's strength in numbers against the guy who knows the rules. But, again, I don't think that needs to be formalized.<br/>
<br/>
Third, the Valor-business, pace of play and switching out the Tory...<br/>
<br/>
Don't do the Valor thing. I wasn't there, but just reading the idea you floated my head ache as I tried to figure out why you were about to break this lovely little game with all this extra business. Does <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> really need an Encumberance system to provide more variety for the play experience? No. And your game in it's basic gameplay s good to go, as far as I can tell from back here (and from reading about the reactions).<br/>
<br/>
And I sat here focusing on that question for a while. It seemed like you wanted more... something. Changing in pacing. A bit more back-and-forth like in a game of Go or something. (I came up with the same idea Mark did, about winning a scene before going for an Objective.) But the more I tried to figure out what you could add to the game, the more I kept thinking, "Why add anything? It looks like it's working <i>right now</i>. You created something the Players like doing. Let them do it!"<br/>
<br/>
So I re-read the thread looking for clues. And I came across the part where they wanted to start rotating the Tory right then and there. And I thought, "Ah."<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that that's your game. You've go this wonderful game for creating your playing pieces (the characters) and the Objectives and for resolving the Objectives. And people LOVED that. That's what they want to do, and they want more of it. And they want to be on the other side of it stopping people from doing it... so why not let them do it?<br/>
<br/>
If you generated a number of Objectives equal to the number of players, and then rotated around, you could make a game based off points scored by each player's turns as the Tory and a Son of Liberty.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, this drives it more toward a good, rock-solid competative game. But that's why I referenced the German Board Games -- it <i>is</i> -- a rock-solid competative game. Following the lead of the fun the players wanted <i>more</i> conflict. And they wanted a chance to vary the strategy.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know how you'd rig the scoring. It would be a shame if the Sons of Liberty in any way shivved each other. But whether with points, or number of conflicts one, I think some enaging horse race could be built.<br/>

                            Oh my god, Mark, that is going in the Reference section of the eventual book.  (I find myself pretending that's Thomas Paine and Alexander Hamilton rapping.)<br><br>A training round might be a good idea; I may reconfigure that first scene with constrained stakes to serve that purpose.<br><br>Now, as far as pacing goes, I'm not so much concerned about Valor points as I am about a systemic reason to play more than three scenes, with each scene being an Objective.  I mean, sure, it's nice to play tourist, but I'd like a little more directed tourism, as it were.  In other words, I want to encourage and support that tourist impulse -- and make it relevant to the mechanical progress of the game.  Now, <em>Dogs</em> doesn't have encumbrance rules, no, but it does have a secret hierarchy of sin going on that the Dogs have to uncover before they can address it.  With the Objectives laid out beforehand (which I'd be skeptical of changing), I need something other than the investigation to structure the development.  As Jason says, the players will rock out in the gaps, I have no doubt.  I just want to make sure there are gaps to rock out <em>in</em>.<br><br>Rotating the Tory player and then seeing who won the most, in both Tory and Patriot roles, seems interesting.  If the Patriots always won, it'd be a tie, but if the Tories won once or twice, it wouldn't be.  Hm.<br><br>As for the German Games thing?  I blame Judson.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            if each objective only has 3 scenes to it, then the players will only be involved in 9 scenes tops... which means the PCs had better get valor fast. right?<br>
<br>
so... the coded message would indicate what the three scenes are and where. helps to frame the game.<br>
<br>
and the rotating tory should be an optional rule<br>
<br>
as for dangling... let me do my best to explain... because in some instances i lack the vocabulary to assess things perfectly... puerto rico has a lot of "extra dangling" rules that make the game "better" but don't make the game cleaner or easier to play... and in fact, don't make a lot of sense.... they just add on to the game and you're forced to memorize all of them, because they don't adhere to a "spirit" of the game.<br>
<br>
3.0... for all its bad... has a spirit... and so even if you can't remember a rule perfectly, you can make a decision on how the rule should operate based on previous rules that you DO REMEMBER<br>
<br>
i call these extra rules... danglers... if there's a different word for it, i'll use that<br>
<br>
i realize i just compared a board game to a roleplaying game... but i didn't want to slam shadowrun<br>

                            Hi Josh,<br/>
<br/>
I believe I read <i>Dogs</i> differently than you do. At least from what you typed above.<br/>
<br/>
I don't think the structure of the game is "a secret hierarchy of sin going on that the Dogs have to uncover before they can address it."<br/>
<br/>
In fact, Vincent's text is explicit on two points: a) There's no need to keep the sins a secret (in fact, don't); and b) the whole point of the town's sins is to provoke responses from the Players. (For example: "The truth is that they start taking sides the instant you start showing them what the sides are. Itâ€™s immediate and visceral.")<br/>
<br/>
This might or might not seem like a subtle point -- but I think it's huge. Your phrasing makes it sound like a procedural issue. But it isn't that at all. Play isn't about figuring out what's going on and addressing it. It's about provoking choices from the Players on moral issues.<br/>
<br/>
Now, in <i>Sons of Liberty</i> I don't see anything like that. That's not bad. I'm just saying that when I look at what you've got so far I see a game <i>exactly</i> about addressing an issue. And specifically, it's an Objective. And more specifically, the game is asking me to justify with creative color the use of rules to gain a victory.<br/>
<br/>
This is a completely different matter than <i>Dogs</i> (or <i>Sorcerer</i>, <i>The Mountain Witch</i>, <i>Primetime Adventures</i> and so on...) because the game there isn't to win the game.... It's to be provoked and make choices for the PCs where the provocatio will lead.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, right now you've got a <i>Game</i>. A good game, it sounds like. But it doesn't seem to encourage hanging out in anyway because there's a) no world to explore; and b) no choices to explore.<br/>
<br/>
The Players have a task and tools for completing the task. <i>Delaying</i> the completion of the task won't invest them deeper in the experience. It'll just mean more work to get to the completion of the task. (And the additional rules will either be as fun as what you've got, or more fun, or not as much fun -- as you tweak.)<br/>
<br/>
So, in my view (which may not be worh much to you, since I managed to shut down the Thematic Calibration" thread all on my lonesome), if you want the gaps there, what are you adding to play besides "winning." Because right now that's what you've got -- and handsome job you've done of it.<br/>
<br/>
But is there anything to <i>play</i> with besides the rules toward victory. Because, again, I see now world to press against, no issues for the players to invest in.<br/>

                            Christopher, you are entirely correct that <em>SoL</em> is not intended to provoke big moral questions.  It's a romp.  So I'm not looking to add in big heavy themes or anything; that's for other games.  What I'm looking for is a mechanical device to extend the romp.  These can be thought of as little miniature sub-objectives that are necessary to accomplish the big primary objectives.<br><br>In <em>Dogs</em>, there's an embedded, emergent property of the game procedures that prevents the Dogs from walking into town and laying down the conflict, "I fix everything here."  It's the simple fact that, walking into the town, the Dogs don't know what's wrong to fix.  In fact, the Dogs usually participate in something like ten to twenty conflicts over the course of a given town.  Early conflicts are usually of the find-out-what's-happening variety.  Later conflicts are usually of the accept-my-authority-and-judgement variety.  It's the GM's job to lay out what's happening in the town, yes, but it's the GM's job to do that <em>in play</em>, the effect of which is to make play last more than one conflict.  That's what I'm looking for, here.<br><br>Now, in typing the first paragraph of this comment,  I may have stumbled across a possibility.  Perhaps, instead of situation creation generating three relatively discrete objectives, it generated one Primary Objective and two or three Supplementary Objectives.  In order to accomplish the Primary Objective, the Patriots must complete some of the Intermediate Objectives, with the assumption that the Supplementary Objectives lead into the Primary Objective in some way.<br><br>So you'd get something like this (these are pulled off the auto-generating webpage):<br><br>Primary:  The Sons of Liberty must misinform a street gang in New Hampshire to prevent the British from smuggling in a city alderman!<br>Supplementary 1. The Sons of Liberty must install a brother mason after the British build Tories!<br>Supplementary 2. The Sons of Liberty must spy on a city alderman while the British remove a Liberty Tree!<br>Supplementary 3. The Sons of Liberty must smuggle a court while the British install Quakers!<br><br>So the overall goal is to surrepticiously co-opt a street gang in New Hampshire so that they'll screw up the British plans to get this city alderman into town.  <em>In order to do that</em>, they've got to plant a spy into some Tory organization that the British have set up, then do some surveillance on the alderman in question while the British are occupied chopping down a Liberty Tree, and they need to get a court into town while the British are doing something with Quakers.  A little creative interpretation by the players in set up may create some situation where the British are trying to gain support in a New Hampshire town or city by getting one of their guys elected alderman.  They're drumming up local support (the Tory organization) and kicking down opposition (the Tree) and reaching out for allies (the Quakers).  The Patriot's goal is to incite a street gang to running the British-sympathizing alderman out of town, and to do so they must gather information from the Tory organization, spy on the alderman himself, and get a thuggish underworld court into town to convince the street gang that the alderman in question is responsible for the murder of Joseph Lightfingers, their fondly-remembered former leader.<br><br>The specifics can be toyed with, but perhaps the Patriots must complete at least two of the Supplementary Objectives in order to attempt the Primary.  Completing all three gets you a little bonus, maybe.  The important part being that this generates a more complex situation with more objectives that the players can play with and complete, and ties it all together to an overarching "plot."<br><br>I dunno; sound feasible, everybody?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Hi Joshua,<br/>
<br/>
As to your first paragraph, exactly my view. A romp. We're on the same page. I wasn't suggesting you add weighty material at all. My point is, <i>What kind</i> of material to add.<br/>
<br/>
I think solid, muscular <i>Game for Victory</i> material is the kind you want.<br/>
<br/>
Here are my thoughts:<br/>
<br/>
Rather than focusing on making the forward motion <i>longer</i> in an effort to prolong play and exploration, I'd take a look at more of a advance-and-setback model. (I'm sure there's a real term, but I have no idea what it is.)<br/>
<br/>
So, when the Sons complete a sub-objective, they advance toward the major objective. If the Tory wins, however, something is taken away, or the Objective is re-defined or what they did in the previous sub-objective no longer helps them get to the Objective. Or -- hmmmm -- if they fail a sub-objective they have to rush back to the previous sub-objective which has now turned south... or something like that. Something with more a see-saw quality than just forward momentum.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I've got this notion that I can't figure out that certain words of the sub-objectives are combined to form the Mission of the final objective. So you have to collect a certain number of words to build the mission. But as you fail a mission, a word is taken away...<br/>
<br/>
The fear, of course, in this kind of model is that the game will never end. But if balance properly this kind of game provides nail-biter glee in the second half in that completing any objective might put either side into victory.<br/>
<br/>
Also, maybe completing or failing missions collects bonuses of one kind or another that come into play for both the Tory and Sons. They could even be kept secret on one side or the other (or defined just before the play of the final Objective) so you get a few crazy effects for the final fight and strategy gets all hinked with a big more laughter.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I've been meaning to bring this up -- the whole weird science part: is that build into the character generation phrases? I didn't see it in the example. It seems to me that if you want this part, you'll add "Gets bonus X when using Y-weird-science thing/logic/tacic whatever." If you don't, I don't know if these things will get used in play. Give them a bonus for it, and it will.<br/>
<br/>

Yes, but that decision is in the hands of the players.  You can play Alexander Hamilton as a gadget-obsessed industrialist or as a networking military politician.  It's entirely up to the individual player, so players determine how much of the weird science appears in the game.  There are also some weird science bits in the situation creation as well.<br><br>I think we're on the same page in terms of scene progression; at this point it's just details of implementation.  That's the tricky part, of course. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br><br>Right now I'm thinking something along the lines of, "Each battle (ie session) starts with three Valor tokens in the middle of the table.  If you complete a sub-objective, you get a Valor token.  Valor can be used to Stick It To the Man in any scene.  In the final scene concerning the primary objective, any remaining tokens turn into cards in the Tory player's hand."  So Patriots want to complete subobjectives to rob the Tory player of cards and hit him with a Stick It; the Tory player wants to squash the Patriots in order to preserve his card advantage.  Or something similar. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br><br>I'm not sure if I'm happy with each battle being five scenes (intro, three sub-objectives, primary objective), but it's better than the amorphous blob it's been so far.<br><br><strong>Edit:</strong> Updated the <a href="http://kallistipress.com/SoL/objectives.html" rel="nofollow">objectives generator webpage</a> to reflect this change.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Y'know, Josh... maybe part of the romp-extension mechanic would be to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">translate</span> move the interpretation phase into play.  By which I mean:<br><br>Eliminate the 33rd Order Masons scene at the beginning.  Instead, Patriot Command gets the whist code, writes down the table transliteration and sends the Sons of Liberty to go take care of the problem.  Whatever the hell it is.  Now you've got scenes where Hamilton says "I think line two is a reference to an attempt by the British to blackmail the wife of the governor for her infidelities!" and the stakes of the scene are Hamilton is right (and foiling the scheme is either (and this is a design decision) achieved or achievable) or he's wrong, and the wrongness leads the Sons into a trap where they have to fight a whole buncha redcoats - or something.<br><br>Longest play, then, reduces to each part of the message needing to be checked out (i.e. each clause) and then the objective fulfilled - which is three scenes per objective, minimum. <br><br>The biggest weight in favor here was the entertainment value of interpreting the objectives at the beginning, which might be improved by sketching it out over several scenes.  And eases a lot of the challenge of framing a scene.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Yeah... gotta playtest that to see if it makes any sense in play, but I like the sense of it.                        </div>
