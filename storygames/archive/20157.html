The nice thing about the double conflict was that you could get what you wanted but wind up paying a price. Classic antagonism. <br/><br/>(I see that your using the option to sacrifice links as a possible price, but it's only ever a personal sacrifice by the protagonist, not a price that impacts the larger world like a normal Shock conflict could)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445069/#Comment_445069" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-02T09:24:44+00:00" title="May  2, 2015  9:24AM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Personally I think the two orthogonal intents in Shock conflicts are super-valuable and make play exponentially more interesting.

But, in retrospect, I was also right in my assessment that, retaining orthogonal intents, we wouldn't have made it to endgame in the allotted time - not even with the other changes in effect, as we only made it <i>narrowly</i>.<br/>If I were to play this game again with these same kids, I would happily include orthogonal intents in conflicts (though maybe still within some hack which doesn't use Praxis Scales: one complexity step at a time, please). We were playing with eight-graders, with strict time limits we couldn't bend.<br/><br/>Consider our list of priorities:\n<ul><li>It was a learning experience re: SF literature. Achieved.</li>\n<li>The kids had a good time: achieved.</li>\n<li>Using the full Shock setup as designed (except Praxis Scales): achieved.</li>\n<li>Their story arcs, however short and rudimentary, did reach a conclusion.</li></ul>\nWe couldn't possibly have crammed in anything more with the time and resources available to us.<br/>For one thing, I would have much preferred to leave the possibility of a three-scenes arc (more nuanced, less ham-fisted) open, but that proved impossible and I had to jury-rig the game mid-flight by crossing out the last four credit checkboxes from each Antagonist's sheet. So that's one personal priority of mine I had to give up. We managed to play exactly two scenes per Protagonist (six scenes total, in two hours, after spending an hour on setup) and only by aggressively moderating and enforcing a brisk pace: kids tend to wander away and ramble, and their wanderings and ramblings <i>were</i> actually part of the learning experience to a degree.<br/>So, let's say there wasn't anything else left I could sacrifice to retain orthogonal intents, this time. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445073/#Comment_445073" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-02T19:47:39+00:00" title="May  2, 2015  7:47PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yep, I hear you.
