Long-time lurker, long-time fan.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith all the great storytelling game experience here, I'd love to get people's feedback on to my own pet project, a homebrew mash-up of Classic Marvel and the "indie" system, WUSHU.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a condensed version of the rules as a kind of "quick start" guide.<br/>\n5 pages of rules, a copy of the Universal Table, and an extended example using World War Hulk (with pictures!) It should work, in theory... <img alt=":p" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/tongue.png" title=":p"/><br/>\n<a href="http://ozbot.typepad.com/FlipsideRPG_condensed.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://ozbot.typepad.com/FlipsideRPG_condensed.pdf</a> (pdf version, 1.9 MB )<br/>\n<br/>\nI've even set up a message board for some playtesting. (I'm not sure where else to invite others from around here, and it's really just an open call.) It is a pretty innovative system, I think, one that lends itself extremely well to a play by post system. I'd love to use the new system to write some ideas for adventures based on Civil War, One More Day, and Secret Invasion-- but let's go with baby steps before I get ahead of myself!<br/>\n<a href="http://marvelflipside.proboards105.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://marvelflipside.proboards105.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170042/#Comment_170042" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-19T06:33:23+00:00" title="September 19, 2008  6:33AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I glanced at the document.

If you are looking to use your rules for anything other than personal use, you may want to take a look and port to Four Color to avoid licensing issues.<br><br>My other first instinct: if you are going to add rolls based on details Wushu-style, you might want to convert from percentiles to d20s or some other single die resolution.  Then the player could roll a fistful of dice and look at them all at once, rather than re-rolling.<br><br>I've grabbed a couple of the pdf and will look at it more in detail later if you want more input.<br/><br/>Blue                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage" title="Number6intheVillage"><img alt="Number6intheVillage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.johnkantor.com/miscl/prisoner_ringtiny.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage">Number6intheVillage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170230/#Comment_170230" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-19T17:47:46+00:00" title="September 19, 2008  5:47PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't see the advantage (or difference) in using the Marvel table rather than the much simpler Wushu roll for successes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/boulet" title="boulet"><img alt="boulet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/534/nTWF4B3HT5CT6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/boulet">boulet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170234/#Comment_170234" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-19T18:57:38+00:00" title="September 19, 2008  6:57PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm puzzled too by this steep increase in crunch.

And another "yeah" about the percentile dice-- it might be repetitive, but that's why I "flipped" the table, so there are easy to identify roll-under numbers. Typical Rank has roll under 50 for Green, 25 for Yellow, 10 for Red.<br/>\nI really appreciate you taking a look, though! Thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nBoulet, Number6: Thanks for chiming in. And yeah, I *did* think about the whole added-crunch thing. In fact, I did a pretty straightforward Marvel write up in purely Wushu Open-style at some point in my thinking about this. (It's been percolating off and on for about a year.) The advantages I see:<br/>\n1) It makes Wushu's Principal of Narrative Truth the focus of a Marvel game. This is the most revolutionary part of Wushu that I just fell in love with, and it lends itself well to the Classic Marvel system, which also emphasized stunts (power stunts) and teamwork/action, etc.. I like the ideas of Target/Threat Ratings and Chi (in my mash-up, Drama Ratings and Reserves) and the idea that you don't get hurt, you just have narrative control or you don't.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) It makes use of Marvel's descriptive Ranks, Intensities, and Karma. On an abstract level, it's taking semantics that work well to reinforce the setting and making them matter, mechanically. On a more concrete level, it helps me understand how to better make Wushu threat ratings and pacing stuff. Using the ranks, you have more concrete guidelines in how to call a veto, how to set a Drama Rating, how difficult a Nemesis will be (while still allowing for freeform gaming, of course.) This also allows for other things that Wushu doesn't, like character advancement. As I'm typing all of this, I realize that this doesn't come through, necessarily, in the condensed version of the rules. The unabridged version talks about all of these things.<br/>\n<br/>\nand 3) It's fun. At least, it's fun for me, so in some ways I'm falling into that "write something that you want to play" kind of thing. I guess the bottom line is-- if I wanted a Wushu game, I would just play Wushu. If I wanted a Marvel game, I would just play Marvel. I kinda wanted to play a mash-up of the two, and so that's what I made.  It would be hard for me to admit, but if there's a consensus everywhere that it's absolutely no fun for anyone else, or worse, has ended up too "broken" for its own good, then I want to know that.<br/>\n<br/>\nDanny                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
