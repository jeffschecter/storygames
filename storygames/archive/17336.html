I can't give a tremendously detailed critique, but from memory:<br/><br/>There seemed to be a combat-system-shaped hole in the game.  I distinctly recall there was basically no consequence at all to being wounded (and maybe even no way to die, or too much resilience), which kind of removed tension from scenes which involved the threat of violence.  This also tied into our next concern:<br/><br/>The game over-incentivized one player to be the first to betray the others (which is, I think, a consistent failure point in John Wick games).  I get that in a spy game the threat of betrayal from within should be real, but the incentives seemed SO high that it almost seemed inevitable that there would be a double-cross, which then inevitably derailed the mission.  This synergized with the problems with combat, because we had a shocking betrayal at a pivotal moment, and we could not subdue the traitor.  I don't think a mission-based game really benefits from also having strong PvP elements (contrast with Agon or 3:16, where players jockey for position to be first among equals, but aren't rewarded for actively sabotaging someone else's success or the group's as a whole), but your mileage may vary.<br/><br/>I thought WoM looked really good on paper, but in my play it just seemed to have too many structural problems for me to enjoy (full disclosure: I feel this way about pretty much all of John Wick's games that I've tried).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392827/#Comment_392827" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-09T07:46:43+00:00" title="October  9, 2012  7:46AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Joe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392831/#Comment_392831" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-09T08:16:19+00:00" title="October  9, 2012  8:16AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I tried to run Wilderness of Mirrors at a local con and the two guys who played weren't really into spy movies. I hadn't realized how much of that genre is assumed as a support for making the game work. You *really* need spy movie lovers at the table. Otherwise, its a game where the GM says, here is a sentence, now you do the work. Okay, let's play through that and I'll make shit go wrong.<br/><br/>Also, the goal of chargen is to promote specialization, but the point values end up making it not work. I have 35 points (in the 2nd ed) to spend, so I can max out two stats easily. Great, so now I have a double niche. Which means there is less specialization, which I like about spy teams.<br/><br/>And like Joe said, the game is built on "screw your buddy", which I don't like so much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392838/#Comment_392838" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-09T08:50:32+00:00" title="October  9, 2012  8:50AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gotcha.<br/><br/>yeah, I can see that.

That's really neat.<br/><br/>But in talking to some guys that have played it, they say it doesn't work as well in play. Partly because so much of the planning stuff is front-loaded.<br/><br/>So my conclusion is that WoM was really innovative for its time. It helped get designers thinking about the idea that you could offload some of the creative work of creating the bad situation onto the players, which pretty much the opposite of how most pre-90s RPGs work. So it's really cool in that respect.<br/><br/>But I think that other games have come along and worked that ability for players to generate some of the situation and problems and made it more organic during play, rather than being so front-loaded.<br/><br/>The way AW and most of it's hacks accomplishes this is particularly elegant. GM moves like <b>Ask provocative questions and build on the answers</b> and <b>Respond with fuckery and intermittent rewards</b> and <b>Sometimes, disclaim decision-making</b> set up the ability for players to generate a considerable amount of setting and situation content right in the middle of play, which the GM can then respond to dynamically.<br/><br/>In one of the Dungeon World games I played a month ago, the GM gave us a super brief mission briefing and then threw us right into an In Medias Res combat. Then as we wrapped that up and accomplished a first goal, he asked us what the second goal of our mission was. So we generated the second half of our game on the fly right at the table. And we generated elements of who the enemies were going to be and what we knew about them on the fly as well, through answering provocative questions.<br/><br/>It was a great opportunity to see the promise set forth in Wilderness of Mirrors played out in Dungeon World.<br/><br/>That being said, Dungeon World doesn't guarantee as much player influence. It's built in more subtly, and you can play with much less of it present. In the next 2 rounds I played (with a different GM) there was a lot more pre-scripted events going on and less core content being generated by asking the players questions. The GM was less comfortable using that technique, so it didn't happen nearly as much.<br/><br/>So the upside of the structure Wilderness of Mirrors uses is that it pretty much forces the main content of the mission to be generated by the players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
