We decided to give Dungeon World a go and keep things a little light - no high drama.<br/><br/>I latched onto the idea of running a campaign in the vein of Ben Robbins West Marches which I'm sure you've heard of at this point.  So West Marches with Dungeon World - why wouldn't it work?  The players also seemed pretty jazzed and liked what they read of the system.<br/><br/>I'll spare you the majority of the fiction but basically a new continent had been discovered, popping up out of virtually nowhere.  It is ancient and full of a husk of an ancient civilization of unknown origin.  The adventure started with the PCs looking for a friend who had disappeared headed for the ancient cursed Moathouse to the Northeast at the base of the Withered Hand of Acherot (a mountain range). <br/><br/>5 players showed up and we had:<br/>2 Bards, 1 Elf, 1 Human<br/>Halfling Thief and his twin brother a Halfling Fighter<br/>A barbaric Human Fighter<br/><br/>The group travelled to the Moathouse taking care to avoid the mercenaries turned marauders plaguing the area.  I had them roll Undertake a Perilous Journey but hit my first point of confusion.  Should this be rolled for individually or as a group?   We decided to roll individually and I was stumped when one of them failed the roll.  I ended up saying they all got there but chose 2 from the list for that particular PC.  One did lose all of his food and there wasn't enough to go around - this ended up not being an issue as I wasn't sure how to handle this (blanket -1 to rolls ongoing till they found food?) and partially forgot about this later.<br/><br/>Hitting the Moathouse the group found several brigands taking refuge in a tower and quickly destroyed them (it helps having 2 Fighters in Platemail).  They discovered the dungeon beneath the ruins and descended into the unknown still in search of their missing friend.  <br/><br/>They ended up confronting 5 ghouls which I thought would be a crazy perilous encounter but ended up being a pushover (5 level 2 monsters against 5 1st level party members).  Three of the players suffered from Undying Plague which did cause them a bit of a nuisance.<br/><br/>They ended up confronting an 8 foot anaconda which attempted to constrict Fats, the Halfling Fighter and came across a scroll of Command Undead etched on a sheet of skin ripped from a Human sacrifice.<br/><br/>Finally they discovered their friend Harca who had gone insane and was painting a mural of an ancient temple and babling about a woman.  Half the party being evil they quickly put him down as his mind had clearly fractured and he was not the person they had once known.  He summoned a horde of Skeletons which the party cleaved through without issue (The Elf Bard tried to use the Command Undead Scroll but failed).  <br/><br/>I stole the open your mind to the purple worm chart from Tony Dowler and converted it for my purposes as the Halfling Thief was beckoned by the mural on the wall and opened his mind to the Temple (He rolled a 10 on the check).  He discovered the temple was known as the Grave of Words and was located somewhere on the edge of Nightwood to the south.  It boasted great treasure as well as serving as the prison of an ancient demoness.  They will be looking for this place in the future of course.<br/><br/>Some system stuff:<br/>The group really enjoyed the classes and Moves for the most part.  We had several instances where we kind of stumbled though.  We were having trouble with Spout Lore and Discern Realities when the player had questions which weren't really listed.  Several times the questions didn't really apply to the situation and we winged it.  It felt kind of awkard and I remember this feeling when we played AW awhile ago.  <br/><br/>Combat didn't feel off except for the fact that 2 Fighters in Platemail are tough as hell.  I think combat seemed pretty crazy and frantic because of the low power of the PCs and monsters and most things dying in a hit or two.  The pacing felt great here.<br/><br/>From a GM perspective I felt the list of GM moves are a bit hard to keep track of during play.  Reading them before hand is inspirational but it's a lot of stuff to remember and I find myself just falling into my own style of GMing and forgetting much of the MC advice.  I did write down some ideas/bangs ahead of time centered around certain moves which helped a bit.<br/><br/>There was some rules questions which came up, such as what does it mean for the Fighter's ability One Man Army.  I don't recall the AW crowd rules being listed in DW and while I do remember crowds were treated special in AW I don't remember how (I don't have the rules).  <br/><br/>There was also some consternation with Parley.  One of the players Parleyed another and the player decided to spend the hold by defending the original PC.  That's not what the PC wanted but it does appear viable via the rules.  We decided it didn't make sense as the PC Parleyed the other to try and pry some information out of him.  <br/><br/>Another thing, can multiple players Discern Realities or Spout Lore on the same item/location?  One fails so the other one tries a roll?  This seems a bit lame but I guess I'm open to make a move in response to a failure.  It just didn't feel right.<br/><br/>The game was a hit overall and we will be playing again in the future.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317910">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317910/#Comment_317910" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-27T09:52:59+00:00" title="March 27, 2011  9:52AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a disclaimer, I'll mention that I've played exactly one session each of Apocalypse World and Dungeon World. I have played one session of Ghost/Echo, too, though, which felt ballparky-close to AW. <br/><br/>So - Discern Realities and Spout Lore. In my experience, GMs have insisted that players make their questions fit, or they reconsider whether to roll for this particular thing at all. Maybe that seems like a copout answer, but it seems to me thus far that questions other than those listed are, somehow, "meant" to be answered in other ways. I've had moments where I went to roll for Discern, looked at the questions, and said, "I already know all this stuff." That, in turn, made me decide to use the info that I already had, and see what happened next.<br/><br/>As for multiple players doing it, I think a healthy dollop of compartmentalization is called for - in a DW game I played recently, I, a fighter, and the party mage, each rolled Discern Realities to learn more about a crazy, magical storm. The mage did much better than me, making our recon trip worthwhile; I failed hard on my roll, and the GM informed me that, obviously, the party mage was behind the storm, colluding with a cabal of hidden sorcerers. <br/>I had a lot of fun acting like that was 100% true <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Are you using the free .pdf version of the game? If so, I'm sad to say that things would probably be a bit easier with a copy of the AW rules in hand.

Seriously, it makes me day to read posts like these.  I'll take a look through and I'll see if I can't answer some of your questions.  I suspect Sage will jump in, too.\n<blockquote>I had them roll Undertake a Perilous Journey but hit my first point of confusion. Should this be rolled for individually or as a group?</blockquote>\nI've had some quandaries about this one, too.  You can really play it by ear.  If the whole party is wandering willy-nilly through the woods without any particular leadership, go ahead and have them roll individually or choose a member or two at random to roll for everyone.  If there's some obvious leader (often, the Ranger fills this role) leading the party, have them make the roll.  Let the fiction guide this move.\n<blockquote>We were having trouble with Spout Lore and Discern Realities when the player had questions which weren't really listed.</blockquote>\nIn this case, you'd want to listen to the questions the players are asking and answer based on the list - aiming to give them the spirit of what they want under the guise of the list of questions you've got.  So if you know they're looking around for danger, you can apply the answers you'd give to "Who's really in control here."  It's not necessarily a transaction of one-to-one with these rolls.\n<blockquote>From a GM perspective I felt the list of GM moves are a bit hard to keep track of during play.

They're though-provoking moves that, more often than not (much like AW) end up codifying the kind of Game Mastering most people who run dungeon adventure games tend to fall back on anyway.  Nothing to worry about here.\n<blockquote>One Man Army</blockquote>\nSage designed this one - I'll leave the answers up to him!\n<blockquote>can multiple players Discern Realities or Spout Lore on the same item/location?</blockquote>\nSure, but only as the fiction allows.  Remember, the cardinal rule for when and when not to roll is <i>to do it, do it</i> and <i>if you do it, do it</i> so generally a "Discern Realities" can follow a "Spout Lore" but not often the other way around.  The wizard spots a strange beasts' footprints in the mud, and so he says in his best, scholarly tones "Oh, this is the footprint of..." and rolls to Spout Lore - if he succeeds, he remembers or recognizes some important fact and can finish with "... the beast of Garlock, whose hunger for flesh is legendary" but if he fails, he's welcome to say "...some unknown thing, we should be on the lookout!" and subsequently roll into a "Discern Realities".  Often the information will be vastly different for each roll.<br/><br/>So, in this instance, if it makes sense (and isn't just roll-mongering on the part of the PC or the GM) go ahead and let it happen.  Let the fiction guide you here, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317917/#Comment_317917" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-27T12:08:19+00:00" title="March 27, 2011 12:08PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To add to what Adam said: make sure you ask the players what they're doing when they Discern and Spout.

Often you can give them a solid clue to it using one of the questions on the list. In a recent game, a player wanted to know why the goblins were acting so strangely. "Who's really in charge here" revealed that they were under the thumb of a big monster further into the dungeon. Finding out what the players really wanted cleared that up. Sometimes they players can't find out what they want to know. In this case, you can always suggest an alternative, like sending them to town to hire a particualr sage or something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318020/#Comment_318020" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-28T17:52:49+00:00" title="March 28, 2011  5:52PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome!<br/><br/>First a word on monsters: yeah, they're a little out of whack.

When you roll to hinder someone you roll + your bond and then if you suceed it's -2.  So it's nearly impossible if you're -4.  Why would someone ever subtract from their bonds then?<br/><br/>Volley seems soft because it's easy for a character to carry 10+ uses of adventuring supplies and never have to worry about ammo.  I have a player who always chooses to mark off ammo and it's never an issue.  I suppose encumberance rules will fix that but it seems hard to call BS on too many adventuring supplies when they could represent so many different things.<br/><br/>Parley - Can a player always Parley to intimidate, scare, or hinder monsters?  Seems kind of strong if Jim and his friend are facing off against 5 Orcs on Wolves and he parleys to scare them off.  He has +3 charisma though so it's pretty easy.<br/><br/>Make Camp - this seems a bit off as there's no reason to make camp to heal beyond level 1 (as it heals so little compared to actual HP).  Is that really intended?  Should I make them roll to "Make Camp" each night they stay in hostile territory?  Seems a bit ridiculous if they're travelling a week into hostile territory and we have to roll it over and over again.<br/><br/>Alignments don't seem particularly balanced.  We have an Elven Wizard who is Good and chose Cure Light Wounds from the Cleric spell list.  If he memorizes that spell all he can really do is cast Cure Light Wounds over and over and over again and his chances of failing aren't that low.  Should he gain experience each time he casts this spell (or any other) since it meets the criteria "When you cast a spell that benefits someone else, mark XP."  <br/><br/>Another alignment oddity is the Fighter who is evil.  Should he gain XP from killing a defenseless Orc?  That doesn't seem particularly evil but I guess it fits the criteria.  <br/><br/>Our characters seem to be hitting nearly 20XP a 3 hour session which seems really high.  Is this intended?  They blew by level 2 in a hurry.<br/><br/>The Thief's Use Device ability seems crazy good.  Does this mean a Thief can wear platemail and wield a huge weapon?  Can he still sneak around and do thief things then?  That seems way too good and is a no brainer for any thief to take.  <br/><br/>We're still loving the game, we just hit lots of little bumps like the above questions and we kind of roll with the punches.
