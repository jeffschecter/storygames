For example, on comic book MU*s and Buffyverse MU*s in particular, where there's a strong element of narration (the former) and comedy via dramatic irony (the latter), there's a LOT of jokes, snarky commentary, little-did-they-knows, and so on in various bits of narration.

They, in the applications I've seen, are primarily about recognition, reinforcement and appreciation for a largely static thing.  They generate more verbal artifacts into the game-space to be appreciated by the group as illustrating that thing.  This is not a bad thing.  It just bores me.  What you're suggesting (without a greater context) seems to be more or less the same thing but instead of producing verbal artifacts for appreciation you have literal artifacts.<br/><br/>I don't see much difference between having a stack of little pictures that are more or less there for everyone to hold up and say, "Look at these." than the pile of verbal transcript memories of all the times I got to say, "I"m a man of ACTION!"<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133824/#Comment_133824" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-10T15:29:03+00:00" title="March 10, 2008  3:29PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            *Points at Puppetland.*                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133833/#Comment_133833" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-10T15:51:47+00:00" title="March 10, 2008  3:51PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My last post was way meaner than it should have been.

(I mean, isn't that the basis of "Pictionary"?)<br/><br/>But, like Ron, when you tell me "hey, let's play an RPG" and then make something I don't consider part of RPGs a central element of the mechanics (whether it's drawing or dancing or singing or whatever), I'm going to get annoyed.  And then I'm going to get up and leave.<br/><br/>It's too bait-and-switchy: by calling it an RPG, you're supposed to be giving me <i>useful information</i> that tells me what the activity in question is going to be like.  Stray too far outside the usual boundaries of an RPG, and you're now actually giving me FALSE information.<br/><br/>It's like saying that we're going to go see a movie and then mentioning that in this case "go see a movie" means that we'll watch a couple of trailers and then play a game of tennis.  I like playing tennis and I like seeing movies, but personally, I can tell the difference between the two activities, and if I'm agreeing to one I'm not necessarily in the mood to do the other instead.<br/><br/>So my advice would be that if it's a fun game but it doesn't look or play much like an RPG does, then for the love of all that is good and holy, don't CALL it an RPG.  Just call it a game.  Call it a board game, or a card game, or a parlour game, or a drawing game, or make up a new word for it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133890/#Comment_133890" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-10T22:30:03+00:00" title="March 10, 2008 10:30PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>"Pictionary"</blockquote>\nHere's how I <i>would</i> dig drawing in an RPG: if someone said "Let's do something that's kind of like an RPG, but where character creation and the resolution mechanics are all Pictionary-based."<br/><br/>Like, you make a character by drawing it. You're not allowed to say anything, and you're not allowed to put words in the drawing. Then, you show your drawing to everyone else, and they all guess what it's supposed to be. But here's where it differs from Pictionary: it doesn't matter what you were <i>trying</i> to draw, all you get to do is pick one (or more) of their guesses and <i>that's</i> what your character is.<br/><br/>Then you do typical RPG stuff for a while, framing scenes, describing actions, etc. until a conflict arises... or at least until someone <i>decides</i> a conflict arises. <br/><br/>As soon as someone yells "conflict!" and points at you, you immediately shut up and start drawing. If they point at you and someone else, you both start drawing. Since there's no discussion allowed after "conflict!", your drawing needs to covey both what you think the conflict is about and how you're trying to resolve it. Then you show your drawing(s) to the group and again, pick someone's guess and that's what happens.<br/><br/>With the right group, I can see getting a couple solid hours' worth of beer and pretzels fun out of a game like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne" title="Ajax_Aldwyne"><img alt="Ajax_Aldwyne" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2379/2234027609_bbb4299fe9_m.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne">Ajax_Aldwyne</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133914/#Comment_133914" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-11T03:29:48+00:00" title="March 11, 2008  3:29AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 11, 2008 6:56AM by Ajax_Aldwyne.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judson Lester</cite>Also, what about the "write 150 words" chargen for HeroQuest?  Having done that, HQ remains my top game to create a character in, and I'm not sure how different, really, that is from "draw a picture of your character."</blockquote>\nIt's an essential part of the chargen process (if you don't chargen as you play), not a do-this-and-get-extra-points carrot.<br/><br/>To return to the orginal question, I wouldn't like this bonus/reward system <i>if the bonus was consequential</i>. Not because I don't like to draw: I do like it and I occasionally draw my characters (or other things). I am not a good drawer, but I don't care as I play with friends. I draw when it helps me in defining something or in communicating it. Or for the fun of it.<br/><br/>Still, I wouldn't like this. Maybe it's the rebel in me. I'd hate if drawing was rule-mandatory while not being necessary. I would not like bonus-points-for-a-sketch because I play rpg to have fun and I know how I want to have fun, I don't need the game to tell me how. <br/><br/>If the bonus is consequential, I will feel like it's mandatory-in-disguise. I don't like mandatory (if not necessary), and I like hypocrisy even less and it's probably how I'd interpret it. I probably won't play/like this game.<br/><br/>If you were wanting to please me, I\u2019d advise you this: if you <i>want</i> drawings, make drawing necessary, essential in your design. Drawing should not be easily replaceable with a classic mechanic like a character description. (Sadly, I have <i>no</i> idea of how one might accomplish this.) Don't worry too much about drawing-skills, as I still have to see a system that adequately mitigates differences in speaking talent, imagination, creativity, confidence, system knowledge, math and logic, \u2026 which are necessary player-skills for most rpg. OR give small rewards, like you might for things like writing an adventure summary, writing/saying a poem, writing/playing/singing a song, writing a short story, \u2026 (I am not sure I like these rewards, even if I use them, but they will not bother me to the point of disliking the game.)<br/><br/>Otherwise you gave me a very interesting idea : fishing (\xe0 la Mountain Witch) with drawings.

You can get an extra XP (1/3 of a session) by, in the game downtime between sessions, you create artifacts like pictures, bluebooking, recording/typing up replays of the sessions, etc. <br/><br/>2) In Eric's RBH, there are two large squares to write your weapon stats ("Sword: Heavy"; "Yari: Reach"; Shuriken: Ranged" etc). Eric doesn't say anything, the rules say nothing, but everyone, EVERYONE, finds themselves drawing little pictures of their weapons in those squares. It was an amusing and awesome side-effect of having boxes for weapons and armor. Characters themselves I'm not too good at drawing, but I love drawing exotic weapons, costumes, gear, artifacts, etc.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133972/#Comment_133972" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-11T09:16:39+00:00" title="March 11, 2008  9:16AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite>Now if it was a game with some sort of currency for world design, and you could earn currency by creating cool things in the world, with more currency earned for designing crests, maps, portraits, poems, languages and the like, and then in turn spend it on the chance to create *more* things in the world ... well I'd be interested, but it would be just like my average GM'ing effort, and the reward for that is a cool game, what more do I need?</blockquote>\nThis is interesting. Creating stuff would give you more chances to create more stuff...<br/><br/>Now you got me thinking. A drawing mechanic in a "common" kind of RPG (as in with characters, items, skills, NPCs and stuff) would seem kind of lame and would appeal to few people. But what about a "creation" game?

This is more like the RBH thing where everybody doodles in play about their characters.<br/><br/>Also, do maps get the same reaction?  Is drawing a map as outside the roleplaying experience as drawing a character portrait?<br/><br/>Jason, I'm not sure where the awesome die problem crops up -- you're not drawing for anyone else's approval.  You're just drawing, and perhaps like in Everway, you call out little parts of the illustration as things that are important to your character, thus giving yourself a bonus for whatever that thing was.  "This is his katana.  It can cut through tin cans and nazis.  Extra die!"<br/><br/>Hituro, what are you contrasting this "currency for world design" against?  That seems to me to be what I'm talking about -- I draw my guy with a tribal tattoo, I'm inserting by implication his tribe and where he stands in it.  I draw a massive ziggurat with orc guards around it, and I'm inserting that into the game.

But it would only work during chargen or for a very limited amount of time. I mean, in a one shot or short story, it would work wonderfully. But if you pretend to keep growing and improving your character (during an ongoing campaign or saga), the available space would turn out to be a problem. Sure, I could erase some of the stuff I drew before, but eventually it gets old. Trust me, I have a full page with all the magical and cool items my character possesses, and I'm a little concerned I'm running out of blank space (and somehow using a second page doesn't appeal me

                   I think I'm agreeing with someone above when I say that drawing would need to be a central part of the game for it to work, instead of a one-off bonus during character generation. It's just a gimmick and an irritating one at that, otherwise. Thinking about it, I would be interested in seeing how a game where drawing in some form was integral. Maybe a game that created a jointly created, drawn artifact at the end of play (like a map, cast of characters or something like that).<br/><br/>The sticking point, as mentioned repeatedly, would be the different skill levels of the players at the table. People who don't draw well would be intimidated by those who do. And drawing is one of those skills where difference in ability can be extremely obvious and jarring when juxtaposed. How does one get around it? Well, one could implement some rules that might address this. A couple that spring to mind immediately include having everyone adopt a simple, coherent visual style, something in the vein of pictographs, or maybe something more or less completely abstract. In some ways, it would rein in the better artists and have them using the same visual toolbox as their artistically unskilled peers. Essentially, they're playing with a handicap. The downside is that the talent of the better artists is somewhat hobbled and whatever weird and wild shit they might have otherwise contributed is limited, but to do otherwise relies on player skill, as Jason mentions. But I wonder about that. Is it so awful? Hard to say since this game is so hyperhypothetical.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134024/#Comment_134024" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-11T11:47:29+00:00" title="March 11, 2008 11:47AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My father made an interesting observation this one time we were playing <i>Pictionary</i>.<br/><br/>I draw. I have drawn most of my life. So I don't draw bad at all. Yet my pictionary sketches were as bad and funny as everyone else's. So what "edge" did knowing how to draw gave me? Self-confidence. I don't think of my drawings in "they suck" or "they are artsy" terms. I think about what I want to communicate, and how could I better let people understand it. And so I drew sticky figures and weird shapes. I could have spent hours drawing that "automobile" so people would know I was drawing a "photorealistic portrayal of a car". But isn't the point of the game drawing fast and funny and "understandable" drawings?<br/><br/>So I feel the problem lies in here. More than quality, the problem might be comfort. Most people don't draw, so they don't feel too comfortable about drawing "for" others.

You're just drawing, and perhaps like in Everway, you call out little parts of the illustration as things that are important to your character, thus giving yourself a bonus for whatever that thing was. "This is his katana. It can cut through tin cans and nazis. Extra die!"<br/><br/>Hituro, what are you contrasting this "currency for world design" against? That seems to me to be what I'm talking about -- I draw my guy with a tribal tattoo, I'm inserting by implication his tribe and where he stands in it. I draw a massive ziggurat with orc guards around it, and I'm inserting that into the game. Is it just the part where the drawing translates into dice that bothers you?</blockquote>\nI want to break down the reasons for my resistance before I comment on the character-creation-drawing thing. First off, obviously I write. I wrote a game and I've done novels and short stories and whatever. I HATE writing character background. A single paragraph of character background? Not a problem for me. But I prefer to have a short character idea (right now I'm playing a half-breed from Tombstone who was treated as an outcast by everyone in town other than his mother) and then be able to fill in details as I go along. There is no way that someone with a 12 page character background can accurately play that history and who cares what my first dog's name was. I want to be able to introduce cool character elements in play. But you know what? If someone offers me extra build points in exchange for a character background, they're going to get a half-page character background out of me. But I'll resent it and probably do a half-assed job because that's not my prefered way of bringing a character to life.<br/>Now, I don't have any hang-ups about people seeing my writing. But I SUCK at drawing. Even as far as stick figures, I'm pretty bad. I can draw trees well, but unless the game we're playing is, like, Trees: the Woodening what you're going to get from me as far as a self-drawn character portrait is going to be pretty sad on the best of days. Far from making me feel connected to the character, every time I see that thing, I'm just going to feel disgusted with my crappy drawing. But I'll do it for the character creation points. And then I'll conveniently lose it, especially if Storn's sitting at the table with his rocking "Knife Guy" character sitting there in my face. <br/>So I hate the idea of having to draw a character portrait to get build points being built into the system. Hell, I hate the idea of having to write a 5-page essay about a character being built into the system. <br/><br/>But. If character creation for a game is drawing-based, that's a different story. That's like Pictionary in that most people's drawing for that is going to be pretty bad in a lot of cases. Maybe Storn's character looks awesome with his knives and his no-shirty muscles, but most people I know are going to be Order of the Stick level at best. Which is fun, it's a bonding experience. I'd probably feel differently about this if everyone I knew were a professional sketch artist, but they're not. <br/>Hell, we're even producing a game out of Green Fairy Games in which character creation is about 50-75% drawing. <br/><br/>So to summarize, I don't mind doing drawings as the act of character creation itself, but I resent being extorted into producing a truly terrible piece of art if I don't want to hobble my character. Because I'm not seeing getting the build points as a reward, I'm seeing not getting them as a stick.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134430/#Comment_134430" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T13:15:54+00:00" title="March 12, 2008  1:15PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Damn, Justin, it's like you're <i>reading my mind</i>, except you actually managed to put it into some semblance of order and make it relevant!  <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/><br/>Our gaming group abandoned the idea of "bonus points for bonus work" a while back, mostly because the people who would contribute character pictures or write up background stories or make a webpage were all going to do those things anyway, regardless of whether they got points for it.

I'm jumping into this discussion after reading only about half of the stuff posted above, so excuse me if I'm repeating someone. I used to be a person who was totally unable to draw, I learned it a year ago (1 year 23 days to be precise), and now I can and I do. Nothing to brag about, just to tell you I've been on both sides of the line. And here's what I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all, if you have a mixed gaming group that has both "artists" (short for "people who can draw at least a little bit") and "non-artists" (short for "people who can't draw a damn thing"), it would be totally unfair to grant bonus points for drawing a character. This is different from other chargen-stage things that give you bonuses: for a non-artist it is not the question of not wanting to draw his/her char, it's a question of not being able to. So, it's like saying "whoever has blue eyes, add +10 to your PC's Charisma stat" - unfair things like that tend to seriously piss people off. Among people who use long words I think it's called discrimination.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, for a homogeneous group of artists (a fully non-artistic group is obvious: they'll just kill you for mocking them) it is still not completely fair if the bonus amount is fixed. Even without taking the level of ability into account, there almost surely will be some people who're gonna sketch their characters with a pencil while riding a bus, and there will be others who will deliver a fully-coloured piece of art with shadows, background, cool effects and stuff like that. So, this basically means you have to specify the conditions beforehand by saying something like "whoever brings a b/w sketch gets +1 SSP, decent coloured pics give you +3 SSP each", where SSP = Some Shit Points (can be experience, character, action, drama, or whatever you're in to). Even then it would help to have either people of approximately the same level of drawing ability in the group, or people who are really friendly and helpful toward one another. Artists are fragile beings, you can't just tell 'em they suck, and they are insecure enough to read that message in any comment.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, as a side remark: be careful with drawing someone else's chars, I've seen immersive players being all "WTF?! I'm not like THAT at all!!" about the picture they don't like. This is potentially dangerous, can spark off-game conflicts.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the broader topic of contributing to the game beside the actual role-play, it's quite common in forum-based games, at least in the ones I'm involved in. Players who draw, draw; players who have huge collections of pics (say, dA favs), choose to stea... ehrm... borrow things from there; others make video clips, photomanips, write wiki text, make diagrams, beautify maps, etc. This just encourages to reveal your creative side, demonstrate your talents, produce something while waiting for others to post and overall increases the fun. I don't think I've ever considered this to be something to be explicitly rewarded for, perhaps I'll try it next time and see how it works out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136794/#Comment_136794" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-28T10:37:37+00:00" title="March 28, 2008 10:37AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Ballistic Roby</cite>how adamantly a spoken-word artform is the RPG?</blockquote>Cool!

GLASS has a mechanic whereby wearing (extensive, evocative; i.e. "race" stuff like pointy ears or full body paint) make-up gets you additional Starting Exp; but, of course, you must always wear it, every session. This is to both incentivize doing things that adds richness to the game--a reward for being further "in character" than the dude who can just show up, put on his tabbard, and go play--and to provide a minor burden to the player seeking additional Leet Powerz at game-start.<br/><br/>Of course, that extends to all elements of the system design, in that there are ALSO very few ways to do IC something you can't actually do OOC. No "uber swordsmen" who can't hold the right end of a boffer, let alone swing it for more than three minutes without getting winded.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Ballistic Roby</cite>LARPS are a thing apart from RPGs, either partially or in whole.  Yes?  LARPers, weigh in?</blockquote>Nope, not I. Different techniques, different focuses in system, more or less enablement of fantastic capabilities; but not inherently different in their narrative, acting, immersion, setting, situation, or "role playing" aspects. Nor in rewarding for enriching the game. (Do none of you give Exp bonuses for good RPing or for taking One For The Team?)<br/>---<br/>As a brief aside: I am surprised at the vehemence of negative reactions--are you all Gamists? SO WHAT if you don't want to make a drawing, monkey? Forget about the 10 Exp and move on to The One True Way To Have RightGoodFun. Ditto character backgrounds. Ditto a catch phrase (Champions). Ditto a theme song to cue up when you're getting giggy. Fuck it, man, do what YOU want: it's YOUR RightGoodFun. Give up the bennies.<br/><br/>Fuck, while we're at it, don't make a Belief in Burning Wheel--who cares about munchkinesque Artha at Story Games?!? Instincts, too: they're just power-gamer free actions at the start of a DoW/Fight/whatever.<br/><br/>Fine, I can see a "bait and switch" if you're invited to "RP" and the base mechanic is sketching your actions in sand with your semen.

You could say the same about just about anything, after all.<br/><br/>Because yeah, RPGs require tons of skills that aren't particularly common or are not well-developed, the same as skiing or ping pong or translating ancient Latin poetry, and some people are going to say "Hey, that's fun, I'm going to learn these skills so I can keep doing this!" and some people are going to say "I don't enjoy this, and I'm not going to waste any more of my limited free time on it."  Some people may really like the activity but be nearly incapable of ever learning the necessary skills to do it, and eventually run out of people who are willing to play with them.  ("Bob's a nice guy and really loves playing tennis, but he's a lousy player and I need a partner who can keep up with me.")<br/><br/>Introducing a new, "weird" skill into a game can and probably will change the demographic interested in playing it.  Adding in something like drawing pictures or running marathons or doing interpretive dance into a RPG?  Well, you'll probably lose <i>me</i>, depending on how important that new skill is (or how important it seems to be) to the game, because those aren't activities that I really enjoy, and in fact I'd think having to do them would ruin my fun completely.  But maybe it'd be the tipping point that pulls that artist or runner or dancer into the game who would've never given it another look otherwise.  And if that's the case, hey, go for it.<br/><br/>(But if the "weird" skill is just something scabbed on to the usual RPG framework -- "draw your character and get 10 bonus points!" or whatever -- then I guess it's not a big deal.  I might still play that game...but you'd better believe that I'd want to draw a big fat line right through that suggestion, because in the groups I've played with, bribes just don't provide enough benefit to offset their cost.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_137162">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/elliott20" title="elliott20"><img alt="elliott20" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/elliott20">elliott20</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137162/#Comment_137162" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-31T10:31:45+00:00" title="March 31, 2008 10:31AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            right now in my local Burning Empires game, we were going to start rewarding fate points for doing things for the game. one guy gets a fate point for each gaming journal entry he writes for us, one guy gets points for bringing in some food. me?

The fate points in this case, is just gravy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/5991/drawing-stuff-for-stats" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/5991/drawing-stuff-for-stats" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/5991/drawing-stuff-for-stats/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F5991%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F5991%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
