The Heart is in her backpack, wrapped in oil cloth, and she is racing across the rooftops to escape the dead-but-living cultists behind that are in pursuit.  The rooftops end at a cobblestone street and a 25' gap yawns between her and the next set of roofs.  World class athletes can make this jump - after years of training, running on a track, completely unencumbered.  For The Thief, none of these are true.  She is going to jump, so she jumps, and she rolls the dice...<br/><br/>This had me asking a few questions.  Do you modify a roll like this or is that a leftover instinct that doesn;t belong?  What is the top of the 6/9/10 scale?  Does a 12+ allow for super-human effort, does the fiction dictate that, or both?  I saw a few options:<br/><br/>1)  Don't modify the roll, a 10+ gets her across the chasm.  If she misses, scale Soft or Hard moves accordingly.  She is The Thief after all and I am a fan of her character.  I don't want to just say no, then again, what happens when the next jump is 30'?<br/>2)  Modify the difficulty with  -1 or -2.<br/>3)  Change the scale.  A 12+ is successful, 10/11 is partial success, 9- gets you a hard move.<br/><br/>How do you do it at your table?  Do you let modifiers enter into your games or just let fiction dictate what is possible and what is at stake?  Where do you see the top end of the achievement scale in DW?<br/><br/>For the record I chose option 3, she got a 10; she made it over by her fingertips and had to choose whether to drop her sword or the Heart.<br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jbinc" title="jbinc"><img alt="jbinc" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/106/nFRMKD4VH4ILG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jbinc">jbinc</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398434/#Comment_398434" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-22T09:24:08+00:00" title="November 22, 2012  9:24AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like you made a fair call to me - like you say, you're a fan of her character.

In general, if the next jump is 30' across, you just say "You can't make this one" given your set of premises -- if it's impossible, it's not a roll.  (That next jump being 30' across can then be the result of a soft move or a hard move by you placing it there, but I digress.)  If I was going to do modifiers, I'd do option <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> I think -- it's functionally the same thing as option <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> (albeit you collapsed the range a bit, but still) but it seems to fit a bit more with the rest of the system -- you never change TNs in DW, but you do change modifiers.  <br/><br/>Definitely not wrong to change the scale, though, it's just a more drastic change and whatnot.

Was it part of your set-in-stone prep? Had the character measured the jump beforehand? Were you making a move and purposefully putting in a bar to the character's path (make them backtrack) that she decided to try and overcome anyway? Or simply giving her an opportunity that fits her class's abilities? If so, then the exact distance in feet means little.<br/><br/>This is all part of the emergent fiction yes? The thief is running for her life across the rooftops and you are a big fan. You show signs of impending doom (a big arsed gap), If she fails a move then sure put her in a spot (the untenable gap), or let her try in all of the suggested ways above.

There's always something that can make the narrative more interesting: "Sure, you cut down the cultist without getting hurt, but your blow is so powerful it cuts the chain next to him, sending your friend plummeting into the pit...!"  <br/><br/>Of course, this is with World of Dungeons, which doesn't feature set moves the way Dungeon World does.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398543/#Comment_398543" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-23T20:03:48+00:00" title="November 23, 2012  8:03PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 23, 2012 8:12PM by Paul_T.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I personally like to think of a 7-9 as a "yes, but" or "yes, and", but Vincent's formulation of acting under fire and some of 7-9 results for a hard choice are, basically: "Ok, you can still do it, if you want, but this is gonna happen too."<br/><br/>In the AW text, there is an example where someone wants to drag a wounded friend out from the battlefield. The 7-9 outcome the MC decides on is, "OK, you can drag them back, but you're going to have to take a bullet yourself. Will you?"<br/><br/>I guess it can work if the choice is meaningful enough. In the case of the "jumping across the chasm", it's meaningful enough, I would say, because there are crazy cultists (who presumably want the Heart back) chasing the character. I could see a player going, "Shit! I can't make it across. I'll throw the Heart to the other side, and then face my pursuers empty-handed!"<br/><br/>How many of you use this in play?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398545">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398545/#Comment_398545" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-23T20:11:02+00:00" title="November 23, 2012  8:11PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So here's a thought I'm having:<br/><br/>This whole move, roll, and choose business is based on Otherkind dice. As long as you remember that, you can easily make your own custom moves on the spot.<br/><br/>First, break the player's intent into two different things (if possible). Then add a third danger/harm/new problem.<br/><br/>In this example:<br/><br/>* You get across the chasm.<br/>* The Heart gets across the chasm.<br/>* You don't break your leg doing it.<br/><br/>And then you can control the fictional "difficulty" as follows: <br/><br/><b>Easy version</b><br/>On a 10+, you get all 3.<br/>On a 7-9, choose 2.<br/>(On a 6-, choose 1, or leave it to the MC move, as you prefer.)<br/><br/><b>Hard version</b><br/>On a 10+, choose 2.<br/>On a 7-9, choose 1.<br/><br/><b>Totally Impossible Version</b><br/>Same as Hard version, but add one more bad thing to the list of things.<br/><br/>(This is very much like how seize by force and go aggro are differentiated in AW.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398547/#Comment_398547" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-23T20:15:31+00:00" title="November 23, 2012  8:15PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Holy shit you are a motherfucking genius Paul.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398548/#Comment_398548" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-23T20:15:34+00:00" title="November 23, 2012  8:15PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think a good shorthand for play is to think of 7-9 as two different but similar results. <i>Yes, Except</i> and <i>No, Unless</i>, and use whichever one seems most fitting at the moment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398557/#Comment_398557" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-24T00:30:36+00:00" title="November 24, 2012 12:30AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">@Orlando_Wilson</a>: Yeah, we're in agreement.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>: Yep.
