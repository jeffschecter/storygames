It seems pretty cool and has a bunch of great ideas. I can't help but wonder, though... are the minotaurs in this game a metaphor for black men? It seems like many of the characteristics of Czege's minotaurs come from a soup of stereotypes (including negative stereotypes) about black men. They are big and strong and dark in comparison to the humans. They come from the mud and have a a strong affinity for the jungle. They have trouble controlling their rage/their bestial side. They are mostly an oppressed underclass of laborers. They are deeply spiritual. They want to have sex with human women, and any child born of the union will be a [male] minotaur.  That's the weirdest thing, because there are no female minotaurs. If this is a race metaphor, what does it mean to have a game about black men set in a world where black women don't exist?<br/><br/>There's also this passage: <br/><br/>"Also, your minotaur doesn\u2019t actually have a name at the beginning<br/>of the game, and won\u2019t until he accepts one from another minotaur<br/>after a specific shared experience that I\u2019ll explain in a bit. Until then,<br/>human characters mostly call him \u201cyou,\u201d or derogatorily, \u201cbeast,\u201d and<br/>other minotaurs call him \u201cfriend\u201d or \u201ckin,\u201d or with affection, \u201cbeast.\u201d<br/><br/>In other words, it seems like "beast" is being used in the setting like the n-word.<br/><br/>It's hard for me to believe that Czege wasn't thinking about this when writing the book, especially because he talks about using metaphors for current events and social issues as a tool for adventure design.  His extended example has a gossiping blue-and-white homunculus named FriendBeast  as a very thinly veiled metaphor for Facebook (needless to say, this is one of the weakest parts of the book). <br/><br/>Has anyone else read the book and noticed this dynamic?  Any idea how to respond?  One possibility would be to try and hide it under the rug, saying "this is an immersive setting, any similarities to our world are coincidental, and we'll play them down as much as possible."  Another thing (maybe what Czege intended?) would be to acknowledge the analogy and draw on it in play.  But frankly, as a white dude I would feel really uncomfortable trying to take my very limited understanding of what it means to be black in america and using it to portray literal jungle beast-men in a fantasy world. That seems messed up. Is there a third choice? (besides not playing the game?).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WMSkyfall" title="WMSkyfall"><img alt="WMSkyfall" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WMSkyfall">WMSkyfall</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440638/#Comment_440638" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-04T22:06:55+00:00" title="December  4, 2014 10:06PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Having had a similar reaction to the game during the Kickstarter ("isn't this pulling from a lot of Jim Crow-era negative stereotypes of black people?")

The problem is that such a response denies the artist any possibility of examining the signifier itself - as a general attitude applicable to many things - decoupled from its well-known earthly exemplars.<br/><br/>Remember that episode of South Park where the kids can't understand what's wrong with the South Park flag - showing several white men hanging a black man - because they hadn't even noticed the skin colors?  To them it was just a picture of some guys hanging another guy.  Decoupled from any historical or racist reference, it's just a picture of the act of hanging, which is just one way humans can mistreat other humans.<br/><br/>I assume that <a href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">@PaulCzege</a> is interested in calling into focus various aspects of racism and culture clash without referring to earthly "races".  You know, kinda like Gene Roddenberry used to do.  I would suggest that the tropes mentioned above represent not white/black per se, but rather chauvinistic "dominator culture" views of neighboring peoples who are viewed as "backward" due to differences in custom and technology, or "Olympian" views of the "Chthonic".  Like how the word "barbarian" really meant "anyone who isn't a Roman".  This is common human societal behavior.  You can find similar dynamics and attitudes - complete with pejorative slurs and moral disparagement - arising between neighboring Asian cultures, neighboring Mediterranean cultures, neighboring African cultures, neighboring European cultures, even neighboring states and cities in the US.<br/><br/>Because of historical earthly precedents, assumed signifieds and the potential for such misunderstanding, an artist who wishes full freedom to explore themes and dynamics such as "culture clash" or "racism qua racism" must create a fictional space for it - which is exactly what Czege has done.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada" title="Coalhada"><img alt="Coalhada" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada">Coalhada</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440640/#Comment_440640" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-05T01:12:49+00:00" title="December  5, 2014  1:12AM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's likely that US readers will identify these attributes as being those ascribed by stereotype to black Americans, for obvious reasons. But these are ways in which, as As If mentions, many marginalised groups have been vilified.<br/><br/>It's not so long ago that these were the same pejorative stereotypes assigned by the dominant majority of England to the Irish, who were depicted as violent brutes, caricatured in cartoons as apes. <br/><br/>In Hong Kong today, there exists a marginalised underclass that consists of only one gender - the Filipino and Indonesian "domestic helpers" (they mean maids), referred to derogatorily as <i>bun mui</i> ("Philippines servant-girl"),  or "Maria". Every Filipina is a "Maria". <br/><br/><br/>p.s. I take issue with some of the OP's reading of the text. I don't see that the minotaurs in TBTW are darker than the humans, nor that they particularly "want to have sex with human women", at least not any more than human men do - technically speaking, the minotaurs are also human. They just look different. They also don't have more trouble controlling their rage or bestial side than "humans". <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440647/#Comment_440647" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-05T09:38:54+00:00" title="December  5, 2014  9:38AM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Out of general interest, to me as a desensitized non-American writer (I mean, I just see patterns, really) Paul's minotaurs look like a metaphor for indigenous peoples; I haven't read the game text yet, but part of the impression is perhaps because I understand that the minotaurs live in their own homeland, so there's no rootlessness and alienation brought about by a cross-continental passage in the mix. More like Australian Aborogines than blacks in America, that is.<br/><br/>The "wanting human women" seems like a simple thing to explain, incidentally: were I writing this stuff, I would have put that element in there as a phantasmagoric cleave and complication; the fantasy simile is more true to life with a boldly controversial (for the in-setting people, that is) element like that, and it makes segregation, the standard fantasy answer to race relations, an answer with problems of its own. No neatly separate city state in their racially thematic terrain landscape for the minotaur-men, it seems!<br/><br/>Regarding your question about political gaming, Ignotus, have you considered twisting your perspective around? The game is not asking you to inform your fantasy play with your experiences as a black American, but rather it offers you the opportunity to create a fantasy story that might in hindsight give you new insight into race and racism in our own world. I do a lot of thematic gaming myself, and this is generally how the creative process is oriented: we do not come to the game table ready to dazzle our friends with out keen wisdom about the politics of whatever, but rather we answer viscerally to the fantastic imagery involved in the game, and by this means potentially elevate our appreciation for the themes involved as well.<br/><br/>(It occurs to me that <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i> is like this all the time. You literally can't kick a ratman in that game without it being a thinly veiled metaphor for real-world history of colonialism, sexism, religion, and so on. I generally hold that you don't need to be an expert of the political history of southeastern Asia to play the game, though.)<br/><br/>What I mean to say is that playing a fantasy game like this does not require you to be an expert on black issues, even if we conclude that the game is specifically an American metaphor for American treatment of the black minority. It is sufficient that you are able to imagine an oppressed minotaur people and immerse yourself into the speculation, and therefore perhaps realize something or other about that social and psychological state of affairs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440652">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440652/#Comment_440652" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-05T11:16:02+00:00" title="December  5, 2014 11:16AM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>we answer viscerally to the fantastic imagery involved in the game, and by this means potentially elevate our appreciation for the themes involved as well.</blockquote>Agreed.  I think this is the upside, Ignotus.  You play your fantasy jungle beast-man as a fantasy jungle beast-man and see how it goes.  In the end, maybe your takeaways have nothing to do with the real world, or maybe they're slightly mind-expanding in a non-specific way, or maybe they give a tiny dose of insight into the experience of black men in America, or Aborigines in Australia, or whomever.<br/><br/>I see the downside too, though.  If you feel that play obliges you to portray characters who cleave too closely to harmful real-world stereotypes, and such portrayal makes you feel icky, then it makes sense for you to not play that game.<br/><br/>To me, navigating the upsides and downsides in play seems like the responsibility of the group.  No game book is going to arbitrate how maturely and compassionately the players explore the material.  If you want to talk about how to do a good job of that, I'm sure there are many folks here with good advice to offer.<br/><br/>(If you instead were feeling questionable about supporting this work and its author, then I'm sorry to have missed the point!

Even a book that was explicitly about black Americans could (fairly, even!) be read to be a commentary on race relations in general, or oppression in general. For people without the relevant cultural context, that might even be the most straightforward reading.  But that doesn't make the book not about blacks. It's pretty clear to me that the "signifiers" I listed are specific enough for an American reader to invoke blacks rather than other ethnic groups. Eero, the minotaur origin story is that four minotaur infants were pulled from the mud by humans and brought to the human city, and all minotaurs are descended from those original four. They created their culture while living among humans. In other words, minotaurs are not a colonized native population, or even an immigrant population that brings a slice of their homeland with them. So that's another reason why I tend to think this is drawing particularly on the black experience.<br/><br/>I'm less interested in arguing over my interpretation, though, which will be unproductive over the internet, and more interested in talking about how and whether to play this game, given my interpretation. <br/><br/>Eero and David, I take you guys as arguing for the first suggestion from my post, focusing on the setting as immersive and trying to react to it directly rather than as a metaphor. I think the main challenge of that is that the strength of the signifiers will make it hard for some of the people in my gaming group (myself included) to react authentically to the setting instead of looking through it to what it references. I wonder if there's a good way to help disrupt those associations and obscure/remove the racial symbolism without abandoning the aesthetic and the details which are what bring the setting to life.<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440667/#Comment_440667" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-05T15:57:36+00:00" title="December  5, 2014  3:57PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't personally think that my suggestion about creative perspective is the same as pretending that the metaphor doesn't exist, but if it seems that way to you, then the odds are that we're just focusing on different details as important for the creative exercise.<br/><br/>Regarding helpful ways to distance the metaphorical from the real, couldn't you just change the incidental setting details that suggest black culture into something else? For example, maybe the minotaurs are blue-skinned and are fond of tea ceremonies, and that might then help confuse your self-consciousness as to their meaning. (Been reading the <i>Guide to Glorantha</i>, for those wondering about the blue-skin bit.)<br/><br/>I am curious as to whether the setting might work better for you if we postulated that the minotaurs come from the high and snowy mountains of the far north, where humans established deep mines and brough forth the minotaur race from cuts of stone. They could be sort of swarthy in skin color, hairless in summer and with thick winter coats through the winter months. They could be known for being lazy, morose, alcoholic and prone to violence. Still spiritual, and bigger/fatter than humans, perhaps because this helps them retain heat in the harsh winter conditions.<br/><br/>(That alternative minotaur vision is based on Nordic Sami stereotypes, to be explicit. The idea is to ponder whether this problem might be as simple as switching the African jungle planet for the Nordic ice planet, as it were.)<br/><br/>Insofar as I've had analogical experiences about gaming that cuts close to the bone in political matters, my experience has been that I've wanted to become more comfortable with facing the issues and discussing them, rather than more skilled in ignoring them. If this creative goal were considered desirable here, then one would have to conclude that the problem is with you being uncomfortable with discussing blackness, more than with the game for choosing that topic. I don't have anything resembling the wacky American experience race epic in my background, though, so for all I know I might sing a different tune if the matter struck closer to home <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440689/#Comment_440689" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-05T23:11:23+00:00" title="December  5, 2014 11:11PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I take you guys as arguing for the first suggestion from my post, focusing on the setting as immersive and trying to react to it directly rather than as a metaphor.

No idea if it'll work for you.<br/><br/>1) Openly discuss the signifiers before play, so no one has any feelings of "this hasn't been addressed" gnawing at them during play.  Resolve as a group that it is, in fact, worth trying to overcome this problematic content and play anyway.  (If this step fails, then I guess you probably don't play this game with that group.)<br/><br/>2) Everyone create characters they can most intuitively inhabit.  Create someone who is more like you than they are alien.<br/><br/>3) GM in a "reporter" style.  "This is what you see.  This is what you hear.  Here's what happens."  Keep meta chat and transparent manipulation of the fiction away from the main act of play.  Make it as easy as possible for everyone to forget that they're sitting at a table with books and dice, playing a game.<br/><br/>4) Immerse in your character's sense of place.  You are them.  Whatever situations they're faced with, react as if you were them, there.  This is the key for me.  The previous two points are just to enable it.<br/><br/>When I play this way, I lose myself inside of the fiction and the "what would happen?" experiment of pretending it's all real.  Real-world reflections only come later, once immersion is over.  I realize that this is not what "immersion" means to everyone, and though Clay is described as an immersive game, I don't think my particular version is specifically what it's aimed at.  I recommend it only because it's worked for me.

It seems like some of the issue is that the game is not so much telling stories about genuine Black people as it is telling stories about White-created caricatures of Black People.</blockquote>\nIs "genuineness" anything more than an aesthetic claim that dodges the need to engage in actual discourse? One would call their own work and conclusions genuine to escape criticism, and other people's deeds ingenuine to put them down. Is there a way to use this concept that does not beg the question of the quality of the work, or is "genuine" just a synonym for "the good shit"?<br/><br/>I'm asking because the way I think of this is that people are trapped by their preconceptions regardless of intentions, and for this reason it is futile to strive for perfect knowledge prior to engaging the world at large. Applying this to art, I think that there is value to investigating the sociology of oppression through storytelling <i>even if</i> your story revolves around counter-factual details or misunderstandings about the real world.<br/><br/>I'll sketch a crude example: let's say that our gaming life has brought us to a place where we're dealing with say American race relations via metaphor, and our black human stand-ins are being portrayed as stupid, lazy and morally backwards people. Via exhaustive play we come to conclude that these qualities make segregation the only feasible option going forward for this fantasy situation. Or, alternatively, we come to conclude that <i>even if</i> people are culturally or biologically a little bit inferior, that is a socially irrelevant factor in comparison to the political costs of engaging in an apartheid plan of some sort, given the world we've developed here through play.<br/><br/>Perhaps, for another round of play, our next adventure is set in a different town in fantasy America, where the fantasy black people are, due to deep-cutting cultural details (maybe their underground magic totem hasn't been rooted out in this town by mining expeditions, unlike the last place we looked into), somewhat different: they're honest, hard-working and spiritually rich in a way that compares favourably to the dominant culture of the setting. Again, conclusions are drawn by us, through play.<br/><br/>The point of my hypothetical is to ask whether an exhaustively genuine understanding of the real world black condition as it exists now in some specific place is the only worthwhile method through which a person might engage in story gaming like this. Is play like that necessarily worthless, disrespectful or even harmful (to us or others), unless we have a suitable background for engaging in it? I've written about this before on this forum, as I personally hold any attempts at engaging the world as valuable; the most ignorant redneck, should they make the attempt to pretend to be an elf and perhaps find out something about being a member of a minority culture, finds grace in my eyes, even if their elven portrayal is informed by nothing more than stereotypes about niggers and watermelons. Engaging in debate about say the advantages and disadvantages of integration vs. segregation, and how practical details might sway political choice either way, seems beneficial to me no matter how thin the factual expertise underlying the work. Better we talk than fight.<br/><br/>To me this is a pretty wide-reaching question, as I don't really see much difference between Paul's minotaurs and say the goblins of D&amp;D, except that it is apparently considered widely beneficial in the US gaming scene to pretend that goblins are not a racial minority in the sense these minotaurs are, and therefore nobody needs to worry their craniums over which particular ethnic minority might be metaphorically engaged while dealing with those bloodthirsty, savage goblins <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>To play the Devil's advocate for a moment, I'd like to note that the obvious counter to my position would seem to be to say that it is, in fact, very much awful and non-desirable for ignorant fools to engage in cultural practices without expert oversight. The poor redneck, he will hurt himself trying to think too hard about race relations, and instead of clarifying his ideas and expanding his world, he'll just end up reaffirming a false consciousness and wallowing in his own turds. Truth is not something you discover by thinking about things and talking them over with your peers, and doing so without sufficient gnosis will just lead you further into falsehood.<br/><br/>While I rather hold onto the former ideas about the nature of wisdom rather than the latter, I could see how there's some attraction to the idea that ignorance breeds ignorance, and outside intervention is the only way out. If this is held to be the true nature of wisdom, then it most certainly makes perfect sense to be hesitant to play roleplaying games about racial politics without having at least some experts playing at your table. I would also take a hard look at other possibilities that might be used to stamp on ignorance and spread true wisdom, were this the truth about the manner in which human beings learn and grow better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440706/#Comment_440706" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-07T01:17:54+00:00" title="December  7, 2014  1:17AM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/arscott">@arscott</a> I'm saying there's no black or white in there to begin with.

Some the most insidious terms are common words like "we" and "them" in some contexts -- that's usally a good telltale sign that I've fucked up, a record scratch that immediately halts the convo and shifts it over to facing our prejudice, and fixing our hearts.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Ignotus">@Ignotus</a>, thank you for this thread. In accordance with (my (mis-?)understanding of) S-G's policy on thread necromancy, I'll refrain from trying to confront the many posts in here that I disagree with the way I would if their posts were fresh -- who knows, they might have changed their minds since.<br/><br/>All I can do is give my own perspective which is that I agree with making a connection between fictional blue vs orange prejudice to real-world prejudice, and with shining a light on similar phrases and imagery from both the racism and the resistance in the real world. What we do with these games is up to us. It's probably the most difficult part of tabletop gaming for me.<br/><br/>From Aufseher/"colonialists", Protection from Black, Orcs and Varisians, the Blood War -- everything resonates with these issues for me and sometimes it's too much. On the other hand, they are a tool. I can rant for a while how the rulebook flavor copy of colonialism/triangle-trade boardgames like Puerto Rico and Navegador seem shockingly oblivious to any real or perceived problems with what they describe as "glory days" but I also know more about historical racism because of them, because of research I did to try to fill in the glaring gap in their presentation.<br/><br/>Idk, I fuck up all the time and worry about having done so in this post as well.<br/><br/>I never want to justify or promote racism. I can argue for Keep on the Borderlands to be a tool to subvert, question, deconstruct Manifest Destiny ideas but to be honest I'd be happier if "the classic sandbox module" didn't have any racial themes at all. If it were <i>all</i> about human emotion, the folly of technology, the fraught in-group relationships, or mere discovery instead.<br/><br/>Similarly, Tomb of Annihilation, for all its successes as <i>game</i> design and module/book organization, deserves the criticism it's getting for it's often clumsy portrayal of cultures and their agency or lack thereof. Can we use it as a tool to address racism and prejudice in our own culture, bringing problems up for discussion in a way we couldn't as easily in a hushed movie theater or an isolated reading chair? Yeah, we can and do but, like, I wish the game didn't even have these problems. They've given me hate when I know there is love.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chiarina" title="chiarina"><img alt="chiarina" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chiarina">chiarina</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475344/#Comment_475344" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-14T11:05:25+00:00" title="July 14, 2018 11:05AM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here is the link to the summary of John Wilson:<br/><br/><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/7nehwo8iifek6ac/TCTW_summary_JW.pdf?dl=0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.dropbox.com/s/7nehwo8iifek6ac/TCTW_summary_JW.pdf?dl=0</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475351/#Comment_475351" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-14T19:51:35+00:00" title="July 14, 2018  7:51PM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great stuff, thanks (to both of you).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475352/#Comment_475352" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-14T22:27:43+00:00" title="July 14, 2018 10:27PM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't understand the mechanics after reading that but I am impressed by the creativity of the setting! <br/><br/>Would it be interesting to people to have a separate thread about issues like metaphors for racism in RPGs?
