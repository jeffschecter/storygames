I'm going to be running SotC for three friends who've never played it before, this Saturday.  The one* thing I always found problematic in that game is the way stress boxes work.

Aspects aren't quite as pervasive in Icons as they are in FATE, nor is Determination quite as tied to them as Fate Point are. I haven't been able to playtest it, so maybe it'll totally change. I dunno. All I know is that I kinda strongly dislike the way aspects are implemented in Icons, so I figure there's nowhere to go but up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332222/#Comment_332222" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-29T07:26:15+00:00" title="June 29, 2011  7:26AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            nemomeme, seems to me like your idea would work if the player knew what their target number was before rolling\u2014otherwise there's way too much, "guess what the GM is thinking" going on.<br/><br/>Which also means that for opposed rolls, you really have to do Aspects-after-rolling\u2014which is fine, really.
