Yeah, that's how it still is to some extent, but back then, you knew there would be a flood of supplements for as long as the publishers could churn them out. Also, metaplot heavy settings seemed to gain traction in those days.<br/><br/>Like for a while there, after certain companies like WW and FASA hit it big with those approaches, any new game (well, a lot of them, at least from the big publishers) that came out was oriented that way.<br/><br/>I guess.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MummyKitty" title="MummyKitty"><img alt="MummyKitty" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/582/nF6IT7RM67QPV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MummyKitty">MummyKitty</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61893/#Comment_61893" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-22T23:28:36+00:00" title="March 22, 2007 11:28PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dropped out of RPGs in the 90's and am just getting back in...

That's definitely an about-face from the '90s. <br/><br/>I mean, a huge part of Eberron's design aesthetic is creating a setting where D&amp;D makes sense and the setting elements facilitate play. I don't think FR or GH really do as good a job.<br/><br/>But, I could be brainwashed by lots of hippie theory. I look at games like <i>Serenity</i>* and think, "Has this writer been in a coma for the last ten years?"<br/><br/><br/>* Sorry to harp on this. My D&amp;D group is going to be playing a few sessions of <i>Serenity</i>, so I've been reading the book.

I agree with you that the 3.0 FRCS is one of the best books WotC has produced. I just wanted to point out that a design imperative for Eberron, afaik, was that it should fit the 3e ruleset and various D&amp;D tropes. I think a lot of 2e settings (and some d20 settings) came up with spiffy concepts first and then added in the AD&amp;D ruleset as sort of an afterthought.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon" title="Vaxalon"><img alt="Vaxalon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/42393690/1509967"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon">Vaxalon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61932/#Comment_61932" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-23T08:12:15+00:00" title="March 23, 2007  8:12AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's what I like about Xcrawl... it makes the whole D20 thing make sense.

It was rare for any player to buy much of anything supplement-wise for a game. OTOH, in a given group, almost everyone owned a game that they GMed for the rest of the players.<br/><br/>With the beginning of the WW Splat model, people playing characters began to buy stuff. And the stuff they bought was from a single compnay, rather than being spread around. The fact that WW tied several lines together at least vaguely compatibally to form the WoD was also different. TSR might have given rules for bringing your Boot Hill Gunslinger and your Gamma World Mutant Badger into AD&amp;D, but at no where near the level the WW character were able to move from game to game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D" title="Thomas D"><img alt="Thomas D" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://landfill.thesnakefarm.com/images/misc/idescols.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D">Thomas D</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61940/#Comment_61940" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-23T09:15:52+00:00" title="March 23, 2007  9:15AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For the physical design and marketing, you started seeing games move from box form to book form.  (I recall TSR holding onto the boxed set for longer than other game companies with product lines like Planescape, although FASA did release a box set for their Shadowrun line.)  This also moved games out of toy stores to other specialty stores like comic book shops and retail book stores.  This book form generally was the standard size hardcover we see today for the core rule books and softcover for the inevitable wave of supplements.  I'm thinking that White Wolf started marketing their game through retail bookstores at this time when very few companies were, which may be one factor in how they introduced so many new gamers into the hobby.<br/><br/>Binding technology was still being perfected, so if you've got a softcover game supplement with pages falling out, it's probably from this decade.  <br/><br/>The interior art was usually in black and white with some color plates, although I recall a Shadowrun supplement that had a third ink color used on a fold-out city map.  This didn't work out too well as they used various shades of cyan for the ten plus different neighborhoods they color-coded.  The map looked like a big blue blot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61945/#Comment_61945" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-23T09:48:37+00:00" title="March 23, 2007  9:48AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A few things: <br/><br/>Pretty much since D&amp;D started, supplements have been a vital part of RPG lines.  The eighties started with Call of Cthulhu and Champions in 1981, both of which had plenty of supplements.  Later major eighties lines included Middle Earth Role-Playing (MERP), James Bond 007, Chill, Marvel Superheroes, and GURPS.  Also, the 1980s saw the rise of the Dragonlance series which started the fiction tie-in and metaplot concepts.  <br/><br/>But yeah, the splatbook (i.e. player supplement) and the metaplot (i.e. story told through multiple RPG supplements) were innovations of the nineties.  The splatbook was pioneered by, say, the 1985 release of Unearthed Arcana, and the metaplot by Dragonlance.  But they became ubiquitous in the nineties.  <br/><br/>And though plenty of eighties games were released as standalone books, the nineties did see the end of boxed sets in favor of the colorful core book.  Mechanically, games pretty much standardized on rules-medium (i.e. there were few Aftermaths and few Marvel Superheroes in the nineties) -- with a preponderance of dice pools.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61946/#Comment_61946" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-23T09:51:40+00:00" title="March 23, 2007  9:51AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gloss was also big in the 90s.

T&amp;T had two derivatives that used the same core system -- Mercenaries, Spies, and Private Eyes; and Monsters! Monsters!  I'm thinking Traveller was pretty close to unified mechanics, if not actually there, as well.<br/><br/>In the 80s, there was also James Bond 007 (originating the "one big table for everything"), and TSR did several other games that had Marvel-Style universal tables -- their Conan game, one of the editions (4th?) of Gamma World, and I think there was another, but can't remember which it was.  DC Heroes also did the universal table thing, albeit in a different way.  Bushido was skill-based, with a d20 roll for success and degrees of success depending on how well you rolled.<br/><br/>Like JD, my recollection is that only D&amp;D and its close cousins (I'm tempted to say "ripoffs" -- Arduin and Talislanta, for example, which both started life as third-party D&amp;D supplements) were of the many-mechanic variety.  Pretty much anything that was skill-based instead of class-based had a unified system or close to it, even back into the 70s.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62429/#Comment_62429" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-29T08:23:51+00:00" title="March 29, 2007  8:23AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: efindel</cite>...one of the editions (4th?) of Gamma World...</blockquote>\n3rd. 4th used an AD&amp;D2e-derived "multi-mechanic" system.<br/><br/>Hmm... maybe it's just that I remember "unified" mechanics being a "thing" in the '90s, whereas, in the '80s, it was something that happened, but not something touted as "this is how RPGs ought to work".

There were plenty of universal-mechanic games in the eighties, but GURPS and HERO were not among them.  <br/><br/>James Bond 007, Marvel Superheroes, Chill, Ghostbusters, Star Wars, Ars Magica, Cyberpunk, and Shadowrun were all very much unified mechanic -- as much as nineties games were.  I would say that Basic Role-playing(CoC/Pendragon/etc.) and Rolemaster/MERP also are pretty close.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt" title="Matt"><img alt="Matt" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/6464691/920923"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt">Matt</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62458/#Comment_62458" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-29T11:37:51+00:00" title="March 29, 2007 11:37AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JonathanWalton</cite>The 90's was also the time when a few companies tried to commercialize American larp.

Runequest may be the first skill-based game (and this would be enough to get it a place in the "Museum of Innovations in roleplaying", even not counting Cults of Prax), but it had different damage dices, some skill had critical effect and others didn't have them...   For an "unified mechanics" game, I think that you should NEVER have to ask "what kind of dices should I throw?"<br/>\n<br/>\nEven GURPS isn't one. Damage dices. You can't count them as a integral part of the unified mechanics, because with some skill you don't roll them, and with others yes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62546/#Comment_62546" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-30T07:18:47+00:00" title="March 30, 2007  7:18AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yup, BRP is easily my favourite system, but I don't see it as a unified mechanic system especially.<br/><br/>Not that I regard that as especially important, provided you don't have a ton of subsystems to recall I care little whether a game has one or a few.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arminius" title="Arminius"><img alt="Arminius" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/588/nMC0KH12ZK6VM.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arminius">Arminius</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62601/#Comment_62601" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-30T17:31:45+00:00" title="March 30, 2007  5:31PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Upthread someone said Talislanta was a close relative of old D&amp;D, but I struggle to see the similarity in the resolution mechanics.
