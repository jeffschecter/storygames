Amazing, when you write down what you want, you start finding ways to make it happen. So I've just come back home from running Lady Blackbird with my regular Tuesday group (which now has 9 players, but due to illness we were down to 5 tonight \u2014 it was my one shot at making this one shot happen).<br/><br/>I'm late to the party, I know. Everyone else has moved on to Danger Patrol now. C'est la vie.<br/><br/>I read the first page out loud to the group and gave everyone a chance to look over the second (setting) page. All the characters got snatched up except for Bishop. We quickly ran over the rules and got started.<br/><br/>The first attempts at escaping the cage in the brig failed and the resulting ruckus caused some clockwork stormtroopers fresh from the rewind facility (do I steal liberally from other AP's? Yes, I do) to come investigate. Vance started beating Snargle against the cage door. The clockworks opened the cage to put an end to the violence at which point Blackbird zapped them all with a lightning spell.<br/><br/>Arkam repaired one of the frazzled clockworks and reprogrammed it to do his bidding. They had it lead them down the corridors of the ship, acting as if it was escorting them as prisoners back to the Owl tasked with the story that they were being sent to clean the Owl and mop it down so that Captain Hollas could take it for a joy-ride later. Snargle's player was getting restless for some violence and mayhem and was completely ignoring the Key of Conscience, so Vance ordered him sneak through the ventilation system, find the engine room, and cause havoc that would serve to distract the crew from our escaping heroes. <br/><br/>Meanwhile our heroes and their clockwork escort were confronted by an officer with a clipboard. This officer didn't buy the deception and called for more clockwork guards. It escalated quickly into a fight. Our heroes won, but not without Vance going down, nearly dead.<br/><br/>Around this time Snargle made it to the engine room, swarming with goblins working the valves and levers. Snargle stood up and started shouting inspiring words, charging his goblin brethren to cast off their shackles and rise up against their oppressive overlords. Nevermind that the goblins were actually highly-paid members of the engineer's guild. Snargle put his entire pool into it and got 5 hits. A riot ensued. Valves were spun the wrong way, levers were yanked out of sequence, dials were pulled off of the consoles. The whole Hand of Sorrow began tilting, dangerously beginning its descent out of the sky. <br/><br/>Lady Blackbird, Arkam who was carrying Vance, and the reprogrammed clockwork made a dash for the Owl. With the Hand falling, they were being thrown all over the docking bay. Everyone climbed onto the clockwork who was able to tread along one of the iron catwalks with its magnetic feet. The arm Lady Blackbird was holding onto fell right off the repaired clockwork, but Arkam managed a daring swing on the clockwork's extra tubing to catch Blackbird before she fell out the bay doors into the endless blue.<br/><br/>Snargle and his army of revolutionary goblins couldn't make it to the docking bay, but they did manage to find one of the fighter decks. Each goblin climbed up into a fighter, started it up, and catapulted off the deck and out of the falling Hand.<br/><br/>On board the Owl, the crew quickly realized their pilot wasn't going to show. Vance was the only one with them who could fly, but he was pretty groggy. We did a flashback refresh scene back to when Lady Blackbird first hired the Owl and its crew. Vance was able to get rid of his Dead condition, and everyone reset their pool back to 7.<br/><br/>Then we snapped back to the present. With Arkam providing as much power from the engine as possible, Vance disconnected the Owl from the suspension straps in the bay and gunned the bird out of the bay doors. They found themselves amongst a swarm of fighters: half of them were Snargle and his fellow goblins, the other half were Hand of Sorrow flyboys. Blackbird strapped herself into the turret of the Owl and started shooting down badguys as Vance maneuvered to set up shots for her.  Meanwhile Snargle and his charges snaked around in harrowing dogfights. Our heroes eventually came out on top.<br/><br/>But the Owl wasn't going to get very far without any fuel. Vance put the bird into a nose dive and started descending parallel with the falling Hand of Sorrow. Arkam, suited up and went out the hatch with a fuel hose, free falling over to the massive fuel tank of the Hand to do a mid-air siphoning of the imperial fuel supply. Arkam got back into the hatch, and Vance pulled back on yolk and the Owl narrowly escaped being pulled down into the Lower Depths.<br/><br/>Vance set a course for the Remnants.<br/><br/>I had a good time with it. I really took to the "asking questions" method of GMing that the game advises. The players all seemed to enjoy themselves. The characters are all tightly packed packages of awesome.<br/><br/>The trait and tag dice plus the pool dice got a little weird. With the fact that you can add dice to your pool beyond its initial value, and helping dice coming from other people's pool, and trying to remember to spend the pool dice when you succeed and return them if you fail, makes for a lot to keep track of. I've got an idea for a hack to streamline it all a bit. But it's late now, and I have to get to bed, so I'll talk about that tomorrow.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220192/#Comment_220192" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-22T14:41:51+00:00" title="July 22, 2009  2:41PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I use different colored dice for the pools.

I'm not sure it was really hard on the individual players. It was just a lot for me, as GM, looking over everyone's shoulder to see if they were doing it right. I might just need to relax a bit.<br/><br/>I was thinking it might be cool to have a larger pool. And then each trait and tag you invoke is a justification for taking a die out of your pool to roll it. That way all dice are pool dice and you only really have to keep track of spent vs. unspent (which might be cool to have spots on the character sheet for). You'd have to lower the number of hits you need for a success of course. I still haven't quite thought this all the way through yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220200/#Comment_220200" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-22T15:15:17+00:00" title="July 22, 2009  3:15PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool stuff, Jeremy.<br/><br/>I've been fiddling around with alternate dice mechanics for LB, too.

I didn't have enough distinctive dice for 7 die pools, so I started them all out with 5 dice in their pools. I must say everyone was looking hard at their Keys after a couple of rolls, which really brought the awesome. <br/><br/>That being said, the idea of only having pool dice is interesting too. There is a free supers rpg called <a href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/above-the-earth" rel="nofollow">Above the Earth</a> where you start each session with 100d6, and when they are gone they are gone - although you get to keep any that roll ones to use later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
