In combat, you roll 2d10 vs. a fixed target number, and out of combat you roll 1d12 + Stat vs. the GM's 1d12 + Stat.<br/><br/>What I found interesting was how easy it would be to unify those mechanics.  Let's assume for a second that we can get away with squashing that d12 to a d10.  (to compensate, we <i>might</i> have to max the stats at +4, but I don't think it's really necessary).  <br/><br/>So we have:<br/><br/>1d10 + PC <b>vs</b> 1d10 + NPC<br/>= 1d10 - 1d10 + PC <b>vs</b> NPC<br/>= 2d10 - 11 + PC <b>vs</b> NPC<br/>= PC + 2d10 <b>vs</b> NPC + 11<br/><br/>So you have two situations:  PC's stat plus 2d10 vs. NPC's stat+11 (conflict resolution) and PC's attack modifiers plus 2d10 vs NPC's Target Number (combat).  You can also spin the armor target numbers into flat numeric bonuses, and give the PCs an armor roll of 2d10 vs. NPC's Target Number.  <br/><br/>If you do that, then you've got Players rolling all the dice and the GM's hands are free for notes, pantomime, and generally being really excited.  The GM isn't even tied down to the table if they can remember a few NPC / monster numbers.  I've occasionally found myself realizing after the scene that it's time to sit down again, because I've gotten so excited describing things that I'm on my feet gesturing and generally having a blast.  Those are my favorite scenes when gaming.<br/><br/>Now, the only problem is that this implementation breaks the monster talent Natural Weapons - now the players have to roll 3d10 and drop the best die, which is awkward.  So I'd house rule that.  But besides that I think it's a pretty good way to get all the math lining up in the same way.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125896/#Comment_125896" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-11T20:03:40+00:00" title="February 11, 2008  8:03PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure.

But clearly some people, like Ryan, prefer being free to focus on other stuff. Of course, if the math works out, you can just start with an assumption that both sides will roll dice in any conflict, and then give them the option of taking the average roll at any time. If the GM takes it, the PCs are rolling against a set target number. If the PCs take it, the GM is rolling against a set target number. If both take it, it's a simple higher-trait-wins game. Which, with expendable resources (like awesome points or whatever) can still be pretty fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125918/#Comment_125918" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-12T06:01:55+00:00" title="February 12, 2008  6:01AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah; if you really like rolling as a GM you can roll for both attack and defense for your monsters by running my math backwards (go from the 2d10 on the player side to the 1d10 on each side).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125979/#Comment_125979" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-12T11:18:57+00:00" title="February 12, 2008 11:18AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ryan,<br/><br/>In general, your method works.<br/><br/>But, watch out:<br/><br/>It's going to mess with the nice Awesome Token/Showing Off and Assist probabilities.
