The system works really great for player vs world, but what happens when players have conflict? What if they are both wrestling for the same artifact because it's evil influence has filled their hearts with greed? What happens when one of the players is replaced by a doppelganger and now that player is playing a monster?<br/><br/>Would love to hear your solutions!

Player A could then roll 10+ despite the -1 and, thus, get the opportunity to deal damage to player B. That means that player B suffers harm despite the fact that player B <b>rolled successfully</b>. Nothing else in the game works that way. <br/><br/>Alternatively, it could be hack&amp;slash vs. defy danger or hack&amp;slash vs. hack&amp;slash. But, in either case, what happens if both players roll 10+? If you strictly follow the language of the moves, they can't both succeed. <br/><br/>The issue is that the results of the moves are meant to create a single outcome. Competing sets of outcomes gum up the system. <br/><br/>I think the best way to do PvP is with a custom move, and further to treat each PvP as a high stakes unique situation. Hack&amp;slash and "dealing damage" is for fighting goblins and stuff like that. If you are dueling your best friend and fellow PC on a live volcano, the move should be <br/><br/><b>When you duel your best friend and fellow PC on a live volcano, roll Dex</b><br/>on a 10+ you get both of the following on a 7-9 choose 1 on a 6- your friend gets both: <br/>-- you are safe from lava and rockslides<br/>-- your friend's life is in your hands    <br/><br/>Or whatever. The point is that PvP should be a special situation -- the basic moves don't really apply. But the mechanics of "player vs. MC" should work the same in PvP as they do with the other moves. Anyway -- that's how my group has done it.   <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404336/#Comment_404336" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-23T16:00:45+00:00" title="January 23, 2013  4:00PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            AMB: There are plenty of cases where you might take damage without failing a roll.

It seems like a <b>hard move </b>should either follow a failure on the dice or a "golden opportunity." The red hot poker example seems like the latter. If the MC can just ding players with no mechanical cause or fictional heads-up, then what is the point of having rules in the first place? That said, I don't disagree with you exactly regarding the inherent danger of PC life, I just don't think that the basic moves are built for PvP, and mashing them together willy nilly creates clunky results. A fellow player's success is not really the same as an MC's hard move. Using one player move against another is, if anything, a bigger drift of the rules than a custom move would be (unless, of course, I'm wrong and simply haven't read the applicable chapter in one of the books. :P) Ultimately, though, I'm just saying what our group has done, so YMMV.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404339/#Comment_404339" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-23T16:31:27+00:00" title="January 23, 2013  4:31PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 23, 2013 4:32PM by John_Harper.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I use the standard AW and DW rules for PvP and they work very well for me and the people I play with.

Be very scrupulous, GM, especially with the timing of actions and step through everything with care.<br/><br/>(Very often, the GM move <i>turn their move back on them</i> is all you need. One person misses, and you simply give the target PC that move with a 10+ back at the first PC.)<br/><br/>Like everything else in the games, it's consequential and not at all safe.

It's weird that there should be a tacit assumption that a weakling wizard PC has a better chance of doing harm to me because when I fight him, my 10+ Hack&amp;Slash doesn't mean that I can avoid his puny fists. <br/><br/>I don't know. I can't really speak about Apocalypse World, but I still think weird stuff happens in Dungeon World if you use the player moves against each other. Maybe I'm doing something wrong. This issue came up several months ago on the Dungeon World forums . . . I'll repost what I said back then below. (I think I was playing a Beta version of the game at the time, but to the extent the following observations are still applicable, I'd appreciate any help sorting it out.)<br/><br/>. . .<br/><br/>Here's an example. Hotar, the evil Cleric PC is going to use the key of Obizmid to unleash a cruel demon on the realm. The only thing that stands between Hotar and imminent multi-planar catastrophe is the meek wizard Pol -- and Pol is wounded (1HP) and out of spells . . . <br/><br/>Hotar isn't in great shape either (1HP) and his god stopped listening to him some time ago, so now these friends become foes will fight to the death for the sake of all . . . no magics, no miracles, hand to hand, man to man. <br/><br/>Hotar STR 10 Bond w/Pol 0<br/><br/>Pol STR 8 Bond w/Hotar 3<br/><br/>If we say that Hotar is Interfering with Pol's Hack&amp;Slash move, and he rolls a 7 + 0 Bond, then Hotar stares cooly into Pol's eyes and intimidates the poor Wizard . . . Pol will suffer a -2 to his attack.<br/><br/>If Pol rolls a 7 Hack&amp;Slash, he gets a -2 because of Hotar's intimidation and another -1 because of his STR . . . that's a 4; I think that means that Hotar gets to punch Pol in the face . . . killing him. <br/><br/>Hotar uses the key to summon a demon and destroys the world. <br/><br/>On the other hand . . . <br/><br/>If Pol is interfering with Hotar's Hack&amp;Slash and he rolls a 7 he adds  his +3 Bond and gets a 10. Hotar remembers their friendship and hesitates in his evil plan -- taking a -2.<br/><br/>Hotar tries to punch Pol, rolls a 7 -2 =5 = failure. Pol punches Hotar . . . <br/><br/>and saves the world. <br/><br/>The Players BOTH said that they wanted to fight the other guy to the death. In the fiction they do the SAME thing, but depending on the GM's MECHANICAL decision about which one is Interfering and which one is Hacking and Slashing, the entire universe is either saved or destroyed given the exact same numbers on the dice. That's what bugs me. <br/><br/>GM vs. Player move is all about fictional decisions, player vs. player is about math because BOTH sides are rolling dice. <br/><br/>No? <br/><b><br/>This is AMBayard in 2013 -- after this post, some people disagreed with me . . . and the next post followed.</b><br/><br/>When one PC succeeds in a Hack and Slash move and deals damage to another PC, it means that the victim PC is taking harm even if the victim PC did not fail a roll. And, that's weird. It's weird because the moves are designed with consequences built in. The moves assume that the adversary is an NPC and not another player. If you defy danger in response to GM danger, you defy it; if you blow your roll, you get hit. The GM never rolls. The moves do not seem well equipped to deal with a situation when the adversary is ALSO rolling dice and might succeed in dealing damage to you whether or not you are successful. For that reason, it's problematic to treat PC on PC violence as if it's any other situation. It's not the same. <br/><br/>I think the solution Sage provided would work. Everyone makes a call and decides that one guy is Interfering and the other guy is Hack and Slashing. Fine. But, that decision really does give an objective advantage to one player or the other (see Hotar and Pol). The player with the low STR would much rather make the Interfere move, but why should he get to? What if his manner of interference is "hitting the guy with a frying pan"? You guys talked about "who goes first" and who is "defending," but from the point of view of the players, they are BOTH reacting to stimuli the way that they always do -- sequence doesn't matter. They are just making a move. The question isn't "who goes first," it's "which move is arbitrarily assigned to whom?" And, somebody is getting screwed by the mechanics.<br/><br/>But, still, I'm not saying it wouldn't work. It would work. It's just not fair to somebody. <br/><br/>There are probably other solutions too. I was thinking it might be a good idea to say that a player cannot deal damage to another on their own roll. Like, if player A rolls a 10 in a Hack &amp; Slash against player B, player A should still "succeed" but the GM should narrate some fictional advantage or benefit.

I think the moves are about spotlight in the fiction... When a player is rolling for a move, that moment is about his character, he's the center of it, and whoever wants to intervene does it from a secondary position (during that instant): either by helping or interfering with his action. During this game characters don't take in-game turns to act, they take turns to fictional spotlight, I guess, and yes, when you have the spotlight it is all about what you're doing and it's more important to see what YOU can pull off to do that amazing feat, and that's by design I guess. If you further analize the rules, you'll see more weird cases, like 2 character at -1str fighting each other. In that case, it's more convenient to let the other roll, so he fails and you get a hard move against them, isn't it? But I don't think that's a game failure, that's intentional and it works great.<br/><br/>Also, there's other thing. Of course it's different to fight against a goblin NPC instead of a weakling mage PC. That's because that weakling mage PC is a protagonist in the story, the only MAGE in it, in fact (remember, anyone might be called mage, but yours is the only MAGE), and so his player gets more say about how he affects you than a goblin NPC, who is merely fodder to your story.<br/>And that's again because again, I think, moves reflect fiction spotlight, narration rights and genre logic rather than in-game physichs.<br/><br/>If you don't like that, there are other awesome games with common opposed rolls like the shadow of yesterday.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404351/#Comment_404351" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-23T19:50:12+00:00" title="January 23, 2013  7:50PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 23, 2013 7:51PM by John_Harper.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/AMBayard">@AMBayard</a>: Okay, I see several gaps in understanding here, mainly regarding the fiction-first nature of the games.<br/><br/>First, the GM doesn't "assign moves arbitrarily." Moves are triggered by specific fictional actions, not assigned. And the GM makes principled (not arbitrary) decisions according to her agenda and principles. The situation is not "we're both rolling hack and slash!" There are specific actions being performed in the fiction, and those actions trigger moves (or not) according to a fictional sequence. If you don't know the actions and sequence, the fiction is too vague for the mechanics to kick in.<br/><br/>Second, the Wizard doesn't "get to" roll H&amp;S when he tries to punch the Fighter, just because his player wants to. Fiction comes first, and the fiction triggers the move. Them's the rules. I'm sure you've seen the example of the Fighter who wants to H&amp;S the Dragon using a normal sword. He doesn't automatically get to roll that, since the fiction doesn't match the trigger for the move. Same thing with the untrained, unarmed Wizard taking a wild swing at the Fighter.<br/><br/>Does the fiction-first rule make sense? I want to make sure we're on the same page with that before trying to explain any further.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404354/#Comment_404354" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-23T21:52:17+00:00" title="January 23, 2013  9:52PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 23, 2013 9:58PM by noclue.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>The Players BOTH said that they wanted to fight the other guy to the death.

Maybe I don't. However there are definitely a few places where I don't think we're all on the same page, so let me try to clarify (maybe we all actually agree) . . . <br/><br/>First, I don't want to get bogged down by the idea of "arbitrarily assigning moves." I understand that the rules do <b>not</b> call for arbitrary assignment of moves. I understand that moves are triggered by the fictional actions of the characters. I agree with <a href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">@ChristopherWeeks</a>, that there <b>shouldn't</b> ever be an arbitrary assignment of moves. When I asked: "which move is arbitrarily assigned to whom?" I was not stating my view of how the game should correctly operate. I meant to illustrate what I view as a <b>problem</b> with PvP in Dungeon World . . . that is, typically, the GM is <b>not supposed to</b> arbitrarily assign moves, but in PvP, it seems like (unless Deliverator and I are confused) the arbitrary assignment of moves is the unintended problematic consequence of one proposed solution to PvP. <br/><br/>Here are some illustrations:<br/><br/><b>Case 1 -- How it normally works -- Typical Player vs. Monster situation </b><br/><br/>GM: Goblin soldier swings his knife toward your throat! What do you do?!<br/><br/>Player Cleric: I run him through with my sword! <br/><br/>GM: Your fictional action "attacking an enemy in melee" triggers the move Hack&amp;Slash. Roll + Str.<br/><br/>Player (rolls a 10!): On a 10+ I deal my damage and avoid their attack! Hooray!<br/><br/><b>Case 2 -- PvP Combat! -- Option in which both players use Hack&amp;Slash</b><br/><br/>Player Cleric (speaking to Player Wizard): "We are both out of spells. We are nearly dead. Though once friends, we are now enemies, and the fate of the world depends on which one of us leaves this volcano alive." <br/><br/>Player Wizard: "I agree with you. On the count of 3 we will duel to the death! 1 . . . "<br/><br/>Player Cleric: 2 . . . <br/><br/>Players Wizard and Cleric in unison: THREE!!<br/><br/>GM: What do you do?<br/><br/>Player Cleric: I punch him as hard as I can. <br/><br/>Player Wizard: I punch him as hard as I can. <br/><br/>GM: Your fictional actions "attacking an enemy in melee" triggers the move Hack&amp;Slash. Role + Str. <br/><br/>Players Wizard and Cleric in unison: I ROLL A 12! On a 10+ I deal my damage and avoid their attack . . . wait . . . how can I both avoid their attack and simultaneously not avoid their attack? According to the result of the other player's roll, they get to deal their damage. Do we avoid each other? Do we hit each other? The results of our rolls are inconsistent. What do we do?<br/><br/>GM: Er . . . <br/><br/><b>Case 3 -- PvP Combat -- Option in which one player uses Hack&amp;Slash and the other uses Interfere </b><br/><br/>GM: What do you do?<br/><br/>Player Cleric: I punch him as hard as I can. <br/><br/>Player Wizard: I punch him as hard as I can. <br/><br/>GM: It sounds like one of you is using the fictional action "attacking an enemy in melee" which triggers the move Hack&amp;Slash. Role + Str. The other one is Interfering. <br/><br/>Players: Okay, but if the Wizard with a low Str and a high Bond is using Hack&amp;Slash, he will be at a disadvantage; if, on the other hand, the Wizard uses Interfere, he will be at an advantage. Who make what move? <br/><br/>GM: Fiction first! The fiction will tell us! What are you doing? <br/><br/>Players: Simultaneously punching each other . . .<br/><br/>GM: Oh . . . then I guess I'll have to . . . gulp . . . assign Hack&amp;Slash to one of you . . . though it goes against every fiber of my being to arbitrarily assign moves . . . <br/><br/>See, the problem, in my view, is that the moves are awesome in Case 1 because the outcomes of the moves *including the action of the adversary* are baked into the move. It does not work as well when both sides are rolling. Or, anyway, even if it does work, it's objectively mechanically different than the ordinary Case 1 situation, and there are results that can be confusing.   \n<blockquote>The assumption is both players simultaneously attack each other and the GM arbitrarily decides who's interfering. Dollars to donuts that's not how it goes down. Someone's gonna throw the first punch. In the rare instance where it's truly impossible to tell, then no one's interfering. Trade harm and move on.</blockquote>\n"Who goes first" isn't really the issue. In Case 2 and Case 3 above, I make them punch at the same time just for the sake of clarity, but in the Case 1 above, the goblin soldier ostensibly, "went first" in the fiction, but the player still got to roll Hack&amp;Slash. Your solution of trading damage and moving on is totally fine, and I agree. That is essentially the same as my "make a custom move" solution, but that's not the same as "just use the rules as they are written."\n<blockquote>If the players were being persistent about setting up a scientifically calibrated, precision punch-trading system where they were ensuring that the timing was exactly equal (rather than some vaguely realistic progression in the fiction), I'd just let them each deal one HP simultaneously and go find a reasonable group."</blockquote>\nI don't think it's a matter of being precise. The problem is that when the adversary is an NPC monster, the GM doesn't roll anything and there is no option of "interfering" with the Monster. So, the standard "what does the fiction tell me" analysis is <b>at least </b>different in the context of PvP if not problematic.  <br/><br/>Ultimately, the OP wanted to know how people handle PvP. It seems like the two camps are, "use the rules as written" and "make up a custom move for PvP moments." I actually think that BOTH options work fine 99% of the time, and both have drawbacks. As a practical matter, it might be easier to just use the rules as they are written, and ignore what I see as some of the issues (especially if my issues as described above are misguided). But, I don't think it's silly to say that there are moments that call for a custom move, and PvP might be among them.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/3Jane" title="3Jane"><img alt="3Jane" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/3Jane">3Jane</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404385/#Comment_404385" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-24T09:33:43+00:00" title="January 24, 2013  9:33AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>GM: What do you do?<br/><br/>Player Cleric: I punch him as hard as I can. <br/><br/>Player Wizard: I punch him as hard as I can.</blockquote>\nI never actually played AW (just tremulus), so I don't have a good solution.<br/><br/>However in your example, Cleric shot... oops punched first.

As you point out, it's not a matter of who talks first and loudest. There is no "initiative" in Dungeon World in part because the results of the moves resolve the question of who is in position to do damage. And, anyway, like I said above, it's not really important which character makes the first twitch in the fiction (see my response to noclue and Case 1). Even if both players quietly wait for the GM to address them individually to determine which one gets to make the choice of moves -- that means the GM is giving the advantage to one player or the other.

Role + Str. The other one is Interfering. <br/><br/>Players: Okay, but if the Wizard with a low Str and a high Bond is using Hack&amp;Slash, he will be at a disadvantage; if, on the other hand, the Wizard uses Interfere, he will be at an advantage. Who make what move? <br/><br/>GM: Fiction first! The fiction will tell us! What are you doing? <br/><br/>Players: Simultaneously punching each other . . .<br/><br/>GM: Oh . . . then I guess I'll have to . . . gulp . . . assign Hack&amp;Slash to one of you . . . though it goes against every fiber of my being to arbitrarily assign moves . . . </blockquote>\nIn this case the fiction isn't clear. These two people, with no outside information, just decide to punch each other at the same time? That doesn't make much sense to me.<br/><br/>When the fiction isn't clear we refine until we know what's going on. So the GM might say "wait, cleric, why are you punching the wizard? What made you decide to do that?" It's probably something like "that's the last straw, I'm not letting him defile my sanctuary any more!" or "he took the mace, which was going to be mine!" That establishes what's happening.<br/><br/>Now we go back to the wizard. Going by the fiction it's probably pretty clear if the wizard knows the cleric is about to sock him; the most likely situation is the wizard sees it coming. So the GM might say "Avon, you see Delia coming at you with a clenched fist, what do you do?"<br/><br/>Now Avon's action might cause a number of moves to trigger:<br/><br/>"We can't fight here, it'll break the enchantment! I throw my hands up and back away!" GM asks Delia what she does, if she follows through she just punches him, no roll (no melee).<br/><br/>"I duck out of the way and make off with the mace!" Avon's defying the danger of Delia, Delia is interfering. <br/><br/>"I slug her right back!" Delia's hack and slashing Avon (assuming her punch has a reasonable chance of doing damage, in the fiction), Avon is interfering.<br/><br/>Depending on their bonds and stats some of these things may be considerably better or worse for them, or considerably different than doing the same thing against an angry guard NPC. That's fine! These are two people who know each other well, they don't just fight like combatants. It's like fighting your sibling: it's as much about how much you know them.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard" title="AMBayard"><img alt="AMBayard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard">AMBayard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404392/#Comment_404392" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-24T10:59:55+00:00" title="January 24, 2013 10:59AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I think this is not a problem with the structure of *W rules in general, but rather, an ambiguity with <i>hack and slash</i> in particular.

That's fine! </blockquote> (some content omitted)<br/><br/>Okay, so in your Avon/Delia fight. You agree that if Delia was an NPC goblin, and Avon said the <b>exact same thing</b> he says in your example -- "I slug her right back!" -- the correct move for Avon would be Hack&amp;Slash because there is no Interfere when you are fighting NPC goblins. The characters in the fiction don't know the difference between PCs and NPCs, they are just fictional characters. Yet, in your example where the <b>fictional action </b> is the same "I slug her right back" -- Avon's <b>move</b> is different. In PvP it becomes Interfere rather than Hack&amp;Slash. <br/><br/>Moreover, the one who is Hack&amp;Slashing and the one who is Interfering is determined by who the GM happens to address first -- somewhat arbitrarily. The GM could have asked Avon "what do you do?" and then it would be Delia Interfering. The GM's choice in that case puts a thumb on the scale in favor of one player or the other.

Avon, what do you do about that?"

In the example you give, Case 2/3, where the Wizard and Cleric are both out of resources, and they're both on the verge of death (1 HP each), and they know that whoever leaves this volcano will get the Orb of Whosibiwhatsis and will reshape the world as they wish...and they were once allies and they respect each other, so they're going to fight honorably...so they count down from 3, and on 0, they will strike at each other, and whoever remains standing, gets the Orb...<br/><br/>My first instinct is they're just hitting each other, not resisting, not dodging. So they're just trading harm, plain and simple. It's not a hack and slash, because what they're actually, physically doing is nothing more than striking each other. How could either one miss? How could they avoid harm? So, everybody roll harm, and that's what happens. <br/><br/>But each has only 1 HP. So this will end them both. Maybe that's okay for you, maybe it's not. <br/><br/>If it's not, my next step is to say, well, what are they <i>really</i> doing? They're both punching each other, they're both dealing damage...but what's really going on is that they're both worn, weary, hurt, and trying to stay up. That's what's going on here. Not the punch -- the attempt to remain standing, to resist.<br/><br/>So what they're actually both doing is Defying Danger with Constitution.<br/><br/>All of which is to echo everything everyone else has been saying. I think the situation can be resolved using the rules and principles of Dungeon World and the fictional context. Trading harm as established may not be a roll-dice move, but it's still in the DW rules.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan_Conway" title="Brendan_Conway"><img alt="Brendan_Conway" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan_Conway">Brendan_Conway</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404398/#Comment_404398" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-24T11:59:08+00:00" title="January 24, 2013 11:59AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Okay, assume two PCs a cleric and a wizard.

What are they doing? <br/><br/>These things will answer the question of "How do the mechanics work?"</blockquote>\nGood questions. We're assuming both of the characters want to engage in melee to the death. They want to fight. Let's give them swords. If asked to be more specific, both will say, "I swing my sword and try to kill him while simultaneously avoiding any blows -- you know, just like I did in my previous duel with the goblin soldier." If pressed further, "both will say they swing for the body of the other." <br/><br/>So, who rolls Hack&amp;Slash and who rolls to Interfere? Who makes that call? They are doing the same thing at the same time.  <br/><br/>Alternatively, if your answer is "they both take damage" -- that's a fine answer, but that means that PC vs. PC has a different mechanical result than PC vs. NPC. Because in PC vs. NPC, the player rolls Hack&amp;Slash and has the opportunity to avoid harm.<br/><br/>If your answer is that they both roll Hack&amp;Slash, then that's fine too, but what happens when they both get a 10+? The results of that move are in conflict.  <br/><br/>For that matter, what happens when one player succeeds in Hack&amp;Slash and the other succeeds in Defy Danger? Those results conflict too. <br/><br/>My only point with all of this is that PCvPC hand to hand battles are not just fictionally different from PC vs. NPC, but mechanically different than the standard Player move in reaction to soft GM move.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TildeSee" title="TildeSee"><img alt="TildeSee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TildeSee">TildeSee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404402/#Comment_404402" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-24T12:12:12+00:00" title="January 24, 2013 12:12PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 24, 2013 12:14PM by TildeSee.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                             ;-) and of the answer is that they both ate throwing a punch at the other's face simultaneously, neither of them are particularly engaging in melee, and so they just deal harm.

In the example you give, Case 2/3, where the Wizard and Cleric are both out of resources, and they're both on the verge of death (1 HP each), and they know that whoever leaves this volcano will get the Orb of Whosibiwhatsis and will reshape the world as they wish...and they were once allies and they respect each other, so they're going to fight honorably...so they count down from 3, and on 0, they will strike at each other, and whoever remains standing, gets the Orb...<br/><br/>My first instinct is they're just hitting each other, not resisting, not dodging. So they're just trading harm, plain and simple. It's not a hack and slash, because what they're actually, physically doing is nothing more than striking each other. How could either one miss? How could they avoid harm? So, everybody roll harm, and that's what happens. <br/><br/>But each has only 1 HP. So this will end them both. Maybe that's okay for you, maybe it's not. <br/><br/>If it's not, my next step is to say, well, what are they <i>really</i> doing? They're both punching each other, they're both dealing damage...but what's really going on is that they're both worn, weary, hurt, and trying to stay up. That's what's going on here. Not the punch -- the attempt to remain standing, to resist.<br/><br/>So what they're actually both doing is Defying Danger with Constitution.<br/><br/>All of which is to echo everything everyone else has been saying. I think the situation can be resolved using the rules and principles of Dungeon World and the fictional context. Trading harm as established may not be a roll-dice move, but it's still in the DW rules. </blockquote>\nI think that's a great analysis of the situation. And, your instincts would totally work. However, I think you are focusing on my inartful variables in order to avoid confronting the issue I'm raising. So, yes, all the stuff you said makes sense. But, what do you do when two PCs want to fight? At the same time. It's a duel. It happens in fiction all the time. I mean, I guess the answer may always simply be "look for an excuse in the fiction to avoid a head on sword to sword battle," but for the sake of the thought experiment, let's let them fight. They aren't standing there ready to take the other guy's punch. They are fighting -- they are fighting the same way they fight monsters -- only this time, it's another PC. Nobody is going first. Nobody is being sneaky. They are fighting.

Goblin, y'know. Wasn't as much of a problem to hit him and simultaneously keep out of reach. So, right now, you're lunging forward, swinging your sword at the Cleric, an overhead strike, point coming down in an arc at his head, and you're keeping your body in profile to him, to try to minimize the risk. Right? <br/><br/>Wizard: No, I'm doing a horizontal arc at his body.<br/><br/>DM: Okay, cool.

In your example, first you ask the wizard what he's doing. Sums up as "attacking the cleric, slashing away with my sword." We know nothing about the cleric, so that's not triggering any move, but depending on what's happening with the cleric, it might. So, continuing on with your example, you ask the cleric what he's doing. "attacking the wizard, slashing away with my sword." This time, though, the conversation is different. Because we know what's going on with the wizard, we've got a move being triggered. The wizard is coming at the cleric, and the cleric is engaging the wizard (who is attacking him) in melee. Cleric rolls hack and slash.<br/><br/>I'm bowing out, until I can bang out my big theory-post, but I hope this helps with where I come from on this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TildeSee" title="TildeSee"><img alt="TildeSee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TildeSee">TildeSee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404414/#Comment_404414" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-24T13:07:17+00:00" title="January 24, 2013  1:07PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (totally thought Brendan's post was yours.

We decide what moves are triggered depending on the fiction, yes?  And the fiction in this case is largely determined by the narration of the players?  But now let's say we have two players who are competing with each other (at player level, not character level) over who gets to narrate what's going on.

Still, it can definitely happen, even amongst the most well-meaning players if they get heavily invested in the outcomes.

I feel like that solution of asking questions to further define what exactly is happening until you know who's rolling what is what I'm trying to enunciate, and it would preclude two PCs rolling H&amp;S at the same time.<br/><br/>In response to your second point, about my method being to "keep PvP almost entirely fictional," I think I have to take a step back. That is where there's a difference of approach between our perspectives. I think that the entire game of Dungeon World is kept almost entirely fictional, so I don't make a distinction for PvP, or for there being a "solution" to PvP that involves keeping it mostly fictional. I play PvP the same way I'd play anything else.<br/><br/>In a PC vs NPC situation, "attacking" the NPC is never that simple.<br/><br/>Warrior: I'm attacking the goblin. Rah!<br/><br/>DM: Great. What exactly are you doing?<br/><br/>Warrior: I'm swinging my sword at it.<br/><br/>DM: Charging? Overhead strike?<br/><br/>Warrior: One of those anime things, where I'm dragging the sword point along the cave floor until I bring it up suddenly and cut the Goblin in half. Can I do that?<br/><br/>DM: Sure! That's awesome! (Checks his custom Goblin moves, sees one that says "Scurry away like insect.") It doesn't sound like a Hack &amp; Slash to me, though. If you hit this thing, it's gonna get cut in two. The real issue is, y'know, if you hit it. You're charging it down, and this thing starts moving with insect speed, trying to scurry up a wall and away from you. Defy Danger with Dex, the danger being that it gets away from you, to see if you connect.<br/><br/>Or...<br/><br/>Warrior: I'm attacking the goblin. Rah!<br/><br/>DM: Great. What exactly are you doing?<br/><br/>Warrior: Where is it?<br/><br/>DM: It's a good 8 feet away from you, glaring at you.<br/><br/>Warrior: Right. I'll advance on it slowly, my sword out in one hand, shield held in the other, and once I'm in striking distance, I'll cautiously take a few stabs at it.<br/><br/>DM: Fantastic! (Checks custom Goblin moves, sees one that says "Fight like a demon.") You're advancing towards the Goblin with cautious pace, and it's just glaring at you with these yellow eyes, full of hate. It raises its own axe in two hands, and it stands ready for you. Once you've come closer, its mouth drops, and it lets out this terrible, jabbering yell, and before you know it, the thing is hacking and chopping at you with the axe like crazy. <br/><br/>Warrior: I'm stabbing it! I'm stabbing it!<br/><br/>DM: That's totally a Hack &amp; Slash.<br/><br/><br/>So the way I think DW is supposed to run is that it's always, always mostly fiction. When it's not mostly fiction is when it starts to fall apart.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404419/#Comment_404419" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-24T13:38:34+00:00" title="January 24, 2013  1:38PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 24, 2013 1:48PM by Zachary_Wolf.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            See, this discussion feels a little bit like <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?PHPSESSID=onom1nsvu4aur2sslckv1s0uebh94ero&amp;topic=6012.0" rel="nofollow">this one</a>.

But let's humor it.<br/><br/>In the situation with the simultaneous punch, the answer has already been given - exchange harm for harm. They both attack simultaneously and neither is defending, so they both knock each other's lights out. Let's think about this though.<br/><br/>Hotar is clearly at a disadvantage given the situation. Pol just needs to do damage to Hotar and technically he wins (it doesn't really matter if Pol gets knocked out as a result since he isn't the one trying to do something). Hotar needs to deal damage to Pol AND not take damage in the process (because he's the one actually trying to do something other then fight). So, if they both decide to throw a punch, Pol wins, even though they both take the damage and fall over unconscious. Given that logic, Hotar probably should defend himself rather then throw a punch.<br/><br/>Then we have the issue of PC vs PC doesn't work the same as PC vs Monster. I think it's kind of expected that PVP and PVE are two different creatures. The Player Characters are special - they aren't just monsters or NPCs. Never should we compare PC's attacking each other to a PC attacking a monster - they're fundamentally different according to the rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan_Conway" title="Brendan_Conway"><img alt="Brendan_Conway" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan_Conway">Brendan_Conway</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404420/#Comment_404420" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-24T13:40:58+00:00" title="January 24, 2013  1:40PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Has anyone come across events like this in play?  How have you handled it?</blockquote>\nHere's my take, not sure it's right.<br/><br/>Each player has direct control over what their PC does, and that's it. So when the DM asks "What do you do?", each player gets to say, "I hit him with my axe!" or whatever. Then, the DM gets to ask questions, until the DM feels confident enough to say, "Great, here's what happens," or, "Great, you triggered a move, here you go." If the player would rather say, "I Hack &amp; Slash!", then it's the DM's job to say, "Great! How?" And keep asking questions until it's clear. With the other point that the DM can say, "Hmmm, well if that's what you're doing, it doesn't sound like a Hack &amp; Slash, it sounds like a Defend, actually." <br/><br/>Each player can only give him or herself a mechanical advantage through fictional actions. Each player can only control his or her own direct fictional actions, in response to the DM's "What do you do?" So, if they want mechanical advantage, they'll have to describe what they're doing, and that has to be something that will, indeed, put them at advantage. And the other player can say, "I stop him!" and interfere with the first player doing something fictionally that will put them at a mechanical advantage, but can't say, "Nuh-uh, you don't do that!"<br/><br/>I'm not sure I made sense.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404423">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard" title="AMBayard"><img alt="AMBayard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard">AMBayard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404423/#Comment_404423" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-24T13:48:20+00:00" title="January 24, 2013  1:48PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Brendan_Conway">@Brendan_Conway</a>: I dig. Though, one of the things I think is really great about DungeonWorld is that you can zoom in -- as you described -- and account for the blow by blow details of a sword fight accounting for all the nuance. But, you can also zoom out and describe an hour long brawl with a single roll. That works too. I don't think there is anything wrong with abstracting a fight to "they grappled and bit and stabbed and bled until dawn" and moving on to a more significant event if the players aren't particularly interested in the moment to moment details.

In fact, it seems, that I'm on the extreme end of this point of view to the point that when PC fights PC, I treat each case as a unique snowflake custom move.

The player moves are reactions to the GM's soft moves. The player move is the plug and the GM's move is the outlet. The GM's call to action of "what do you do?!" works best if it follows a GM move -- if it follows another player's move, then you are bumping plugs. <br/><br/>Aid or Interfere has the mechanical effect of hurting or helping another player's roll, but it is still a reaction to a GM's move. <br/><br/>I really don't think my issue is that I'm not putting the fiction first. The problem is that the mechanical results of the player moves only make sense in response to GM moves. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404444">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404444/#Comment_404444" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-24T15:20:32+00:00" title="January 24, 2013  3:20PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 24, 2013 3:21PM by Zachary_Wolf.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Of course -- debate ensued after that version too, so maybe it's not more helpful . . . :P</blockquote>\n<img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>I mean, I don't want anyone to feel like they're just getting shot down over and over again, but yeah, there really isn't a good example of the problem.

In that one percent where the characters are acting simultaneously, doing the exact same thing, and with perfectly balanced statistics in the background, then I'd do this: Tell them they either both succeed, or they both fail. It doesn't matter who answers first, because if either of them say "Succeed" then they both do it and suffer consequences, otherwise if both of them say "Fail" then it's a stalemate and they clash swords and they remain stalemated until someone does something different than the other, in which case it's no longer a 1% situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404451/#Comment_404451" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-24T15:43:32+00:00" title="January 24, 2013  3:43PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 24, 2013 3:45PM by Paul_T.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like that, Zachary_Wolf.<br/><br/>Here's another thing that I think should plastered on every *W game ever:<br/><br/>"If you ever feel like you should be rolling some dice and you're not sure what to do, it means the players are looking at you to say something, right? So look over the rules again: any time the players look at you like it's your turn to talk, make an MC move."<br/><br/>Coming from other games, it often often feels like, "Hey, shouldn't I be rolling some dice here? But I don't know which."<br/><br/>If you don't know which, it means there's probably no move being triggered. So go and make an MC move instead, then ask "what do you do?"<br/><br/>Offer an opportunity with or without cost is a good one. So is announce future badness (or whatever it's called in DW). <br/><br/>Here's a possibly relevant conversation I had here a while back about AW PvP: <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/13409/apocalypse-world-just-a-couple-of-questions" rel="nofollow">Link</a><br/><br/>As for custom moves, the AW move Seize by Force works pretty well for an even fight: both players roll, and apply the options as written. (There's just one exchange of harm, though, not two.) Both can interfere if they want and it makes sense in the fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard" title="AMBayard"><img alt="AMBayard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard">AMBayard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404454/#Comment_404454" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-24T15:53:46+00:00" title="January 24, 2013  3:53PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, there are a zillion solutions really. And, numerous really good ones have been identified in this thread. Which is probably great since that was the OP's question in the first place. <br/><br/>My issue isn't that it's impossible to sort out a PvP fight. It's totally possible. My issue is that it's mechanically different than a normal fight, and the way to handle it is not super obvious (to me anyway -- it seems obvious to virtually everyone else). The second you even consider <b>"who is the instigator?"</b>, you've already departed from standard operating procedure for virtually every other move, because typically the instigator will be an NPC swinging a club -- and the <b>reacting PC </b>will roll Hack&amp;Slash if he swings his sword <b>in response</b>. In the most popular PC vs. PC suggestion, it is the instigating PC who rolls Hack&amp;Slash and the reacting PC who rolls to Interfere -- which is weird to me for reasons detailed upthread. <br/><br/>(Also, arguably, isn't the Hack&amp;Slashing PC Interfering with the Interfering PC's Interfering move? -- Eep! :P)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404457/#Comment_404457" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-24T16:10:20+00:00" title="January 24, 2013  4:10PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 24, 2013 4:10PM by noclue.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, the case where both players stand there and count to three before simultaneously striking each other is one of those exceedingly rare instances where the move order isn't clear and I'd probably trade harm. For all other times where the cleric and the thief have actual motivations asking questions and listening will generally sort things out. <br/><br/>Cleric: I run for the evil doohickey and rule the world!<br/>Thief: oh no he didn't! I block the doorway and shove him back.<br/>GM: sounds like you're Defending the door way. Roll.<br/>Cleric: Well, I stab the bastard.<br/>GM: that's a hack and slash.

How do the mechanics work? </b></blockquote>\nSorry, I'm skipping reading some posts here as my day has been crazy.<br/><br/>That's all established, let's pick up here:<br/><br/>GM: The emperor bellows "begin" from his throne. Who acts first?<br/><br/>We've already got branching situations here. I can see two options: 1) Pol (or Hotar) says "I do!" or  2) they both say "I do!"<br/><br/>1) is easy: you ask them what they do, the action gets responded to (or not), moves start triggering.<br/><br/>2) just requires clarifying the fiction. The GM will ask questions like "Pol, what were you doing before the action started?" Assuming an otherwise balanced fictional situation, the GM would ask about who's DEX is higher\u2014the stats are part of the fictional situation too! In the case that they're tied in DEX (and Dexterity) the GM might ask for WIS (and Wisdom) to see who's senses are sharper. Basically there are a huge number of differentiators here: where each character is, what they're doing before the start is called, their stats, their weapons, etc.<br/><br/>In most situations something is going to differentiate them: their weapon range, their stats, how they set themselves up before the action begins, etc. There is the potential for a situation where all these things are 100% tied, but it's unlikely. You're pushing for edges here, so let's assume Pol and Hotar have the exact same stats, fictional positioning, heigh (which would otherwise make their reach in the physical sense different), etc. This is pretty unlikely to come up, but we'll run with it.<br/><br/>The situation here is summed up by the GM like this: "Woah, Pol and Hotar are exactly evenly matched here, crazy! Let's rewind a second\u2014Pol and Hotar, before the emperor calls the action, you can tell you're both even here, is either of you doing anything to cheat?"<br/><br/>Again this is likely to differentiate the situation, but not guaranteed. We can still end up with them both acting at the same time.<br/><br/>If they're both attacking at the same time and both able to defend themselves they both roll hack and slash. The results happen at the same time\u2014if Pol rolls a 10+ and her damage is enough to kill Hotar, but Hotar also rolls a hit, Pol still takes Pol's damage.<br/><br/>Why no interfere? Because nobody said anything about interfering with the other person's action! You don't get interfere for free just because you're a PC.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404469/#Comment_404469" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-24T17:44:32+00:00" title="January 24, 2013  5:44PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just for the record:\n<blockquote>My issue is that it's mechanically different than a normal fight, and the way to handle it is not super obvious (to me anyway -- it seems obvious to virtually everyone else).<br/></blockquote>\nYou are very wrong about that last part. Lots of people get confused by this, and for the precise reasons you mention. (Just look on the AW forums!)<br/><br/>I think the *W games give you good tools to find a solution, but they don't spell it out very well. There's lots of room to make mistakes or to mis-apply the rules.<br/><br/>And if you're expecting a "fair" fight between two PCs which doesn't involve judgement calls on the part of the MC, that's just not going to happen, so be ready to go home disappointed. (Or make a custom move, of course.)<br/><br/>The *W games are very old-school that way: the call on the MC to make rulings and rule calls as a "referee", and hope the rest of the group is on board with that. <br/><br/>The choice of moves at any given point is how the MC modifies the relative odds of success or failure (since the MC generally does not assign difficulty numbers, bonuses, or penalties).<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/3Jane" title="3Jane"><img alt="3Jane" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/3Jane">3Jane</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404504/#Comment_404504" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-25T05:46:38+00:00" title="January 25, 2013  5:46AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 25, 2013 5:47AM by 3Jane.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm ready to go home disappointed, as I dislike the situation where depending on how a GM makes a judgement call they give advantage to one player over the other.

Like, Attacker trying to achieve fictional positioning to auto-kill Victim: "So, once everyone else is asleep, I quietly roll over and cut his throat." at which point Victim goes: "However, on this night, I also pretended to be asleep and thus am fully awake when you try to stab me and scream MURDERER! waking everyone up."

Phrasing it without contextual fiction may make it hard to answer, but I'd love to hear whatever you have to say.<br/><br/>What, exactly, happens at each intersection of "Both hack and slash simultaneously"? I think that having some kind of "official" explanation of what you think happens, on a purely mechanical level could help.<br/><br/>Personally, my take was always to ask questions until it became clear what each PC was really doing, such that they weren't both hacking and slashing. But you say that it's a valid option. So could you explain? <br/><br/><b>Player A rolls a 10+ and Player B rolls a 10+: </b>This is the most confusing one, I think. Both players have a result that says they can choose to not get attacked, or get attacked and deal +1d6 damage. So...how does this one work? Ignore the +1d6 option, and they both deal damage to each other? Neither deals damage to the other? Give them the option of either taking no damage and dealing no damage, or dealing damage + 1d6?<br/><br/><b>Player A rolls a 10+ and Player B rolls a 7-9 (and vice versa):</b> This one is a little bit simpler, but still odd. Player B is taking damage, it seems, based on what both results say. But what about Player A? It seems that A would get to choose to either take damage and deal +1d6, or not take damage, but that undermines the results of B's roll. <br/><br/><b>Player A rolls a 10+ and Player B rolls a miss (and vice versa):</b> This one seems simple enough. A can choose to deal damage and take none, or deal +1d6 and take damage. Or maybe even you make the call that A can deal the +1d6 and still take no damage (hard move). Or something else (B gets disarmed, maybe -- similarly, hard move on a miss). <br/><br/><b>Player A rolls a 7-9 and Player B rolls a 7-9:</b> Both deal damage, both suffer damage. Simple enough.<br/><br/><b>Player A rolls a 7-9 and Player B rolls a miss (and vice versa):</b> Hmm. A little odd. A should be taking damage, but B missed. Maybe A deals damage, and B deals damage, but B gets another hard move, like above. Gets disarmed, gets knocked down, something like that.

I would probably choose the higher roll, since that is more likely to be the character which has better expertise at the action they are attempting (higher + to the roll).

The move says that on a 10+ you avoid the enemy attack. Why would the other PC's 10+ right to deal damage override my 10+ right to avoid damage? This conflicting results issue only comes up when you treat Player A's <b>Player move </b>as if it's a <b>GM move </b>.

If they get a 7-9 they stumble, hesitate, or flinch and the GM offers a worse outcome, hard bargain, or ugly choice. On a miss, the GM makes a move.

So when two players roll at the same time it's like</blockquote>\nThis is probably the most important part for me to internalize, and I'm really glad that you pointed it out. A hack &amp; slash roll is about your own attack, your own fighting, and about whether or not it opens you up to an attack -- and it's not really about the other combatant's attack. <br/><br/>Also, if I'm interpreting this correctly, <i>damn</i> does it hurt to go up against a fellow hero, when you risk taking damage twice, once from them successfully hitting you, and once from you being opened up to their attack. Seems like it'd go a long way to discourage straight-up beat-each-other-in-the-face combat between PCs. Which is a good thing! Instead, you get awesome maneuvering and acrobatics and tactics.
