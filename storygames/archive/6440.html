It's all good stuff, and I don't want to derail it.  But something he said sparked a "wait, that's not true..." response in me, so I want to put it up here in a separate thread. I've underlined the part that I disagree with.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The point being that in no other human endeavor called a "Game" does human judgment have so important an impact on the outcome as in a RPG.</span> Usually in games we do all we can to ensure that the rules can be dealt with in as objective a fashion as possible. In RPGs this simply isn't usually possible.</blockquote>\nI do want to add something that isn't meant as a tangent, but another avenue you could explore in order to gain some additional techniques or resources for building roleplaying games.<br/><br/>We have things called "reality tv shows" which are both games and competitions.  In the vast majority of these, human judgment is vitally important.  Shows like America's Next Top Model, Survivor, Top Chef, Beauty and the Geek, and Project Runway all incorporate both a competitive aspect and "game rules" based on subjective decisions.<br/><br/>The same phenomenon exists in other events -- such as beauty contests, or chili cook-offs, or dog shows.<br/><br/>What do these kinds of "games" or pseudo-games have to teach game designers about the role of subjective human judgment?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142716/#Comment_142716" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-06T14:04:50+00:00" title="May  6, 2008  2:04PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well art contests, as the ultimate example. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not sure what's to discuss, however. The only subject I can think of is whether or not checklists are helpful. In the game Primeval, where the GM rates player's versions of heroic events, and decides that the most entertaining of them is the one that occured (or at least is remembered), they had a checklist of things to score points on. Figure-skating seems to have some byzantine method for totalling points. And that's in an attempt to overcome the subjectivity that otherwise leads to the "Russian Judge" joke. <br/>\n<br/>\nGood idea, or bad? <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142723">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142723/#Comment_142723" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-06T14:23:53+00:00" title="May  6, 2008  2:23PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread title made me cringe, but there's something here... something about semi-prepped, semi-spontaneous...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142739/#Comment_142739" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-06T15:37:02+00:00" title="May  6, 2008  3:37PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The main thing I took away from reality shows is that an audience's investment really doesn't matter if a game is blatantly rigged - they like complaining about bad outcomes just as much as celebrating good ones.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142770/#Comment_142770" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-06T19:56:47+00:00" title="May  6, 2008  7:56PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Huh.

In fact not only do they manipulate the source material, but even more subtly, they provide unseen pressures that cause some of the drama. I saw a documentary on how some shows are made, and the way the producers manipulate the situations intent on causing drama - for the sake of making their show more interesting to watch - is fascinating. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo... how to apply that to RPGs? Well, perhaps as an object lesson. If your audience is your players, they're going to know they're being manipulated. So don't do that. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142973/#Comment_142973" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-07T16:43:53+00:00" title="May  7, 2008  4:43PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>I thought it was "Story is driven by overtly manipulative editing of the source material," but I'm at a loss as to how that can be applied in a gaming context.</blockquote>\nWell, that's what the mechanics do, right? The game mechanics are the editting process. Players are happy to be manipulated in certain ways when it's the rules doing it.<br/><br/>I refuse to accept that realty TV is in anyway similar to story games (or anything good and enjoyable) and it's silly to think reality TV inspired story games, as opposed to the disconnect between fiction and traditional RPGs, but Paul has some good parallells.  I think story games already do what reality TV tries to do - connect the audience with the feeling of something true - and the rest is pretty hard to accomplish: documenting real outrageous people reacting to (usually bizarre) situations for a chance at fame and money.<br/><br/>Various games already have judgement (XP rewards in many games, Fan Mail, Fate Points, etc) and competition (D&amp;D, Capes, Agon, etc) as a part of play.

The game mechanics are the editting process. <br/>Not really, no, unless your game mechanics are somehow taking everyone's contributions and in-character actions over the course of the game and then suddenly stripping them out of their original context and turning them into a different story entirely.  Reality shows are all about taking raw material (i.e., the stuff they film) and using it to manufacture a largely fictitious "drama" by selective editing and reordering.<br/><br/>(And maybe there's a game concept there, but it would be awfully memory-intensive and probably not much fun.
