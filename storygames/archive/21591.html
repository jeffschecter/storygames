It's definitely feature and not a bug. Use the fiction to sell the NPC's monstrous nature, instead, and wallow in colourful descriptions, character play, and fictional situations. (Especially consider how other NPCs react to or interact with this monster, to set the right tone.)</blockquote>\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/><b>How does conditions works and affect the player/npc?</b><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EXAMPLE: 1 of my players tried to shut down the bully in front of the whole class. <br/>Result? 6 or less.<br/>He got a voice crack while saying it and all the class started to laugh</span><br/>\n<blockquote>Just going by the examples in the book (and aiming for somewhat realistic and elegant book-keeping), I would recommend one of the following for your MC Reaction in that situation (your hard move):<br/><br/>* Give the bully a String on the PC. (To focus the action on the PC's relationship with the bully.)<br/>* Give the PC a Condition. (To focus the action on how this makes the PC look in front of the whole class.)</blockquote>\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/><b>How does "Keep your Cool" works?</b><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">There's a move that makes you "Keep your cool" with cold. Do i make my players use it when they are doing something that their character fears AND when they are in their darkest self (like the ghoul/werewolf) and they want to keep control?</span>\n<blockquote>The basic idea is that it is a versatile move you can call on when a character is trying to do something under tremendous pressure. Can they keep it together enough to pull it off?<br/><br/>A classic example might be trying to sing a song in front of the whole school, while your crush is watching. <br/><br/>It could also be trying to keep the car on the road after the local gang leader blew out one of your tires, though.</blockquote>\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/><b>I'm currently searching through the book.. the PC's take strings on NPC's turning them on etc etc, <br/>since NPC's do not roll dices how do they get strings on PC's?</b>\n<blockquote>1. A move tells you that it happens.<br/><br/>* For example, if you roll a 7-9 when "lashing out" against an NPC, they can choose: "They learn something about your true nature and gain a String on you."<br/><br/>2. You decide to give an NPC a String on a PC because of a failed roll, as your Hard Move.<br/><br/>I think that's pretty much it, off the top of my head.</blockquote>\n<br/><br/><br/><br/><i>I created this post because i had alot of questions.
