                    Spend enough time on the Hero Games boards and buy enough of their products, eventually you run into the questions of "Why can't they do color books?" and/or "Why can't they afford better art?" These topics pop up a lot on the forums there. Ostensibly, the answer from the company is that color just isn't feasible ("We'd have to charge over $100 per book"), and that they can afford the art that they can afford.<br/><br/>See, then I think about, say, <i>Artesia</i> and <i>Burning Empires</i>. Glorious, full-color hardcovers produced by one- or two-man operations that cost $40 (Smylie was selling <i>Artesia</i> for $30 at GenCon; the same GenCon where I bought <i>Champions 25th Anniversary Edition</i> for $100, a B&amp;W book with a plain blue cover that will likely rip away from the binding if I handle it too roughly).<br/><br/>Now, I've heard about the profitability of various indie games, e.g., Vincent Baker talking about how he makes a much better margin than he would if he licensed DitV to Mongoose. Still, I also know that most indie publishers have day jobs, Smylie and Crane included.<br/><br/>So... does the indie profitability/viability I've read about take into account the author's time? I know that Luke worked his ass off getting BE ready for publication. Does that $40 price point make him a profit given the cost of his own time? Or is he writing that off, thereby avoiding the theoretical $100 a mid-tier company like Hero Games, which has employees to pay, would need to charge?<br/><br/>Basically, I'm just confused why hardcover color is within reach of both the big guys like WotC and the indie guys like Smylie and Crane, but not the middle-zone of a company like Hero Games. Or is HG just playing things very conservatively to avoid becoming the next Guardians of Order?                </div>

                            Yep, and a company like Hero has lots of overhead that Mark and Luke don't have. I turn a nice profit on Mortal Coil (which, while softcover, still has nice color interior art), but I'm not trying to pay my mortgage with it. In fact, I roll that right back into production for new games, pretty much.                        </div>

                            The big companies have economies of scale working for them. The cost per copy goes down noticeably when you're doing a bigger print run. Also, if you're going to sell a lot of books, you can afford higher up-front costs.<br/><br/>The indie publishers bring in much more money per copy by cutting out the middlemen. Hero Games are selling through the distribution system. Both the distributor and the retailer have to get their cut of the profits, so Hero sees only a fraction of the money you pay at the store.<br/><br/>That said, I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of indie games aren't showing a profit once you factor in the creator's time. They're doing this as a hobby, so if they're covering up-front costs, it's sufficient.                        </div>

Time I would have been spending posting my wierd-ass ideas on RPG.net in an unrefined and unreflected manner is channeled into making a product that is refined and that I can feel right about selling for 20 bucks or so.<br/><br/>Ya know?                        </div>

1. Good point about Smylie.<br/>2. Leasing? How does that work?<br/>3. What about quality B&amp;W and line art, expense-wise? How much less than color are we talking, and how much variance between good and bad?<br/><br/>Thanks for all of the replies, folks.                        </div>

                            Buzz, a lot of designers (myself included) just buy the rights to pieces they commission for the project, and the artist retains the overall control.  For our scale of work and what we can pay, it seems fair to let the artist re-use their work to me.  I think this is what Guy's referring to.                        </div>

                            Mike, you're confounding a few issues.<br/>
<br/>
The first is career vs. business. Adept Press is a profitable business, meaning it makes back more money than I put in. Assessed as a business, it's grossly successful. I just received word that the last print run of Sex &amp; Sorcery is sold out. No problem - one call to the printer, a quick check on price, the machines hum, and I pay for it easily based on from the income the previous books brought in. Been doing it steadily for five years now - four Sorcerer books, Elfs, and It Was a Mutual Decision. Oh yeah, and Elfs is going through its umpty-eth print run too (I lost count).<br/>
<br/>
None of that has a damn thing to do with making a living, as in paying for rent, food, house, wife, kids, what Zola the Greek calls "the whole catastrophe." The key to a business is whether it's profitable, from lemonade stand to Standard Oil. Whose living it pays for, if any, is a side issue. People bring up the making-a-living thing in order to cloud the core issue that independent RPG publishing is often profitable on every scale, from book to print run to fiscal year, based on actual customer sales, and that traditional RPG publishing is <i>not</i>. Other companies may pay a living wage, before they hit Chapter 11 (<i>again</i>), or because they feed in money steadily from outside sources like one's wife or some inheritance and call it "investment." I'm not impressed.<br/>
<br/>
The second is this whole "time" thing. It's a hard pill to swallow, but one's time is worth <i>nothing</i>. People are taught not to say that in business seminars or self-help groups, because it's a disadvantageous thing to admit when you're negotiating for a paycheck, but it's true. Time is only valuable insofar as the work itself is good.<br/>
<br/>
OK, with those out of the way, I can point to several reasons why a good-looking book can make money.<br/>
<br/>
1. Seek out upcoming, skilled contributors who don't mind working for a little less. Provide contact information for them on your site and in the book. Pay them up-front and without delay (it's less, but it's real; a helluva lot of big paychecks promised to artists never actually become artists' money!). If it goes well, work with them again and recommend them widely. <i>Example: Jeremy McHugh did his first illustrated book work for me, in Sorcerer. He is now a successful commercial artist with his own studio. The core reason is his skill and professionalism - but he specifically emailed me to say that my support as a client played a big role in his early steps to success. That kind of interaction cannot be bought, faked, promised, or finagled. Learn to <u>do</u> it.</i><br/>
<br/>
2. Stay alert to the fan base for those who offer crucial work: layout, covers, and more. I pay for all these things, but not by running after some big-name artist and moistening his asshole in hopes he pities me. Be good to people, pay them up-front, and they'll offer real skills at lower prices. <i>Example: I was pretty surprised to get the layout work for the Sorcerer books - Paul Mason commands astounding fees in his real-life job; he <u>wanted</u> to do the Sorcerer books and told me so, offering his work for less.</i><br/>
<br/>
3. Learn how to research and bid for printers. It's especially crucial for pricey traditional technology (when I began publishing, current POD capabilities simply did not exist). Fight like a dog for the best prices, and choose based not only by price, but by the printer's honesty, which saves far more in the long run.<br/>
<br/>
4. Establish the market prior to printing - make sure people want it and will buy it, based (perhaps) on sales of PDFs and (definitely) on the buzz of actual play. The core is honesty - is the game good? Do people really want it? The advertising-man's dream world, in which sustainable demand can be created by hype, does not exist. You can't make a game successful, but you can make a successful game. Be <i>sure</i> first.<br/>
<br/>
5. (more important for traditional print) Learn how to figure out the breakpoint between number of copies and cost of printing each copy, relative to the amount that can reliably be sold in six months to a year. That last is important. Too many people are seduced into printing many thousands of books, thinking they're getting a deal, and all they end up with is unsaleable stock, which must become mulch. The POD equivalent is, "only print as much as you are certain you can sell pretty soon."<br/>
<br/>
6. Practice mutualism. Again, integrity is the key. <i>Really</i> help others and go the extra mile. Don't cut snake-oil deals like offering to sell books at a discount to people who help you out, or offering "cheap" advertising rates. Pay people who help you. Advertise for games you honestly like for no charge. The payback is diffuse and unpredictable (in terms of how), but it is also real and consistent.<br/>
<br/>
7. Utilize the internet for its real virtues, not its ego-driven ones. The real virtues include its potential as a fanzine, a letters page, an acknowledgment center, and a meeting-ground for people with common interest (i.e. your game). Foster those instead of your Whoo-Hoo Young Hot Designer Cred. Distinguish between those who really help you and those who decide whether you're "good enough" to be allowed to talk to them (fuck those people).<br/>
<br/>
8. Learn to abandon the sunk cost in a project that's gone poorly for any reason. Similarly, learn that <i>no</i> project is sacred. If you don't wanna do it any more, then don't. In line with that, learn to avoid sucking on the tit of internet-club fame based on promising any particular new game in the future.<br/>
<br/>
9. Learn to think one step at a time, in terms of product. Will this work at this time, for this book, in this way? If it does, only then think about the next step (in the sense of "think" rather than "muse pleasantly").<br/>
<br/>
10. Do not publish or design in any fashion aimed to make stores or distributors happy. Their interests are aligned with yours only to a limited extent. Direct sales are your money; store sales (more accurately, distribution-based sales) are minor gravy at best. Learn who your friends are, in that biz, and work only with them.<br/>
<br/>
That's all off the top of my head. I imagine there's more I'll remember later. If all this seems like common sense to you, then bear in mind that I can think of <i>no</i> non-independent RPG publisher who does business according to these numbered points. Therefore it's not about having some secret. It's about not being bloody stupid and not clingint to 1980s-mythology of RPG publishing.<br/>
<br/>
Tim Kleinert cut no shady deals with the artist for The Mountain Witch, to date probably the single best-illustrated RPG in history. He did it all up-front, all by these very points you see above. The Mountain Witch paid off for itself in real sales. The lesson is straightforward.<br/>
<br/>

Everything you posted makes sense, Ron. However, I'm still not sure I understand the predicament of a company like Hero Games. Are you saying that, regardless of having employees to pay, what's keeping them from producing a color book from under $100 is their "clinging to 1980s-mythology of RPG publishing"?<br><br>Interesting aside: Blackwyrm Games gave the same "It'd cost $125 a book" answer when I asked about color print copies of their <i>Algernon Files</i> line of M&amp;M/HERO supplements, and they're basically a 1-2 man operation with day jobs, afaik. (Which is sad, as their PDFs are gorgeous with great color art.)                        </br></br></div>

<br/>
Let's say I produce 100 books for $500 with overhead of $500 for art.<br/>
<br/>
Big game company produces 1000 books for $3000 with $500 for art.<br/>
<br/>
So far looks like Steve Long is ahead. But...<br/>
<br/>
The books are largely the same, so we each charge $20. But the distributor for HG is taking $6 and the store another $10. So they're making $4 a copy sold. SO ther gross revenue is $4000! Net profit $500.<br/>
<br/>
I, on the other hand, am raking in all $20 per copy sold. So my revenue is $2000 and my profit $1000.<br/>
<br/>
Now, why do the indies get away with this? Because we skip distro, and sell many less copies of the games. The distro system makes it possible to sell to a much wider audience...but that only works if there is a much wider audience. We're assuming an audience ten times as large, and the indie model still is more efficient. And more likely to sell out in the long run.<br/>
<br/>
So Luke can actually better afford to take a chance with color, because his margins are so much higher.<br/>
<br/>
Now, all of this happens to ignore that Luke actually sells through distro (and I think Mark does, too). But you see where the efficiencies are to be gained with small press. Luke, I believe, sells to distro only when he's got his other costs already covered with sales at, say, GenCon (which also costs money).<br/>
<br/>
Is there an extent to which the author's time is not factored in. Well, did I factor it in for the authors of the games above? Don't be fooled, many of the people you may think are full time game designers may actually be their entire company, and may actually have day jobs as well (or angels bailing them out). Some few do make it, but for them, yeah, you have to add in that to the calculation. Basically the profits are what they're paying themselves for their time, and the same with indies.<br/>
<br/>
What's more, with indies like me, I'd be writing this stuff anyhow. Can't stop myself. So it's less like "Oh, that time cost me" and more like, "Oh, I spent all that time writing, I'd better make some money from it if I can." The impetus to publish because of this is huge. The time involved is a "sunk cost."<br/>

                            Hello,<br/>
<br/>
Credit where it's due, please or at least where it's <i>also and originally</i> due. I've had Sorcerer books in stores the entire time they've been out, since the core book's release in July 2001. I also laid the groundwork for the stores in the U.S., and a couple in the U.K., to recognize the potential of an "indie shelf" at the store, during my time at the GTS 2001-2004. The concept of perennial sales among books from separate publishers was a new one to the store culture, particularly for books that constantly and unpredictably violated the in-store standards for book size and length. It was also new to them that none of these publishers made any claim toward "saving the industry" or blowing the doors off with hordes of fans, and furthermore, that we didn't particularly <i>need</i> the stores but welcomed their input.<br/>
<br/>
Sorcerer was the flagship for all of this. It's not the only long-selling, long-standing independent RPG. Amber certainly qualified. But I was the guy who pitched the idea of encouraging such games as a <i>concept</i> in stores, and I used every ounce of leverage that Sorcerer's evergreen sales (strong to this day) bought me in their eyes to do so.<br/>
<br/>
The most complete discussion on the matter of combining store sales with direct sales may be found in Chad Underkoffler's thread here:<br/>

If you're willing, would you be willing to paint a rough picture of what a HG (or similar company) would look like following your model?

<b><a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=16245.0" rel="nofollow">why I sell to retailers</a></b>, in which Luke says wonderful, useful things, and so do a bunch of other people.<br/>
<br/>
Mike, your question puts me in a bit of a bind. Steve Long and I are friends. He loves Champions and the Hero System so much, and has devoted so much time to refining and expanding them, and he is so intimately connected to the existing HG fan-base, that I absolutely do not want to disrespect him here, or even hint at doing so, by saying he-should-do-this or he-should-do-that. It seems better for me to <i>try</i> to answer such a question (probably badly) only if he asks me.<br/>
<br/>
Why badly? Because I'm a lousy person to answer that question. From 1994 through 2000, I conducted a pretty intensive look at the business of role-playing publishing. I concluded at that time that to follow the model of success (or a certain mythology about it) as established by SJG, Hero Games, White Wolf, and FASA (representing an ascending order of investment) was no longer viable, if it ever had been.<br/>
<br/>
The following ancecdote isn't supposed to make me look virtuous, but to illustrate my utter limitation of vision based on that (and continuing) observation. A friend who did a lot of work with/for White Wolf asked me (in some frustration) what I'd do if I were head guy at that company. I looked at him in total puzzlement. I'd sell it to someone else in order to get back to publishing my own games as Adept Press, of course. I'd use the bucks to knock off some of my accumulated middle-class-American debt.<br/>
<br/>
Given that semi-clueless world-view, I can't even imagine what a similar company would or should do, because I don't get the wavelength. Is the goal to make money, and if so, at what minimum print run? To pump out more books and occupy more shelf-space than the next guy? To focus on the very perfect thing that the established fan-base wants next? To impress the investors? To expand distribution? Or? Maybe it's not only my limitation of vision, though. My impression is that many of the main people in the sort of companies you're asking about don't really know the answers for themselves.<br/>

Pfft. No sweat. Thanks very much for your responses, and I totally understand what you're say w/r/t Mr. Long. I chat with him at GenCon whenever I get the chance. I, too, am not trying to criticize his and Darren's decisions. I just want to better understand their position, and how it relates to that of indie folk like you and Luke.

                            Like Luke, we see about 1/3 of our Panty Explosion sales through distribution. The rest are direct. As we all know direct sales, and the larger amount of money they bring per unit, are preferable. But, and I'm sure this is pretty universal, I've had people tell me they never heard of Panty explosion till they bought it at their local retailer. or they never would have bought it except they had a chance to thumb through it at the local store. So thats nice.<br/>
<br/>
Money wise, our sales arn't quite good enough for me to live off. Maybe if I didn't have to split the money with Matt.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the question of why a larger publisher can't operate the way we do... I recently wrote and illustrated a D20 book for a publisher that has since gone out of business. This was a one man book. By that I mean I turned in the project pretty much ready to go to press. I did have an editor overseeing the project. But when I got my hands on the mock up PDF there were 9 other names on the credit page. At least 7 of those people were completely unneeded and contributed nothing to the book. But I know for a fact that everyone of them was paid more then me. Is it any wonder that these companies have to charge $100 for a full color book?<br/>
<br/>
There's a discussion over on RPG.net about freelancers and publishers right now that touches on this a bit (a very little bit). <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=302010" rel="nofollow">Rant and Inquiry</a>.

$25 Million dollars of revenue can hardly be called an industry. Especially if half of it goes to Hasbro, leaving only 13 Million for everybody else. In revenue. Who can say what the net profit margin is? A really good profit margin is like 25%. That would mean something like only $3 Million in profit each year in this industry.<br/>
<br/>
Which is enough to support 100 full time employees at $30,000 salary on average.<br/>

                            I suggest looking at it the other way around: starting with the hobby activity. The hobby activity may not be a famous or money-heavy cultural feature, but it <i>is</i> a fixture. It's apparently renewable from generation to generation, even in the face of technological alternatives. This has been the case since right around 1970. Don't think of D&amp;D inventing role-playing. Think of it as the first attempt to monetize it.<br/>
<br/>
Is that hobby active and spunky? Yes it is. What is its ability to support a <i>real</i> industry, i.e., a set of production and commerce activities which actually remunerate those who invest in it? The answer is, it can support a <b>cottage industry</b> at this time. Small tradesmen who arise right from ranks of practitioners, a high level of mutualism, a tendency toward barter, high contact between user and creator, very minor middlemen who do not own the product, and a lot of informal communication about which products work best for what, and which tradesmen (of any kind) are most reliable. Not a lot of money ... but it fits the criterion of <i>actually</i> paying back those who invest in production and distribution, and also rewarding those who invest as consumers, because the product is reliably what they want in each given case.<br/>
<br/>
That industry exists today. I think it existed for a little while in the late 1970s, too, until perhaps 1985 at the latest (maybe earlier). In the interim, nearly everyone hared off after some stupid myth which I think had its origins in D&amp;D being carried in Waldenbooks, and which people promulgated as "magical thinking," if we <i>say</i> role-playing is the hot new hobby taking the nation by storm, it will be so. This led to what amounted to a distributor-driven circle-jerk for approximately twenty years, in which retailers ordered what the production guys provided, and vice versa, with the distributor's profits being maximized, and the actual customer being cut out. (This is also, in my view, why actual game design froze into a blend or stew of Champions/Hero/GURPS, RuneQuest, or rather BRP, and post-Arneson D&amp;D the games from companies like White Wolf and AEG are <i>still</i> nothing but pastiche of those games, in terms of mechanics and assumptions.)<br/>
<br/>
A few bright lights flickered on. I think Greg Stafford deserves credit for Prince Valiant, which he basically did on his own albeit within The Chaosium. Erick Wujcik is of course a main man, with Amber; and so was Mike Pondsmith with Cyberpunk. A number of others too. Note as well that when any of these folks and anyone else tried to match companies like FASA and White Wolf with the supplement treadmill tactic, they sank like stones (no surprise that FASA went under too, later). It was that fucking myth, you see. A few companies could look big and grandiose with their external capital keeping the ship afloat, and convincing consumers that they were "successful." It is a flat tragedy of economic concept - <i>not</i> true market forces - that people like Mike Nystul, John Nephew, and Mike Pondsmith believed it, such that The Whispering Vault, Over the Edge, and Castle Falkenstein did not thrive on the basis of the games' actual innovations and value, as well they could have.<br/>
<br/>
Because the <i>real</i> hobby activity didn't become apparent until the internet developed into its current form. All of a sudden games people thought were "dead" turned out to be very much alive in play. All of a sudden homebrews that had nothing to do with the crap-wad of pastiche design appeared. The real hobby became <i>visible</i>, although it was hampered by over twenty years of cultural training that "D&amp;D is the flagship," as well as the more recent, brainless, White-Wolf-reinforced notion regarding "roll vs. role."<br/>
<br/>
So Mark - look at the hobby activity. Look at the resurgent actual industry (which is to say, us, here, now). Remove all the cant about "the industry," which <i>never was any such thing</i>, merely a hunk of wannabe promises and repeated cant, with no reliable money <i>ever</i> involved.<br/>

                            Hey Mike,<br><br>Typically, when a book publisher does a profit &amp; loss sheet on a title, the profit margin is what's left after the company has already accounted for salaries. So it's a bit off to say $3 million in profit can support the salaries of 100 full time employees. Because if you use it for salaries then it's not profit at all.

                            I know Paul. So really it's the margin between revenue and costs other than salaries I'm talking about. Since I'm trying to show how many people the "industry" can support full time. Which is few. I'm betting that close to a million of the overall $25 mil is actually made by part time folks - if not more. In which case that means that many less full time employees possible.<br/>

                            Mike and Paul, I'll be blunter than that. Looking across everyone I know in the so-called "industry," I see <i>very</i> few full-time employees. In many cases, that's a euphemism for "has no real job," with the spouse doing most of the heavy lifting in the household.<br/>
<br/>
I can think of less than ten reliably, financially stable freelancers who can count on their checks arriving. In fact, that's a generous estimate.<br/>
<br/>
Important caveat: I'm talking about role-playing publishing. Not companies with diverse products like miniatures, boardgames, CCGs, and similar.<br/>
<br/>
People wonder why I put quotes around "industry." Those aren't scare quotes, although they are contemptuous. Their meaning is literal. It's <i>not</i> an industry and never has been.<br/>

Ron, that's what scare quotes are.  You're not actually indicating quotation of a particular person, but rather indicating that you believe use of the term to be false as well as your contempt.  It's a cheap tactic which disparages the use of the term without actually addressing it.  You should define what you believe constitutes an industry, and then simply say that given this view, you do not feel that the production and sale of RPG products constitutes an industry.  <br><br>The thing is that there isn't actually a whole lot of factual disagreement here.  The estimates of the size of RPG products sales may vary a little bit, but even those who call it an industry don't vary on it that much.  I think it may be reasonable to call RPGs a cottage industry if (as I suspect) the majority of production even in big companies occurs from freelancers working out of their homes rather than employees who are on site.  However, there's no judgement of the size or value by saying that.  <br><br>I feel that this is misdirected, because the important thing to emphasize here is the shoddy treatment of writers.  That's independent of the amount of RPG product sales.  There are plenty of undoubtedly <i>real</i> industries that treat people within the system shoddily.  For example, Greg Costikyan has many similar complaints about the treatment of video game designers, even though that field is undoubtedly a real industry.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Yeah, I mean SJG has 14 employees (and is trying to hire a couple more). But 55% of their sales were Munchkin last year. And I have no idea how much of those work in the warehouse, or how much they get paid there.<br/>
<br/>
WW is owned by Eve Online now...no idea how many employees that entails, but they had twenty-something previously.<br/>
<br/>
WotC has a variety of income, but M:TG was the main source for a long time, and I'd wager still is.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone disagree that Games Workshop is 99% based on minis, and minis rules sales?<br/>
<br/>
Does WizKids even have a RPG line?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
John, worrying about how the "industry" pays it's writers sounds to me like the exact problem Ron is talking about. If you don't believe in the "industry" you won't write for it expecting it to treat you like it was an industry, and you won't be frustrated. That's precisely the problem is that people still seem to believe that there is some industry out there to apply to. That one can publish their work like White Wolf used to do with lots of supplements, and make a full-time job of it in the long-term.<br/>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>John, worrying about how the "industry" pays it's writers sounds to me like the exact problem Ron is talking about. If you don't believe in the "industry" you won't write for it expecting it to treat you like it was an industry, and you won't be frustrated. That's precisely the problem is that people still seem to believe that there is some industry out there to apply to. That one can publish their work like White Wolf used to do with lots of supplements, and make a full-time job of it in the long-term.</blockquote>
Hm.  While the market has been shrinking over the last 3 or 4 years, as far as I know, White Wolf is not substantially smaller than it was in the early nineties -- which is mainly to say that it was never all that big.  I don't think we disagree about the facts here.  There are only a handful of people making a living by the production of RPG products, and most of the others.  No one new to the field should expect to be able to do so.  <br><br>However, I don't feel that this excuses shoddy treatment.  If you ask someone to write for you or produce some art, then you should pay them.  If someone has licensed you their property (like George R.R. Martin's Game of Thrones, say), then you should respond to them regarding the future of the product.  I think people can and should be frustrated if this happens to them, regardless of whether it was done by an industry or individuals in a smaller field.  <br><br>I don't hold individuals in a small cottage field to any different standard then I hold people who are in a larger industry.  You should treat people with respect, and if you take on obligations then you should discharge them.  This isn't an expectation exactly -- I work in a relatively large industry, and I see lack of respect all the time.  However, my standards don't particularly change.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Yeah, we're not arguing, but seeing it from a different perspective. The "abuse" is, I believe, not intentional, but from businesses that have no cash flow, and can't pay their bills. Basically, buying into the myth, they promise things they can't follow up on.<br/>
<br/>
The "indie" publisher might have less sales in the end, but the model is such that any fees are built into the cost for the product in question. I've yet to hear about somebody who hasn't been paid.<br/>
<br/>
Heck, I paid for some art a couple of years back that still hasn't seen the light of day, because I never got around to publishing the product.<br/>

It is sometimes intentional. There is the occasional "HA HA I have your art and I will never pay you now HA HA". That happens.                        </div>

                            I've heard of a few instances of this sort of thing happening. But I can't think of any long-running publisher that behaves this way intentionally. Do you have somebody in mind, particularly?<br/>
<br/>
I mean, it's gotta be easy to imagine that a person is laughing like this, if/when this happens. But I think it's just as likely that they're avoiding you because they're ashamed that they can't pay you. Or worried that you'll sue. Rather than gloating about having cheated somebody.<br/>

                            You know, I do a lot of panels. One thing that always bores the shit out of me on panels is old timers griping about "the way it was" or "the way it wasn't." I've heard endless permutations of the "there is no industry" or "the industry was crushed by card games."<br><br>I always just shrug at these stories. They make nice bitch sessions, but I'm not certain how useful they are.<br><br>RPGs are not some magic product that needs beans or holy water to grow and flourish. There's nothing special or unique about the RPG industry or the gaming market. It has its winners and losers and its ups and downs, and it has its hordes of failed amateurs and crumbling businesses. Just like every other industry.<br><br>Now, admittedly, there's a fantastic DIY aesthetic and community in the RPG industry in particular -- akin to film and music. But the key to it all is just common sense. You don't even need to do market research to have common sense! Set your limits for time and commitment to your idea. Develop a product within those limits. Set a price point for your product which you think is fair and that covers costs. Promote your product while also adhering to your initial limits. If your promotions are good and your product is interesting or sticky or lucky, it will sell and you'll make your money back. If you want to push on to future projects, bank your revenues and invest them into your "company." If you want to cash in, do it. Go to the Bahamas or something.<br><br>As a general rule, the amount of time and energy you put into your project will be commesurate with your return. There's a point of diminshing returns, of course. Just as there's a point of minimum effort to get the project off the ground.<br><br>It's not that hard to be profitable! (Though I do concede that it is hard to make a living.)<br><br>But it's really not any more complicated than that. Set your expectations -- business, hobby, second income -- and price your product and your time accordingly. Work hard, get lucky and you'll see some returns. If not, change things up and try again.<br><br>And of course, it goes without saying, be fair, honest and pay your bills on time.<br><br>But worrying about the vicissitudes of the RPG industry or perfidy of distro or whatever just isn't worth it. Cut your own path!                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

In my experience, big businesses do abuses pretty frequently -- they make big promises and then fail to pay, and screw people over.  There's just usually more forms and verbiage involved, and more money at stake.  <br><br>I don't want to talk about particular companies, because all of my information is second-hand and I don't want to bad-mouth anyone based on rumor.  However, I have heard a number of stories of freelancers not getting paid -- usually writers rather than artists.  And I've heard from a couple of freelancers that the small presses are often more reliable than the mid-sized press.                        </br></br></div>

<p>As is usually the case, I touch my nose and point wordlessly, if enthusiastically, to Luke.</p>
<p>But then I go on to say, I'm a designer. I design for a living. I design books, logos, printed ephemera, websites, and games. This is a profitable business for me. I'm about as wildly successful as you'd expect an independent designer in his 30s to be (which is to say, not in debt beyond my student loans). Game sales make up about 25% of my income, without which I would be in a dire financial situation. If my games were better*, I'd make more. Eventually, I'll make them better.</p>
<p>* "Better" can mean a lot of things. One of them can be "better marketed," another can be "better-illustrated" or "more clearly edited". It's not <em>easy</em> to earn money on the fruits of your own labors, but you also can't get fired for doing the stuff you want to do.</p>
