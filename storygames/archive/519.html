<p>You were suckered in hoping to see me name names, weren't you?  Sorry, nothing so wonderfully insensitive ... at least I don't think so.</p>
<p>"Cool enough" isn't the right description.  Some people won't game well with me.  It's a truism, right?  Different tastes, and all that.</p>
<p>If we ever find the one panacea game where all gamers will happily relate to each other (even the psychotic goth-chicks who bring sharp katanas to the table, and the weepy ponytail boys who spend the whole evening reciting blank verse about their feelings) then it'll be time for me to get out of the hobby.  'cuz ... scary!</p>
<p>So we all know this thing, but ... how do you apply it?  Do you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interview prospective gamers?</li>
<li>Assume everyone's cool, then cock-punch the people who aren't and throw them out of your house?</li>
<li>Game with people on a "first-date" basis (either explicit or unstated) and then either invite them back or not?</li>
<li>Live with the sinking realization that these people are making you miserable and will continue to do so but you don't have any options except the long cold dark?</li>
<li>None of the above?</li>
</ul>

                            I got interviewed by the people I found on FindPlay. and I haver to say it was one of the most stressful things I have done recently( On par with regular job interviews) In the end I really don't know if I was myself in the interview of trying to be somebody they would want to play with. <br/><br/>Don't know if that's any help but it was my view of the process.                        </div>

                            If I know you already, I will want to sit down for coffee (I'll have hot chocolate) and talk about what you want from gaming (or this game) before we commit to anything. So, sort of like a first date, but all tentative. I don't even want to ask you out to dinner unless I really think there are gonna be sparks. <br/><br/>If I don't know you, you either need a reference or you need to be so damn sexy that I just can't say no. But even if you have both, you still have to do the coffee thing, and you still have to pass my "I can hang out with this person regularly" test before you get asked to dinner. <br/><br/>If I've played with you before and we've had problems, you'll get asked to dinner -- but it won't be fun dinner. It'll be more like the conversation you have to have with your ex before she'll let you back into the house. I will admit parts of it were probably my fault too, and that it isn't that either of us are bad people, but just that we've grown apart... but if you want back in the door you've got to convince me we can make it work this time.                        </div>

                            So, I do use an interview process - or, more accurately, I did, back when I actually had room for more people in our games.  These days we've actually got a waiting list!<br/><br/>When we were interviewing, we did a three-step process.<br/><br/>First, we posted on a bunch of New York-area gaming boards saying "Hey, we're starting a game, email us!"  In our post, we asked people to send us an email describing their interest in our game and their favorite character moment from a past game.  We got about 40 responses, of which 30 were clearly not relevant.  Half of them ignored our stated information about the game we were running (highly political, relationship-oriented) and the other half were just totally inappropriate - asking to bring in characters from other systems, using "I have a +2 sword" or the equivalent as their character description, and so on and so forth.  Plus there were the two "WTF, a female GM?" emails, but those were just rude.<br/><br/>Anyhow, we emailed the 10 (or so) people we thought were reasonable fits and interviewed the 5 who got back to us.  This basically involved us going to hang out with them in person, hearing their gaming stories, talking to them about what we wanted to do with the game, etc.  Of these, we actually really liked all of them, so they formed the core of our group.<br/><br/>Step three was actually having the players meet each other.  For our first round of players (of whom we would eventually lose two and add several more) we basically got them all together to create characters and said, "If there's someone here who really rubs you the wrong way, talk to us."  Fortunately everyone seemed to get along fine!  For later additions to the group, the prospective would come to play a session with the group.  Anyone who got to that point was someone that we, the two GMs, thought we could work with - but we wanted to give our players a chance to veto.<br/><br/>After that first session, if no current player objected, you were in!<br/><br/>Socially, I think this has made us a really tight group.  One of our number just got married, with everyone else in attendance and several of us actually participating in the ceremony.  (One of our players is a minister and performed the marriage, which was neat!)  We developed a high level of in-game trust very quickly because we knew we were all on the same page, and that helped us develop our out-of-game friendships, even though none of us knew each other (except for me and my partner) before we got together to game.<br/><br/>Our most interesting story regarding this is the guy who contacted us when we had no space in our game . . . and waited for six months until we had an opening so that we could interview him.  This guy is now my best friend.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

It's just a game, people.<br/>
<br/>
People don't catch VD at the game table... at least, not the games I've been at.  Maybe I'm going to the wrong games.  When a game breaks up, you don't have to figure out who gets the china and arrange which weekends the kids spend in California.<br/>
<br/>
I put games together. Sometimes they work.  Sometimes they don't.<br/>
<br/>
Does it REALLY hurt so bad when a game fails, that you work so hard to make sure they dont?  I know it doesn't hurt ME that much.<br/>
<br/>
I mean... take some risks.                        </div>

                            Why would I want to spend my precious free time gaming with people that I don't like, and who are going to hurt my own pleasure in the game?

<p>It's been a long long time since I have had the luxury of picking and choosing who I game with.</p>
<p>Back in the day, I used to feel people out for recruiting by guest-playing in their own games (the community did a lot of one-shots and Living Greyhawk so this was easy), which had the cool side-effect that I got to play D&amp;D a lot.</p>
<p>These were people I'd already known for some time in a social context, though... I have no idea how it'd work in the case of strangers.</p>

<br/>
Last year I went to a con up at UMD.  I was hoping to meet up with some ENWorlders, people I had known online back when I was doing a lot of D20 stuff, put some faces to names.  Very few of them showed up, and those that did turned out to be duds.  The games I played were (funwise) fairly unsatisfying for various reasons, and the five people who had signed up for the Guildmaster playtest I had scheduled failed to show up at the game table.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't have fun.<br/>
<br/>
Was the afternoon a waste of time?<br/>
<br/>
Well, if I had known what was going to happen, I probably wouldn't have gone, but I don't consider the afternoon worthless.  Instead of having fun, I learned some things about the state of our hobby (at least among UMD students) and a little bit about human nature, and that the game that I wanted to buy (Weapons of the Gods) wasn't actually one I wanted to buy.                        </div>

                            I got interviewed by a guy for his HQ group a few years ago. I went a few times and eventually I dumped them. <br/><br/>Right now I'm playing with two groups, neither of which put me through an interview.<br/><br/><b>Group A:</b> All boyz. I was invited by the regular GM through RPG.net. I've grown to like them as people (rather than dice-rollers). However--another bloke who joined the group after me has been a major source of friction, and the group has all but formally split, with some of us playing one night and some another. Not such a bad thing considering we have about eight people all up.<br/><br/><b>Group B:</b> Mixed boyz/girlz. This was put together by Claire (<b>beingfrank</b>) for the purpose of trying out different short-run games. She put out a call on various internet venues, and the people who answered formed the resulting group. We're just starting to gell, I feel, partly because we haven't been together as long nor played as regularly as the other group.                        </div>

                            I put together my current group of Dogs players on Findplay.  Five people showed up, one of whom dropped out after the first session.  He was the only one I had known beforehand.<br/>
<br/>
Am I lucky, that none of them are hopeless turtles?  That all of them are enthusiastic participants?  Is it the game (DitV) that brings out the best in people?  I have no idea.  All I know is that I didn't need to feel them out, I didn't need to interview them, we just sat down, established a few ground rules, and started playing.                        </div>

                            Fred, <br/><br/>Yea, but a con game is different, IMO, than a game I'm thinking about putting 20 hours of prep work and 100 hours of actual play into. <br/><br/>Or, for that matter, a series of games of 4 hours each that I'm going to be playing with the same group for as long as we live in the same area. <br/><br/>When you're doing something random with someone random for one random night, sure, it doesn't make any sense to spend time equal to that spent with them making sure that they're worth the time. But when you're going to be spending a big chunk of your time and energy with people over the course of a year? Or five years? <br/><br/>Suddenly 30 minutes for coffee seems pretty reasonable to me.                        </div>

                            Something a little more developed...for me, its a cost-benefit analysis.<br/>
<br/>
There's a certain cost, in terms of time and energy, associated with screening players beforehand. Let's call is S.<br/>
<br/>
There's a certain cost that goes into creating actual play. Good, fun, meaningful play has a cost of F. Bad, have-to-waste-my-time-to-deal-with-this-other-person play, has a cost of 10F.<br/>
<br/>
I'm willing to always spend S in order to get F. I'm not willing to skimp on S in order to maybe get F, but maybe get 10F.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have to spend S to get F? Not at all. But I'm not willing to waste my time with 10F if I can avoid it. <br/>
<br/>
Does that make any sense at all?                        </div>

                            I usually go first date, playing something that works well for one-shot and fun.  I prefer stuff along the lines of Inspectres, Falling Leaves, T&amp;T or, if I got a lot of prep ready, to-the-rules D&amp;D (preferably, Iron Heroes, actually)<br/><br/>Basically that generally tells me about the person's play style and how well we're likely to mesh or not.<br/><br/>I basically look for:<br/>1) How much I like the person for who they are<br/>2) Cool contributions  (either in the form of good ideas, creative twists, or good strategy AKA "do you meet either of my Nar/Gam needs?")<br/>3) How the person interacts with the other people playing (Any weird reactions?  Good vibes? What?)<br/>4) How the person interacts with the rules (Can't seem to get the hang of Inspectres? Argues about the rules in favor of realism?  Intelligent criticism/analysis after the game?)<br/><br/>(Right now it's been about a month and some change since I last gamed, so I'm about to go through this process once again...)                        </div>

                            The first date is always the same. Star Wars d6. A good combination of fast, scenario-driven, genre conventions, and acting chops both comedic and dramatic. It's just a taste. It doesn't really disrupt the group, I typically try to set them up on days when the rest of the group is doing other things.<br/>
<br/>
Note that I haven't had one of these in about 4 years, we have a pretty stable group.                        </div>

                            I try, when possible, to meet with prospective players outside a regular session. My idea is to chat with them rather than do a formal interview. My hope is that if there's some fundamental incompatibility that we save some time and heartache. If my game is already in progress, I will bring the rules so we can do chargen during this time also.<br/>
<br/>
Of course sometimes I'm unable to meet before hand, and have a new player show up blind.<br/>
<br/>
I think that I get more solid and committed players in general when we have a chance to meet ahead of time, but I haven't had any disaster cases with people just showing up. Though one player who I did meet with beforehand actually was the most disruptive new player - he basically threw the first session for a loop.<br/>
<br/>
I did have one prospective player interview me. And I would agree with Thor that a formal interview is pretty awkward.<br/>
<br/>
Since I run games in my home, it is nice to have the option, should a prospective player really creep me out, to not have to give them directions to my home before meeting them.<br/>
<br/>
I should note that some e-mail exchange can go a long way towards establishing reasonability. I've shared hotel rooms with folks at cons and such where I had only communicated by e-mail. But I had established some rapport by e-mail, and everything has gone fine.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, I think I take an optimistic outlook to these things. Meeting before hand is really just an opportunity to build a relationship before having everybody there at once. I've only ever played with a handfull of gamers that I wouldn't want to invite. I've done hundreds of e-mail purchases and trades, and have only been stiffed once.<br/>
<br/>
I have had a few people I met with end up not joining the game (including the guy who interviewed me).<br/>

                            I've got two modes, a con approach and a home game approach.<br/>
<br/>
Con games I run with anyone who wants to play, like when I am at a con or when I put word out in the local online communities that I am running something and need some players.<br/>
<br/>
Getting into the games I play with my friends, the weekly games, those are trickier.  That means I have to trust you in a friend's home.  That is a big deal.  Yeah, someone is going to have to make some kind of context to jump into those games but that can be having a beverage at a cafe and talking about gaming or a buddy from work or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
The games with strangers have been going really well in the past few years, though and I have met some great people through it and had some great games too.                        </div>

                            Fred,<br/><br/>The other part of the emotional investment / time investment thing is this:<br/><br/><i><b>I have much more opportunity to game than I have precious time to game.</b></i><br/><br/>It may not be a waste of time, I may have gotten something valuable out of it, but compared to the crazy mad fun that I I could have had in the same window of opportunity will make me make my choices of investing that time carefully.<br/><br/>Plus, on the emotional investment side of things, that would depend on how deeply emotionally invested you like to plug into game and what kind of games that you are playing. If you play out there on the edge, you may not want to play with strangers casually. I've seen games where games failed, not because of lack of action or sync or engagement or fun, but because they exploded bloody and emotionally hard, and with people you haven't selected well, that could mean that yeah, the game could hurt when it fell apart. Even scar.                        </div>

Like Mo, I have more opportunities to game than I have time, so if I'm gaming in person, it's with my group.<br/><br/>However, I just did some shocking math: my main game (supernaturals in ancient Rome) has been running once a week, five hours a week, for two years and one month.  Taking off a few weeks each year for vacation or for logistical reasons, that's still something like 450 hours of play.   Our last central game (Vampire in New York City) ran more like 600.

                            Larry, <br/><br/>I run games of all lengths. I've played, in the last 2 or 3 months, a 2 hour game of Crime and Punishment (which includes setup and reading the rules) that was a complete game in and out and done. I've finished a game that went for 2 years, every other Sunday, for about 6 hours a session. I've done episodic games of Dogs that a group does whenever we're together and feel like a game. I've done a weekly game one-on-one with Mo for something like 5 months solid. I've done games with groups of 8. I haven't done a LARP in a long time, but I keep getting invited and I might do that too someday. <br/><br/>Of course, I don't have kids. I also live in the middle of the city, about 5 minutes from many people whom I can play with, so I also don't have to worry about transit time. <br/><br/>But even then, I don't want to waste my time.                        </div>

                            I do consider bad gaming--or even mediocre gaming--or gaming with people I don't enjoy the company of to be an utter waste of time. I could've spent that time reading or writing or spending time with my family or watching a movie or masturbating. Now, if it's mediocre gaming with people I love--I'll let it slide, but after a while, I'll drop the gaming and stick with the spending time with people I love part. Why would I want to spend my time doing bad or mediocre gaming? I wouldn't spend my time engaging in bad or mediocre sex. I wouldn't eat at a bad or mediocre restaurant more than once. If a movie sucks, I'll stop watching it. If a TV or comics series sucks, I'll drop it.<br/><br/>The way I find people I like to game with is to scope out people I know who play RPGs, hang out and have conversations about things other than RPGs, talk specifically about RPGs, and see if we're interested in the same kind of play. If we're not, I won't ask them to play with me and I'll politely decline if they invite me to play with them. If it seems like we're compatible, I'll suggest playing something with me--maybe I'll talk about a specific game I'm psyched to play, or I'll just offer a general "wanna play something?" to them. Or if they invite me to play something, I'll accept. If it turns out, after a sessions or two or three, that I'm not enjoying the play, I'll drop out (or if I'm running the game, I'll end the game). If we all enjoy playing together, if I'm cool enough to play with them and they're cool enough to play with me, we'll keep playing. It's pretty informal and gut level, really. I don't have any "date games," per se. If I say, "Wanna play Sorcerer with me?" or "Wanna play a game of Universalis?" and they say, "Sure!", we're good. If they say, "Wanna join my long-running D&amp;D game?" or "I run a real character-driven Vampire game. It's really all about the story."--I politely decline.                        </div>

                            I'm working on putting together a new group at the moment. I started by putting out an all-call on the local gaming message board (JIGG). I said who I was, what I'm into, what I want to play, and a bit about my playstyle. I asked that people who are interested contact me by email and tell me the same kind of things about themselves. If I know them already, great, or if they can give me a referral from someone I do know then great.<br/>
<br/>
Those I think will be a good match I'll invite out for drinks and we'll talk and see if we click. Those that do get invited to a one-shot of something we agree we'd like to play during our night out. And if that works, then we'll talk about something more long term.                        </div>

                            I interview people before I play with them, if at all possible. Especially if I'm going to invite them to play in my home. I'm way past the naivete of cultivating meaningful relationships with all my gamer colleagues, but I still screen them. <br/>
<br/>
It's not harsh -- I basically ask them out to coffee or a light meal, though all my gaming buddies (and my wife, a non-gamer, but their hostess)  are welcome to join us. I just ask what they expect to get out of play, what they've played before, and how they'd feel about games that we've played or want to play. And I let them know my house/hospitality rules. <br/>
<br/>
And even so, some people will be accommodating in the interview, and find out that we really do what we say we will, and that doesn't make them happy. They'll leave amicably and voluntarily, and are never heard from again. <br/>
<br/>
And even so, some people will join the group, bring other great (lasting) players in, and then explode in a fiery cataclysm when they inanely attempt to fully enforce copyright on their character simply because I attempt to protect my own game writing before publication. I need their contribution like I need a hole in the head. They get kicked out, and harbor an irrational, unrecoverable resentment. I shrug and move on. <br/>
<br/>
And even so, some people come back to gaming forums and post a long diatribe about how insulting, irrational, and idiotic I and my wife were during the interview. After one of my other gaming buddies notices the very one-sided multi-page thread, and figures out who the poster is frothing about, he gives me the heads up, and I call the person out. I get a half-assed apology that amounts to "I'm sorry I got caught," and the person requests that the mods delete the thread. Fortunately, I'm smart enough to download most of the posts before they're lost forever. I harbor resentment, and make sure that I and anyone I know never crosses paths with the individual (or his wife). They're never heard from again. <br/>
<br/>
Bottom line: I screen people because I want myself and the rest of my players to be happy. I have requirements because I think that gaming is not priority one, and because I've been burned when I don't enforce those requirements. <br/>
I abide by my own requirements, OR I DON"T GAME. <br/>
If I follow my own rules, and I invite you into my home, you follow them too, if you have no sensible reason to reject my rules. Or you leave. Very simple. <br/>
<br/>
None of this applies when I game out of my home. All bets are off, because I'm on someone else's turf, AND I CAN ALWAYS LEAVE. <br/>
<br/>
After family and job necessities, I am in complete control of my gaming enjoyment.                        </div>

                            In my case the ( age group + area + work + family ) equation doesn't leave much people or time. I usually game with people I've gamed with before. This turns out mostly mediocre, with some good bits thrown in once in a while. Most other groups around my parts are "closed", or playing a game I am not very much into, or somehow in the third year of a 4-year-planned "campaign" (ugh) into which I cannot hope to fit. But this is so much better than Tony's Long Cold Dark option (I have a friend whose last couple of years went that way, not pretty). <br/>
<br/>
So I use cons to screen people. At a con I run the system I want, the way I want it, and the age group I want. To my last group I was invited by a player in a con game of mine. The last con game I GMed (the day before yesterday) I think I found someone I'd like to play with as well. The downside is that major cons come around twice a year, and I can only GM/play in 3 games every con, tops. But it's better than nothing. <br/>

                            Is it wrong of me that I use my wife as a canary-in-a-cage for LARPs? Allison just seems generally more accepting of certain kinds of things in games that drive me batty, so I usually wait and see how she likes a game before I get involved. <br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, I know enough gamers that I usually fill my game with friends or friends-of-friends. Online, it's a different matter, and Tony can testify that sometimes you just have to lose a person or two. <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, last week one of the players in my Over the Edge invited someone ... not a friend, really, but someone she had met only recently ... to join the game. I honestly didn't know what to say. Fortunately, he didn't turn up. Mind you, the way she normally games it wouldn't have made a difference.                        </div>

                            Larry: in my experience, a lot of groups have been raised, as it were, to say that they like "telling stories" or, I dunno, "character development," when what they really like is something like "problem-solving" or whatever. So if I say, when interviewing a player for my group, "we are interested in group story creation," they may assume that I'm just giving them the platitudes, and give them to me in return. For some people, this would actually be desirable!<br/>

                            I've been running games for a really long time, and hard experience has taught me I have to screen and audition players for my games.  I had to end one campaign to get rid of a problem player. I was thrown out of a game I'd played for over a  year because I objected to new players bringing their out-of-control toddler.  Really, though, I didn't fit in with the casual, combat oriented play style, and was working up to quitting.  These things (and more) have taught me to be a little more cautious.<br/>
<br/>
I screen people by playing with them at or running them our local club, or at conventions.  If there's a spark (and they're interested), I invite them to "audition" for the campaign by playing 3 sessions with us.  We usually know within that amount of time if the person is going to work out.  Fortunately, I've never had to tell someone they failed their audition.  I expect that would be uncomfortable.<br/>
<br/>
I also "audition" the games I join.  I give them 3-4 sessions to discover if *I* feel I fit in with the group/GM/style/game.  Life is too short to play in games where I don't enjoy myself.<br/>
<br/>
I'd really love to persuade the people I play with to have a frank discussion about their expectations and aspirations - the social contract - but so far I've only been partially successful, and only in the game I run.  I think that we'd all have more fun if we knew where we each come from.                        </div>

                            I'm a gaming slut myself -- I'll play in just about anything at least once.  So I'll try playing with someone in some sort of game.  Generally I try to be a player in their games.  So in the last year, I tried playing in a friend of a friend's D&amp;D game, and I'm trying out some people who invited me to a Gamma World Hero System game.  <br/>
<br/>
Long-term campaigns I'll tend to start only with people whom I know or at least whom I've played with before.  Though, I guess we added Daniel and Elliot to our Harn game without that.  I kind of knew Elliot from online.  <br/>

<p>I basically cock-punch gamers who cross me through in-game means.  I try to have my fun, they try to have their fun.

<p>So far people either realize that they need a <strong>much bigger car</strong>, and they amp up their commitment to their own fun to the point where we can have meaningful conflicts (which is fun for me in and of itself) or else they explain that they <em>really, really like gaming with me</em> but their life has gotten so much busier than they thought it would, and so they really need to cut down on their leisure activities and yadda, yadda, yadda.</p>

<blockquote>Maybe I just have low standards.</blockquote>
Could be. Not that there's anything wrong with that. I know that I have fairly high standards. In college and after, I've played in some really suckass games with some pretty crappy players. I've played with friends who were great people but horrible to play RPGs with. And so, I refuse to play any RPG with any person. Just like I won't have sex with just anyone, I won't go bowling with just anyone, and if I have a dinner party, I won't let anyone walk through my door and join in. I love playing RPGs, but not so much that I'll play any game with any person at any time. If I have to choose between a bad game--or the potential for a bad game--and doing something else I enjoy (reading, writing, having sex), I'll do something else.                        </div>

                            Once, when I was eighteen, I was invited to play racquetball with a friend of my father's, named Mr. Jessup.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Jessup was a little over sixty.  He was in fairly good shape, though, so I went into the game with the expectation that it would be a fairly even competition, because (as far as I knew) he had been playing a while, and I was a novice.  My stamina would make up for his skill.<br/>
<br/>
Boy, was I wrong.<br/>
<br/>
If he hadn't allowed me to get a point on my first serve, I would have lost the game scoreless.  He ran my ass up and down the court, finishing me off with a "kill shot" down in the corner on every go.  It was a slaughter.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn't until afterwards that my father informed me that not only was Mr. Jessup the statewide champion in the 60+ league, he was the statewide champion in the 50+ and 40+ leagues as well.  The only reason he wasn't ranked nationally was that he didn't want to travel that far.<br/>
<br/>
Did Mr. jessup have fun?  You betcha.  He had this tremendous shit-eating grin on his face the whole time.<br/>
<br/>
Did I have fun?  I had never seen mastery like this before.  It was an honor to be on the same court with him.  I gave as good as I could, and a couple of times he commended me on my progress as the game went on - I could certainly tell that I was learning from him as we went.  It was fun of a different variety - I was glad just to be in his presence, but to stay there I had to give it my all, no matter how meager that was.<br/>
<br/>
Thinking back, Tony reminds me a bit of him.<br/>
<br/>
I think what Mr. Jessup taught me, more than anything, is that people don't have to meet some basic standard of skill, in order to be worth my time.                        </div>

                            Right on, Fred. People don't have to be at any particular level of skill to play Story Games with me, either. They do, however, have to want to play in a similar way to me. If you think the GM calls all of the shots or that players are "guests in the GM's world," I ain't playin' with you. If you think that sharing information about your character with other players will put you at a disadvantage--and we've already established that the game isn't meant to be competitive--I ain't playin' with you. If you expect to sit back and have the GM spoon-feed you situations while you just react, I ain't playin' with you. If your idea of "good role-playing" is "speaking in character and spouting dramatic monologues," I ain't playin' with you. If your idea of "a good RPG story" is "follow where the GM leads you," I ain't playin' with you.                        </div>

                            You think so? I think a lot of those are behaviors that are learned from playing certain ways with certain people. I've played with absolute newbies who didn't come to the table with those assumptions and those behaviors. If you've never played an RPG before, why would you assume that the GM is responsible for the story? I think I'd rather play with unskilled players than skilled, if you take "skilled" to mean "experienced in playing RPGs." A lot of time the experienced players (like me) have a lot of bad assumptions and behaviors to unlearn.                        </div>

                            But do you think Mr. Jessup would have continued to play with you if you had started playing baseball? Or had sat down and started whining when he got his first point off you?<br/>

There's a difference between playing with folks who want to try, and playing with folks who aren't interested in trying, or want to play some entirely different game.<br/>

'Xactly. As The Robed Bishop said, not all skills (and not all behaviors) are always on. If you want to play the same way I do, if you're jazzed, ready and rarin' to go, then let's do it. If you're not interested in trying, or if what jazzes me simply does not jazz you, then I'd just as soon not play with you. Doesn't mean what you're doing is BadWrongFun, it just means your cup of tea isn't my mug of coffee. And that's cool. I have no expectation that everyone in the world will want to play with me, nor do I think they'd enjoy it, and I don't want to play with everyone in the world, nor do I think I'd enjoy it.<br/><br/>It's all good.                        </div>

There'd be a trial session for the new player, who would be invited to play this first time assuming that I felt they'd be fit socially with the existing group (including myself).<br/>

Then, I would get feedback from the other players as to how they found the new player.<br/>
We'd tell prospective player that they were on a probation of sorts, but not make a big deal out of it.<br/>
<br/>
If the group decided after playing a session with this prospective player that they should or shouldn't be invited back, I'd act according to group consensus.<br/>
<br/>
I've found that vetting is a bit of necessity.  I've had my fair share of one-session crazies and personality clashes over the years to know that adding new players to your play group can and will change the dynamic.  Sometimes for the better, sometimes not.                        </div>

                            I just wanted to add to kleenestar's comments above, as she's my co-GM.<br/>
<br/>
The interview process has been pretty sucessful for us, but nonetheless we have had to "cock-punch" a few people out of our games.  Which, frankly, sucks.<br/>
<br/>
One of the players was a good player who was horribly over commited.  Having someone in the group demands that they show up to session regularly and remember what happened the last time they were there.  The player recognized the problem and left voluntarily when they could not resolve it.<br/>
<br/>
The other player was not at all a good player.  They were incapable or unwilling to stay in character for any length of time.  They didn't really seem interested in hack and slach either, they were mostly there to hang out and talk about their personal life.  <br/>
<br/>
Letting go of both players, no matter how much we knew that they had to go, was a very hard thing to do, but the positive result on our game left me convince that it is a game master's *duty* to eject players who are detrimental to the game.  Mr. Jessup can take liberties playing with a single partner that he cannot when playing in a group game.  One player's right to fun is not more important than the fun of the rest of the players.<br/>
<br/>
That said, kleenestar and I do try to go out of our way to teach role playing to less experienced players, introduce non-players to the game, and run hack and slash from time to time for those friends who don't like our story heavy style.  But its important to keep different skill levels and different play-styles seperate.<br/>

                            I got an email through Findplay and met at a local coffeeshop.  There was an amusing, confusing bit-- a random person walked up and started a conversation with me prior to the emailer.  So when he showed, it looked like there were two game group representatives... and the random guy was a bit strange.  Once we cleared that up, and the random guy wandered off for a cigarette, we got it straightened out.<br/>
<br/>
It was a bit strange, because I didn't have a game to offer at the time.  We did discuss gaming, and he did join us for some board gaming along the way-- but he moved away before we got another game up and running for him to join.<br/>
<br/>
If it had been someone I'd already known, I just have invited him over for (at least) some board gaming.  Because it was a random internet contact, I felt better meeting away from my house.<br/>

                            Hey Larry<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, I was out of town for Easter. Plus, I'm a little cagey about my requirements these days, which is why I don't jam them in everyone's faces. <br/>
<br/>
But not cagey enough to ignore your question :) Here's a few of my criteria: <br/>
<br/>
1) Personal life first, gaming second. <br/>
There are a bunch of corollaries here, and completely subjective distinctions based on how I've been burned in the past. <br/>
For example, I ask that my players be gainfully employed, at least to the point that they have a steady income and their own transportation to and from my home. I've made exceptions for full-time students, but dedicated students, however well meaning, are unreliable. Their (correct) priority is their education. <br/>
<br/>
2) We're more than just gamers. <br/>
Show respect by showing up on time. Break bread with us ($X buy-in for home cooked meals or pizza/pop purchases). Converse about things beyond just gaming, so we can all actually learn stuff about the real world as well as each other. It's useful for us as human beings as well as to create games that we're all insterested in. <br/>
<br/>
3) Know what we want. Play what we can. <br/>
Role-playing is our primary goal. But real life intrudes. Long-term games are possible, but unlikely. Players may occasionally be unable to attend. We'll play LOTS of one-offs or board games. <br/>
There are many other places to play d20. I already know how to play d20. I want to try new (not necessarily indie) stuff. So unless someone's got a really good pitch or a great track record, d20 games are out.  <br/>
<br/>
I've stepped out of groups I created or helped create because I've lost my job, or they switched to a long-term game when I wanted to focus on shorter-term games, or I could no longer afford the time commitment, or I simply didn't like the game. My withdrawal in all cases is completely my choice with no animosity involved (on my end). <br/>
<br/>
I'll have conversations with people about these rules, and acknowledge that there are points at which they break down. But it won't change my mind, because the rules are there to improve the quality of my gaming experience. It's not about anyone else. <br/>
<br/>
If it was, they'd do the work of forming their own gaming group.                        </div>

                            I've just gone through forming a group, in which droog/Jeff plays.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't interview people, but I did spend some time behind the scenes chatting with people via email about what I and they wanted out of the group.  It didn't feel like starting a regular game because I was pretty explicit in my inital call for interest that I wanted a group that would try different things on a regular basis, that was willing to play in ways they may not have tried before, and so on.  I didn't really get any responses from people who seemed to have missed that message.  I was on the look out for anyone who seemed off, but nobody did.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, only about half the people who expressed interest have become part of the group.  Partly due to scheduling clashes, and possibly due to some of them getting a better idea of what the group would be about and deciding it wasn't for them.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, I got quite a lot of responses from women.  I don't know whether part of that was that I was a woman and that made it more comfortable to contact me.<br/>
<br/>
We did spend the first hour or so we met discussing what we liked in games and what we wanted to try.  Just as an informal chat.  I was willing to kick people out if necessary, but it wasn't at all.<br/>
