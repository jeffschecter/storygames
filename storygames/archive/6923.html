It's based on my Game Chef entry (also called <i>Messiah</i>) but turbo charged with a lot of feedback I got from my peer reviewers.  I won't name names, but you know who are.<br/><br/>Anyway, I've been doing playtesting and what I have works...it's just well... the resolution mechanic concerns me.  It's...I don't know disconnected from the rest of the game.<br/><br/>The general premise is that the Messiah (the true representative of whatever god is in power in the particular game setting) has come to break the world: perform miracles, make a few moral pronouncements, perhaps tear down some old institutions.  The players disciples who should be all for the Messiah's cause, but in fact are secretly leading the old institutions.  It is their job to contain the Messiah, twist the Messiah's words, and use the chaos of the Messiah to better their own position in the world.<br/><br/>So the current mechanic looks like this.  Each player has stats and skills.  Stats are rated D4-D12.  Skills are rated 1-6.  You roll a number of dice equal to your Skill rating of a type equal to your stat.  If you roll higher than a 3, success.<br/><br/>Everything in <i>Messiah</i> is a contested roll, so margin of success is a good thing.  The higher the margin of success, the more you get of what you want.<br/><br/>It works.  It resolves conflicts.  But there is nothing that screams Messiah breaking the world about it.<br/><br/>I wanted to toss the question out to this hallowed body for ideas about interesting things to do with dice rolls.<br/><br/>I have been reading <i>Reign</i> and I need to go back and look at <i>Dogs</i> with fresh eyes.  I just wish there was something I could do to make the game have a more messiah-like feel.  I'd take games, essays, ramblings, rants, RTFMs, anything.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154051/#Comment_154051" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-01T04:59:28+00:00" title="July  1, 2008  4:59AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chris, I don't know what stuff you've tried, so forgive me if I'm covering well-worn ground.  <br/><br/>Have you written an example of ideal play?

The disciples have no power of their own. Their power comes from their proximity to the Messiah. So their dice should come from getting the Messiah to do things. Then they can take those miracles and sermons and twist them to their own ends.

So, the disciples jobs would be to get the Messiah to do some Messiah'ing (heal the sick, say) and then they could pick up those dice and narrate how they twisted it toward their ends (Propaganda: "Look Emperor, he's healing your enemies"). Then they would have dice to use for their goals in the next scene.

You make good points and that is a fine, fine mechanic.  One that by the time Messiah makes it to final print may see the light.   The problem ultimately lies, though, in the fact that Messiah is GMless and so there may not be Messiah to roll dice.  The way it currently works is that there are two end games.  One is to work with the Messiah on his Agenda and gain the most Influence or to follow your own agenda and build up the largest Canon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/commondialog" title="commondialog"><img alt="commondialog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/commondialog">commondialog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155189/#Comment_155189" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-07T07:23:42+00:00" title="July  7, 2008  7:23AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So I got in a pretty long playtest last night and true to form the dice mechanics didn't go over so well.

I left in all the good bits about examining philosophy.<br/><br/>However, to get to the real meat of the question, what I needed was a resolution mechanic that didn't get in the way of the narration. The above mechanic is fast and moves on to the good narrative fiddly bits quickly  So it works.  Could it be better...?

I did have a bit of a chuckle about the whole designing your own game bit, but I knew where you were going.  If you can't make the GC this year, I'll Skype ya.  The game works pretty well over Skype.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155727/#Comment_155727" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-09T17:36:49+00:00" title="July  9, 2008  5:36PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gah, I keep seeing the title of this thread and thinking it's about a game from the masters point of view in 'My life with master'.

Imagine if what tormented you was not that the master was evil, but good!? What terror he holds over you is that you in your heart, you have a blackness - your bent, wrong, streaked with flaws. He terrorises with a perfection that you can only fail to meet come judgement day, or whatever is final judgement. Now that's some pervy narrativism!<br/><br/>Okay, prolly read you wrong and going on a crazy tangent.
