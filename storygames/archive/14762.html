That is a spell can be made up of various elements, like distance, fire and destruction to throw fireballs at someone. Or the same things together to light a fire at a distance. There is a big list of different ranges, elements and so on for it. I can add more details if someone wants.<br/><br/>the next part of the idea is that since it is really hard to make a spell up from pieces like this you need to pass off part of from you spell caster. So he has a fire to stand in for fire. This makes the magic fire easier to do. And throwing something, even a short distance, to represent the spell traveling.<br/><br/>If the spell caster was trying to affect the emotions of a group of people perhaps he could be at a baseball game and wait for the crowd to cheer a home run while holding a token representing the group he wants to affect.<br/><br/>And when I first came up with this idea 3 days ago I had something about Harry Potter style wands as well. But that is about it, no real plans to develop this any further right now.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WPTunes" title="WPTunes"><img alt="WPTunes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/193/nI9P6PIU22T8F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WPTunes">WPTunes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335702/#Comment_335702" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-22T14:27:21+00:00" title="July 22, 2011  2:27PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 22, 2011 2:27PM by WPTunes.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>This comports well with ideas expressed in ritual magic "systems" as expressed in history, fiction and gaming.

I like the idea of expressing all the variables of a spell as elements, instead of numeric values. I'll add something else from the Authentic Thaumaturgy book: the game would be easier to balance if you could leave this as color/roleplaying instructions, and add faith into the equation to define the consequences: For every person that believes in the spellcaster's powers, the effect gets a bonus. For every person who doesn't believe in him, he gets a penalty. The player can then add mana to improve the effect and roll dice to determine if he gets his goal or not. (this way you could even have a situation where the spellcaster puts an impressive fire show but not a hair of his opponent gets burned)<br/><br/>I've tried this a bit, however it only works if magic is the main theme of the game. We had spellcasters whose power become greater if they were able to impress the people around them first, using other tricks that wouldn't be considered magic at all. And on top of that, using different magic systems, we could also use the same mechanic to have the cleric of the town actually working powerful "miracles" for the townspeople. It all ends having people actually roleplaying their characters to be mysterious and deceitful.<br/><br/>Characters can also increase their magic by making/finding amulets, wands, staffs, rings of power, etc. These are actually mundane things that the spellcaster believes to have some occult power or special quality. Perhaps it's in the way it came to their hands. They can copy ancient devil names and use them on their spells, carry around a rock from a mystical waterfall or a ring presumed to be made from a unicorn horn: it's a powerful object if he believes in it's power. Succesfully performiing magic should also affect the faith of the caster, as well. And their beliefs can also became their weaknesses, like a fire wizard whose magic is weak against cold, or a healer against a necromancer.<br/><br/>Summing it up: now you would have spells separated in elements that should be reunited and put in motion by the spellcaster in order to perform a spell (and I agree with WPTunes, bring everything from Authentic Thaumaturgy) The spellcaster's faith (whatever he believes in) should affect the result as well as the amount of people who believes on him or not. (by the way, this isn't my idea, this is from Isaac Bonewits book) The spellcaster also burns mana, which in turn can be a resource that once spent, leaves the spellcaster exhausted.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred" title="Wightbred"><img alt="Wightbred" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/349/nEG30XDP3MO0A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred">Wightbred</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335716/#Comment_335716" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-22T17:43:27+00:00" title="July 22, 2011  5:43PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like a very interesting idea, but I'd push it into tension like Unknown Armies does.<br/><br/>You try and make a group happy by going to a baseball game and streaking across the field with their name on your back.

I'll give the Authentic Thaumaturgy a read through later.<br/><br/>An idea that came to me while reading comments was specialized elements. Like one type of magic might have an element that covers the whole body while another one might just be able to affect blood. That would make choosing to study different schools of magic an important decision. I don't like the idea of only being able to study one school and being stuck with it but having to study one school or branch that gives you certain elements to work with but then being able to branch out and cover other schools of magic later on.<br/><br/><br/>The whole consensual reality thing kind of bugs me. But an interesting idea I had with it in the past was spell casters defined magic around them. Magic is controlled possibility; you make things possible through actions and belief. So a wizard of one school is powerful in their places of power because they have shaped them to be like that by their belief and use of that kind of power. It is making some things more possible and others less possible. Any other school of magic trying to function there would be fighting against that.<br/>A bunch of wizards in a fight from different schools would not just be fighting with spells but also trying to force their own tradition to be the dominate one to make everyone else have a harder time. And that could involve all kinds of theatrics and tricks that are not magic at all. On the surface, because everything is magic in the end.<br/>This is also automatic tension between different groups because if another groups moves into your area it will start to mess with your mojo. I mean, what are you going to do if your fairy ring starts needing orgies to work instead of an offering of beer and cake?<br/>For those that like a world where magic disappeared the spread of different beliefs also diminishes magic as conflicting ideas weaken each other.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wightbred</cite>Or you need to steal the heart of a mummy from the museum to get a mother to fall in love with you.</blockquote>\nThat is just perfect for what I was thinking. People doing things that look totally crazy from the outside but make perfect sense once you know everything that is happening. <br/><br/><br/>I think part of this comes from some of the urban fantasy stories I\u2019ve read.

Looks like it will be a good read.<br/><br/>One possible way to do it mechanics-wise:<br/><br/>Treat spells as 2-layered recipes. This is what I am currently doing with herbology/alchemy in my biweekly game, but I think the same could be done for magic as well (though, honestly, it might be clunky to use in a game with lots and lots of magic).<br/><br/>So the player has a recipe for creating an effect. You have a fire and a dried, pressed daisy, and a sling stone. And using the three of those together with a few magic words and some willpower, you can create a fireball spell. If you have all of them handy, the spell is cheap, though it probably takes a turn to get the components out and ready, unless you're holding them out ready to go. More time, of course, if you have to kindle a fire.<br/><br/>But substitutions could be done. That's where the 2-layer thing comes in. The fire represents Energy/Heat, which is one of the components. And the pressed daisy is Spreading/Area/Explosion. And the sling stone is Range/Throwing. Other components could be substituted in for those categories.<br/><br/>So the energy of a flowing river could be tapped instead, if you dip your hand into the river while channeling the spell, though this would probably transform the effect into an iceball explosion. And a kernal of popcorn could be used instead of the pressed daisy to represent the explosive spreading (perhaps only one kernal from a whole cob-worth has the right energy potential, so it would take some time to sort through a bag of Redenbacher to find the few good ones). <br/><br/>(Side note. Cobworth would make a pretty sweet last name for a character.)<br/><br/>Each of these substitutions would add to the amount of willpower it would take to power the spell.<br/><br/>And if a component was missing completely, then it could be substituted with pure will, but of course, that would be extremely draining/damaging to the caster.<br/><br/>The components should have a certain amount of rareness to them. Something that makes it so that you can't always instantly McGuyver up a spell out of whatever is at hand, at least not without spending some time under fire preparing things. Otherwise, there's little difference between a well prepared magician and a player who is good a making stuff up quickly on the spot. Improvizing is fine, but there should be solid advantages for being well prepared in advance. <br/><br/>Also, certain magic items could act as reusable components for certain spells, like the way Harry Dresden uses his blasting rod and wand and shield bracelet. So if you had the item, you would just need the willpower part. Mechanics-wise, those items would probably take some sort of perk slot to create and attune (so the character wouldn't collect dozens and skip the recipe magic completely), and could be temporarily removed/destroyed (though they could be replaced during a downtime between adventures, if necessary).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336002/#Comment_336002" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-25T16:15:02+00:00" title="July 25, 2011  4:15PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the way this is going  &gt;:D<br/><br/>-The player would need to define which elements represent each one of the spell variables: range (if nothing is used then it's probably a touch attack or a spell that only affects the user) duration, damage and/or effect.

Hence all players should be spellcasters in a game using this magic system. If the theme of the game is totally different I'd recommend using something more simple like an aspect that represents that the character is a spellcaster that uses certain item/method to perform spells. Otherwise you will have players using too much screen time doing things that the rest of the players will find boring. I've been in that situation with my group of players, in most cases we ended unconsciously cutting that part and going straight for the effects instead of the causes.<br/><br/>Now, if making magic work would be the interesting part of the game, how can it be made so it's more interesting to play? Some time ago I used a rules lite system to make a  game where players were young magicians discovering the world of magic. So it was a game about exploration, PCs didn't know anything about magic at the beggining of the game, and players only knew the rules for task resolution. As the story went on, their characters started to learn the rules of the world of magic, and the players tactical choices increased as they gained access to different abilities and rules were added for those specifical abilities. The other part of the game was about love and the relationships they built with npc's. I had enough with that, and so the players, It's been one of the most succesful games I've ever GM'ed.<br/><br/>The advantage that you have by having players discover the world is that you don't have to explaing everything before play, even the rules for magic. You can roleplay that part and give the players the excitement of exploration. And you can start playing in no time, given that the GM has read the whole book, Though if it's presented like this, the game would have a very narrow focus, since players would be kinda railroaded, at least on the beggining of the game.<br/><br/>Now, there are a lot of other themes around magic. How would you handle it?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tj333" title="tj333"><img alt="tj333" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tj333">tj333</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336115/#Comment_336115" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-26T19:30:40+00:00" title="July 26, 2011  7:30PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am surprised at the attention this little idea of mine has received. I half expected to a comment or two before it died.<br/><br/>Now to do some of the hard work that would help make this into an actual game.<br/>The themes would be very wide open I guess. The maguimagic would in part be the a mcguffin, the props that make the story interesting as you read it. You could use sci-fi trappings or something else to fill in for the magic in many ways. Or perhaps something better will come to mind later.<br/><br/>Waht do the characters do?<br/>They are all wizards who work magic. All of the main characters would be someone that can either do the magic or has a vested interest in it being done.<br/><br/>The players?<br/>Perhaps it it a rotating spotlight game like Polaris or Shock where you take turns playing the main character and minor characters for someone else's main character.<br/>The group as a whole needs to buy into the basic premise of how the magic would work for their game and be interested in watching each other do it. And spells can be done as a group ar the table, everyone brainstorming components. Plus nice friendly rules for helping each other with magic and otherwise.<br/><br/>What is magic?<br/>The source of magic is everyday things and objects. No wands, no lost magic rings, and no powers from the ancient mystical past. The world is as full of wonder and magic as it ever was, you just need to see it. No magic wands, arcane artifacts or separate magical worlds.<br/><br/>As for the magical elements. I would be tempted to do it in three parts. Part one would be some basic principals and examples. Part two a sample list of elements, and part three some guidelines on how to customize it for yourself. The idea to should be to keep it flowing fast and easy, not too much time spent referencing multiple obscure rules. I won't be using much from Authentic Thaumaturgy because of that.<br/><br/>What does a spell look like?<br/>An odd ball collection of things in a strange place, someone concentrating intensely, someone with a very good reason why he was stealing the ___ but he can't come down to the police station just now to explain it just now officier.<br/><br/>The actual effect of the spell? From the subtle \u201cWas that really magic ?\u201d to calling down lightening from the heavens.<br/><br/>Spirits and power that be?<br/>Making deals with local spirits, gods and other powers in exchange for favours or the use of their power? Not too sure. Calling on Zeus or God for power with prayers does not seem to fit to me. Going to talk to Jesus or Buddah, bring some bread to help them feed the birds at the park while you talk things through. It just seems to me that everything needs to be grounded in the mundane in some way.<br/><br/><a href="http://everything2.com/title/Weak+and+desperate+from+decades+of+commuting+the+djinn+would+barter+all+for+coffee+and+a+friendly+ear" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://everything2.com/title/Weak+and+desperate+from+decades+of+commuting+the+djinn+would+barter+all+for+coffee+and+a+friendly+ear</a><br/>That story has a lot to do with dealing with spirits and other supernatural things. Baba Yaga tends a bar instead of roaming the forests but is no less powerful because of that.<br/><br/>Last year I heard the line \u201cThe pine tree outside my house is a woman is woman in a stiff necked dress.\u201d and I thought the next line should be \u201cAnd my mother invites her in for tea on the weekend.\u201d. I like that.<br/><br/>So spirits, but perhaps not in the way you would think.<br/><br/><br/>I'll make another run at it tomorrow if I have a chance but this might have to last us until the wekeend for my ideas. Feel free to run wild peoples.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_336116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tj333" title="tj333"><img alt="tj333" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tj333">tj333</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336116/#Comment_336116" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-26T19:33:33+00:00" title="July 26, 2011  7:33PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure I'm putting magic back into magic but I like posts 10 and 11.<br/><br/>A bit of an open question, how do you handle most of the players learning the rules of in game fiction as the game is played?

I'd get them to create their characters through a tough situation and use that to determine an appropriate tradition for each persons magic abilities.

Someting I have strufgled with a bit myself in other game ideas.</blockquote>\nIt all depends on how different is the resolution system for magic vs non-magic actions. If you manage to make it the same, or something that derivates from either one of them, then it's simple to add variations of the same mechanic.<br/><br/>In the game about magic I used to run, mechanic was just "roll a d10 against difficulty or opposed roll" no stats, no abilities, no bonuses. Then, as PCs became better at something or got some equipment  it was "now add a +1, since now you are faster because of X"<br/><br/>Then there was the magic. The first thing PCs learned, half into the first session was elemental magic. They rolled a d4 to see which element they could channel:earth, water (and ice) wind or fire. And then... they would roll a d10 against difficulty or opposed roll. However, out of combat effects (and for some tactical choices) the number rolled in d10 meant "cubic meters of such element disposed however you want, up to the same number of meters in distance, provide you've got line of sight"<br/><br/>This simple magic mechanic made incredible combats possible and had players going crazy with tactical choices. The fact that the power of the magic was so random only gave the excitement of uncertainty to the game and since the PCs were only starting to dabble into magicks, it made sense they were only this good. Of course, the first opponents were jellys and rats. But jellys who had a background and a culture, and whose only magician turned the PCs into jellys for a while, to be able to talk it out. Oh, and rats which had a Lich rat for leader XD<br/><br/>After a couple of sessions we roleplayed a training scene, and according to their choices the characters got different additional abilities. Players could also play these escenes solo and when the group reunited again it was cool to see them show off their new abilities to the group. And these training scenes were only interrupted to explain an additional rule about the new ability gained, like "now you don't need to roll the d4 to see which element your character can use now, you just choose one" and "now your d10 is multiplied by 2 when you do magick"<br/><br/>Of course, the fun depended on giving the players more options instead of using magic, though making magic made some stuff a lot more easier. I also used a constrain given by the setting, where PCs "couldn't do magic in front of normal people, or The Council of Mages would come after them"<br/><br/>Dropping the rules by bits helps to keep the magic mysterious. You don't have to explain how NPCs did this or that, since "magicians don't go telling their tricks... for nothing" And so players have to come up with a solution of their own or barter for spells with other NPCs<br/><br/>To balance the elemental magic being so random I added spells that had other effects with fixed numbers, but that needed mana to be cast. These spells could only be learned in game by convincing NPCs or other players of teaching them (and later in the game, by doing research) and The mana pool of the characters though limited, could be increased in training scenes or by buying mana stones (sort of batteries they had to recharge daily)<br/><br/>I'd say in a game like this you can give starting players only basic knowledge about one spell and have them barter among themselves or with NPCs to learn about the uses and whereabouts of other objects, spirits, places, etc. and ways to use them. Or you can give them none at all and let them find out how to do magic in the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336166/#Comment_336166" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-27T10:17:43+00:00" title="July 27, 2011 10:17AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was thinking - Players would need to create characters with clear motivations and objectives that could drive them deeper into magick.

You have some guidelines but you make up spells on the fly in your games and then share them with the community of players - part instruction on reproducing an effect, part micro AP.  <br/><br/>-Second, I like the idea of a magic system with a token economy wherein you expend tokens to generate only the basest effects and further tokens to add tags (details) that make up the spell's effect.  Half the fun would be doing things that get you tokens, from harvesting to stealing, and half on spending them.  I'm thinking shades of Avatar's "bending" but with expanded and indefinite base elements.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tj333" title="tj333"><img alt="tj333" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tj333">tj333</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336858/#Comment_336858" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-02T13:30:49+00:00" title="August  2, 2011  1:30PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Finally found it.

All he had to do was find a key that would fit the lock and it would open the lock. So this should work fine with little things as well.<br/><br/><br/>I was going back and forth on tokens but I don't think that really fits. Magic is not taken from stuff (as a token you can spend later) but it stuff. Maybe I'm just not seeing how to do it that fits the idea in my head.<br/><br/><br/><br/>For the schools I think i would go with a line of things like your schools is good with ___, is bad with ___, cannot ___, and so on to define it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_336877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336877/#Comment_336877" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-02T15:04:54+00:00" title="August  2, 2011  3:04PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Schools should also provide a theme for the objects used, like chickens and wax dolls for voodoo, animal and human bones for necromancy, rubies or matchsticks for fire magic, and so on. The words, gestures or places should also be related to the school. You can of course use non-canon schools of magic, however the objects should be somehow thematically related, even if it's just for color.<br/><br/>Not that an object should have an obvious relation. Like, a magician could use the lighter of a dead soldier to summon his spirit, instead of using it as a focus for pyromancy. Not that it couldn't have more than one use, don't you think?<br/><br/>Otherkind Dice look ok, the only thing I had for tokens was just using them for some resource management, but perhaps this game would run better without numbers. However you might want to suggest what kind of things can go wrong when using magic to the players, and what are they risking by using it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
