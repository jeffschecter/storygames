Understanding helps sharpen our designs.</blockquote>\nSo, how 'bout them designs?<br/><br/>How does / will / would an understanding of ethics affect your game design? Or how you play? Your usage of a game text/rules? (yes, modding game = design,<br/>also: "play &gt; design") How you design rules? How you write a game text?<br/><br/>Please don't argue for definition or theory.

So, uh, yeah.<br/><br/>But that's not what I'm talking about. <br/><br/>I struck upon this "definition" of mine when I realized that 99% of RPGs provide explicit context for ethical choices, while 99% of other games do not. For me, it's just an idea to have in my back mental pocket when I'm looking at the range of choices available in designs (and how those choices are incentivized).<br/><br/>But I don't design from a theoretical standpoint. I design from a, uh, behavioral standpoint -- or something. How do I get you to do what I want you to do?

Mind you, designer ethics has very little to do with the definition Luke proposed in that other thread, but it's still interesting to talk about.<br/><br/>When you create for an audience, you're communicating with them. When you create a role-playing game, it probably has a fictional ethical system all tied up in the game play. You're communicating to your audience to play a certain way, using a certain fictional ethical system. It might be a vile ethical system and you might have designed it that way on purpose to get a point across. Look at Vincent Baker's games for different shades of this design ethos: kill puppies for satan and Poison'd, especially. So designing a vile fictional ethical system doesn't alone make you a vile person. You're responsible for what you communicate, which is a thing deeper than the material.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228120">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mike_the_pirate" title="mike_the_pirate"><img alt="mike_the_pirate" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y4/r_goulet/smalliconmike.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mike_the_pirate">mike_the_pirate</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228120/#Comment_228120" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-27T08:31:37+00:00" title="August 27, 2009  8:31AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How do you keep from hammering your players over the head with ethics, or whatever you consider to be the "right" ethical decisions when designing?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228125/#Comment_228125" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-27T08:59:13+00:00" title="August 27, 2009  8:59AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Make it fun.<br/><br/>I mean, really, don't worry about it.

Look at Dogs in the Vineyard or 3:16. Those games have pretty strong messages. People love the games. Some people don't. Oh well.<br/></blockquote> Indeed, look at Dogs. The reason that its strong messages don't grate on players is that never once, in the entire book, does Vincent ask "What do you suppose might be the problem with taking revelation as the basis of moral judgement?" He never says anywhere that it's possible to be too enthusiastic, in the original sense of the word. He never points out that teenagers are very poor at judging risk and harm, especially over the long term. He just says that we should tell stories about teenagers enthusiastically making judgements about risk and harm, based on the truth as it's revealed to them both via the traditions of the Faith, and as the King of Life talks to them each day. He mentions it might lead to trouble.<br/><br/>Yet again, the example of Saint Vincent shines forth yea with a light like unto a beacon. Go and do likewise. Arrange for your theme to come up in play via the rules. Let the players make it their own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228150/#Comment_228150" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-27T10:14:27+00:00" title="August 27, 2009 10:14AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: mike_the_pirate</cite>How do you keep from hammering your players over the head with ethics, or whatever you consider to be the "right" ethical decisions when designing?</blockquote>\nBut in games like the ones I think you're referring to (Burning Wheel, Dogs in the Vineyard), the idea isn't that there is a "right" set of ethical decisions the designer or GM wants the players (or characters) to make. The idea is that you want their ethical decisions - whatever they turn out to be - to be front and center in the fiction of the game.

There isn't a shred of remotely moral or ethical behavior on the part of the PCs - they are murderous bastards. Which is played for laughs. Dealing with the fact of their murderous bastardness isn't the point of the game. It isn't even addressed by the players. (Which, to check back to the innumerable "ethics" threads, is not the same as saying there *are* no ethical choices).<br/><br/>It's a fairly common way to play RPGs, I think. There's nothing wrong with it, although I think the more games you play that *aren't* like that, the less satisfying it gets. Or maybe that's just me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228244/#Comment_228244" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-27T15:05:35+00:00" title="August 27, 2009  3:05PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: mike_the_pirate</cite>How do you keep from hammering your players over the head with ethics, or whatever you consider to be the "right" ethical decisions when designing?</blockquote>\nShun, eschew, omit, run from ethics mechanics.<br/><br/>Instead, present and interesting or compelling situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

In Dogs, the GM presents a town, and the players (as their characters) have to figure out a solution as best they can. But teh question arises from the GM, right? In BW, the player writes his Beliefs and says "this is what I want my character's ethical questions to be about." Then the GM is supposed to challenge those Beliefs.<br/><br/>But those questions are all generated by players. You can put and ethical question in your game, too. Take Luke's post-apocalyptic setting Under a Serpent Sun. The only people who have the power to save umanity from extinction get that power by victimizing other humans. No matter what your Beliefs are, the question of how you deal with that is unavoidable. It's not the same as hammering players with "X is right! Y is wrong!" like, say, Humanity in Vampire.

The GM shouldn't think "That's the wrong thing to do, so I'm going to punish him with this..." He should think "The man and the woman loved each other, and will be reasonably upset. It would be likely for them to do this..."<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously there's going to be some ethical judgment in the interpretation of consequences. It's basically impossible not to. But the trick is to do your best to not judge as omniscient observer, but instead to judge as individual characters affected by the decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you slaughter an orcish village while the hunters are away, then it makes sense that the orcish hunters will attack a human village. It's not karma, or divine balance. It's causality. The players may decide that the orcish attack on the human village isn't indirectly their fault, and instead is simply vindication that orcs are monsters who need to be wiped out. That is an ethical decision.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn't anything done with mechanics. As a designer, the only way I see that you can encourage this is to talk about it in the rules text, possibly during scenario design advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nMechanically, the important thing is to make sure decisions have teeth, that the players have a way to make their decisions matter within the fiction. Most games do this by default. Slaughtering a village can be handled by the combat mechanics of pretty much any traditional game. Dogs in the Vineyard allows this a different way, by saying "Say Yes or Roll the Dice." The Dogs say "you are now divorced. You will be married to this man before we leave." And the people of the Branch either do as they're told, or they defy the Dogs, and probably bring it to dice. If the Dogs win the dice game, then they still get what they want. What happens afterward...

Like, sure, escalating isn't a reward. But it's sure as hell rewarding, looking at the mechanics. You're rewarded for it. The fact that it's not, technically, a reward mechanic is of less interest. At least when I'm in a conflict in Dogs, I'm not thinking "How can I get the best fallout from this?", I'm thinking "How can I get this fucker to admit he's a sinner?" I'm trying to win the conflict, and escalating brings me closer to that goal. I mean, who the hell plays Dogs and chases fallout?<br><br>The fallout thing makes taking the blow a more alluring option and balances it with the other choices (escalating and giving in). But that's not what you're chasing in the conflict.<br/><br/>So that's how Dogs makes you take ethical stands. It says "You can win this, but you're going to have to [i]shoot him in his motherfucking face[/i] to do it." Which makes it a hard choice.<br/><br/>Also, Marshall: Because nobody plays it that way. And with good reason. First of all, going into a conflict guns blazing is rare. Second, if you do that more often, the game won't work. It's clearly stated that the three choices of escalating, taking the blow and giving in should be about equally hard. Face it, "You can win this, but you're going to have to <i>talk to his motherfucking face</i> to do it." isn't as punchy.<br/><br/>(Edited for bad formatting)                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228421/#Comment_228421" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-28T11:23:23+00:00" title="August 28, 2009 11:23AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon_Pettersson</cite>Also, Marshall: Because nobody plays it that way.

I helped, so m'bad there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find that I don't necessarily have much more to say. To summarize my view, the best way to handle ethics is to not be explicit. Yes, you can have mechanics that directly deal with ethical decisions, but it's more powerful, I believe, if the ethical decisions arise from the fiction. Nathan's last line a couple posts up nails it. <i>The fiction matters.</i> The mechanics should support the fiction, but shouldn't incline you to judge one way or t'other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228491/#Comment_228491" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-28T14:25:25+00:00" title="August 28, 2009  2:25PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, why don't we assume, for the purposes of this thread, that everybody would do something appropriate for the fiction, when they raise, escalate, or say "I love you."<br>'Cause <i>we</i> would, right?<br><br>One thing that kinda makes me wonder, and chime in if you can enlighten me. Nathan's example of unconstrained choice was within a conflict, it was about the fiction attached to a raise or see (dodge bullet/deflect bullet with coat). But Lance gave an example of choice at the what's at stake level, where he divorced the couple, and made the woman marry another man. What's the difference, in terms of the way they feel, how those two "levels" affect your choices, and how they play out ethically? Do you feel there's more choice in one version? Or am I just seeing something there that isn't?                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228494/#Comment_228494" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-28T14:40:57+00:00" title="August 28, 2009  2:40PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Johnstone</cite>How does / will / would an understanding of ethics affect your game design? </blockquote>\nIn building a random events table that I was gonna build anyway, I made a mental note that "Hey, the mini-situations that are generated here should be <i>obviously</i> ones where characters can make value decisions!

The game is about the Spectre of violence in human history, and the price in suffering that's paid for 'progress." A heady topic, indeed, and certainly a loaded one. I tried to step out of the way of pre-answering the central questions ("Is making a better world worth all the violence and oppression? Will it even BE a better world?") by providing tools with various incentives and drawbacks and leaving the players to their own devices.<br><br/>You do get a bonus for using violent means to achieve your ambitions--but those extra dice you roll have both positive and negative results. They increase your chance of winning the conflict, but certain die results produce brutal unintended consequences, and increases the overall level of suffering in the world. Too much suffering ("Beast Points") and they'll overwhelm the Hope points you're desperately accumulating and wreck your utopia. I've tried to weight the procedures so there's no statistically obvious path to victory, but there are clear advantages and drawbacks to different approaches, and they ring true in their fictional context. Like Lance points out, it's about causality.<br/><br/>Players all choose how to interact with that system. I've seen some (there's one in every game) who choose All Violence, All the Time, just to see what'll happen. They generally--not always--win their Ambition, but leave a trail of corpses in their wake. A lot of players go kinda middle of the road, and pick violence or not based on circumstance. I've seen players start out peaceful and benign, then as they start to trail in Victory Points, get desperate and go over to violent means. I've had one player stick with peaceful means, all the way through, AND achieve his ambition.<br/><br/>So the takeaway seems to be, as has been pointed out, that you've got to build room for meaningful choice into the procedures. usually that means, like Dogs, the rules skirting carefully around the issue you really want to address. If you ARE going to include a mechanic that directly ties into Theme ("Humanity" in Sorcerer, "Trust" in the mountain Witch, "The Sword" in Spectre of the Beast) then you probably want the incentives to be a mixed bag, and make DAMN sure the mechanic doesn't <i>constrain </i>behavior.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228855/#Comment_228855" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T06:11:12+00:00" title="August 31, 2009  6:11AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the anecdotes, guys.

(For example, if you just lost the conflict with a bad card, you can trump that loss with a win by asking me for a truth or dare. If you answer the question or perform the dare to my satisfaction, you win the conflict.) <br/><br/>The idea is that players use slowly escalating truth or dare challenges to learn about their friends during play. That information is feedback into making play (which revolves around character magic powered by acts of sexuality) more intense.<br/><br/>As a designer, I had some rough choices to make. Do I make a game about a touchy subject like sexuality? Is it okay to ask players to bring their real lives into play? How do I make it as safe as possible?<br/><br/>My design incorporates a number of ideas to protect players. For example, there's an "arousal" mechanic that /requires/ a player to pick up a card and /wordlessly/ give it to a player who has said something that arouses them. Why? This is important feedback for people to get when they're putting themselves out there, talking about sexuality. I was afraid that either it wouldn't be given during play, or it would be given with joking laughter, or people would mock stuff. The dare mechanic is entirely voluntary, too. There's nothing saying that you ever have to ask for or accept a challenge. It's just an option you have to win a conflict you already lost. <br/><br/>I could have been more careless with the design, but that would not have been ethical.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
