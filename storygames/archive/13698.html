It went on long after the setting was officially supported, and I occasionally had to look for specific supplements that I wanted, mostly as something to rest our own world-building on.<br/><br/>I expect I was just using Greyhawk because it was the original setting, and I'd had the materials since I was a kid. I'd run several campaigns using those modules, and it built up a lot of history in my mind, sort of like a comic book universe (criss-crossing storylines of heroic characters, parallel worlds, etc.).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310024/#Comment_310024" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-28T07:06:57+00:00" title="January 28, 2011  7:06AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran a very long campaign (two years or so) in high school set in Forgotten Realms, but with 3E.

We started with 2e, but migrated to 3e and 3.5 when those came out. All told, I have - I believe - 15 years of experience in the Realms.<br/><br/>I've always enjoyed the Realms, but I understand that there is something of a stigma associated with it - something about how everyone just wants to play uber characters and rehash Drizzt. Fortunately, I furiously curtailed that sort of thing in my games, as none of us were really interested in solo play wankery.<br/><br/>The thing I loved about the Realms was that there was just so much to it. Tons of material everywhere. Lots of bits with which to fiddle. None of us were terribly beholden to canon, so we'd screw with the history and setting all the times. It was great fun, I have to say. That's part of the reason that I've set my Burning THAC0 campaign in the Realms.<br/><br/>I've also played: Greyhawk, Spelljammer, Planescape, Ravenloft, Darksun, Dragonlance, and Oriental Adventures<br/><br/>Most of those, though, were only played a few times here and there. Still, I have small opinions about each of them:<br/><br/>Dark Sun is neat and difficult; I have a GM who converted Dark Sun to Burning Wheel, so now I play in a Burning Dark Sun game (as Boulder the cave troll - love it). <br/><br/>Greyhawk was too generic for my liking. Not enough flavor.<br/><br/>Spelljammer was simply bizarre, and I didn't particularly enjoy it.<br/><br/>Planescape is cool business. I love the factions a whole lot. This is another setting that is a ripe candidate for conversion to a story game.<br/><br/>Ravenloft was just <i>lame</i>. I never dug into the setting very much at all.<br/><br/>Dragonlance was <i>even lamer</i> than Ravenloft. The Dragonlance novels were better than the setting, and the novels are fit only for kindling.<br/><br/>Oriental Adventures was cool, but it was quickly supplanted when I discovered L5R.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310032/#Comment_310032" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-28T07:26:54+00:00" title="January 28, 2011  7:26AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mystara and Spelljammer would be the only two that I can say I played within, but I stole elements pretty much from every published setting TSR put out there. I extensively used the maps and setting info for Mystara, such as Karameikos, as the base setting for nearly all of my old D&amp;D games because those were the maps I had available to me. <br/><br/>I ran Ravenloft modules, but they were much more "Your party gets sucked out of the normal setting and into this place for an adventure" with the heroes always returning home after.<br/><br/>Spelljammer I created an extensive campaign for but it never got off the ground (pun not intended). I loved the setting and quirkiness, but for my players it was a bit much. They wanted more Tolkien and less air bubbles in space.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310033/#Comment_310033" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-28T07:29:13+00:00" title="January 28, 2011  7:29AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            -Planscape<br/>-Dark Sun<br/>-Spelljammer<br/>-Ravenloft                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310034/#Comment_310034" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-28T07:29:40+00:00" title="January 28, 2011  7:29AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh man.<br/><br/>I ran (who was always the DM? this guy!) games set in: Forgotten Realms, Ravenloft (yes), Birthright, Dark Sun, and Planescape. We were actually really bad at the epic long-running game - it was always more like, roll up some characters, play for a couple weeks, not be able to to get together for a week or two by which time I had a new idea for something else I wanted to run, so time for new characters!<br/><br/>Notable things: our Birthright games were centered all around the mass combat rules with those crazy cards. We basically went from battle to battle with almost no game in-between, except for making rolls on those seasonal tables. It was cool because it meant I could play one-on-one with my buddy when our other friends couldn't come over. We actually used the Birthright mass combat rules in other settings for the occasional large-scale battles!<br/><br/>I was totally into Planescape, but the players weren't (in the sense of "i haven't read it and i'm just experiencing it through your explanation"), so while I really enjoyed the game we started of it, at some point the players told me they didn't really understand what was going on (which was fair, b/c I was holding all this "critical information" back in order to have a big reveal later).<br/><br/>I ran a lot of Ravenloft modules, actually, and they weren't really connected by any continuity. I still have fond memories of the one that came with an audio CD of the creepy sound effects in various rooms, that was neat. <br/><br/>I remember all of us really liking Dark Sun, and I know we played it, but I dont' have any strong memories of what happened in those games.<br/><br/>Forgotten Realms was kinda our default setting, but only in the vaguest sense of I viewed it as the default setting, so if we didn't specifically play in a different setting, we were in the Realms in my head.<br/><br/>I can go into more details about any of these, of course, but thats the executive summary!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310039/#Comment_310039" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-28T08:02:29+00:00" title="January 28, 2011  8:02AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Most of the time, the 2E campaigns we played were based in our own, original worlds, simply because we wanted our own particular mythologies. Of course, they mixed in healthy doses of elements from the various other campaigns (I ran one which included races from all worlds, even the undead PC options from that Grim Harvest box).<br/><br/>I did end up playing in a year-long Dark Sun campaign, which sucked for the most part. Even starting out at 3rd Level, characters dropped like flies because the GM made it impossibly difficult for us to ever get water. Of course, we kept playing, making new characters as old ones died, because we were entranced with the possibilities of natural psionics, half-dwarves, giants, thri-kreen, and defilers. I think I had over twenty characters in that time span.<br/><br/>We also ran a fairly short Ravenloft/Masque of the Red Death campaign, after watching a bunch of the Jeremy Brett Sherlock Holmes episodes. That was very much a bunch of fun, but in the end, we figured that Call of Cthulhu worked better as a system for those kind of adventures. But it fully cemented by enjoyment of Gothic Horror (hence my hack Castle Blackbird).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick" title="Troy_Costisick"><img alt="Troy_Costisick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thumbs.webs.com/s/viewProfilePic/?siteId=67823825&amp;memberId=67823877&amp;size=small&amp;530737"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick">Troy_Costisick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310047/#Comment_310047" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-28T08:48:39+00:00" title="January 28, 2011  8:48AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Teataine</cite>I ran a very long campaign (two years or so) in high school set in Forgotten Realms, but with 3E.

I was apprenticed to Tenser, but he never seemed to do anything useful.<br/>Spelljammer (4th ed).  All the cool bits of 2nd ed Spelljammer kept around, embarassing bits dropped by the wayside.  Still allows for some epic and surreal moments, though, like the insane beholder or the aboleth fight on a space whale carcass.  Started as a World's Largest Dungeon game, but has been a Spelljammer game for a year or two now.<br/>Al-Qadim/Planescape mashup (4th ed).  When two friends were bored, I offered to run a game at the drop of a hat.  That game wound up being set in the City of Brass, where efreeti enslave humans and other mortals.  The PCs were part of the Resistance/underground railroad.  They were also level 1, and so killing efreets was right out.

When I game, I want the story to be something interesting and new.  So weird settings like Dark Sun, Planescape or Spelljammer appeal to me.  They're strange, different from the default D&amp;D.  Any weird thing you can think of can fit in somewhere, and stuff that wouldn't fit a normal setting work just fine.  Greyhawk or Forgotten Realms, in contrast, are way too bland.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310067/#Comment_310067" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-28T10:37:53+00:00" title="January 28, 2011 10:37AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Troy_Costisick</cite>Al-Qadim</blockquote>\nI ran gigantamundo Al-Qadim campaigns, primarily about preparing bombastic speeches and self-aggrandizing (or -deprecating) lies.  "Grace and prayer-blessing be upon the great Sultan, and upon his family and companion train, verily the works and words of those gone before us have become instances and examples to men of our modern day, that folk may view what admonishing chances befell other folk and may therefrom take warning; and that they may peruse the annals of antique peoples and all that hath betided them, and be thereby ruled and restrained..." blah blah blah blah.  We were all roguish con artists and liars and were constantly being chased out of this place or that place and getting all our gold and magic stolen by hot chicks in vests with no shirt.<br/><br/>Al-Qadim is really quite great.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Troy_Costisick</cite>Birthright</blockquote>\nI was never able to put a campaign of this one together, though I liked the concepts.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Troy_Costisick</cite>Dark Sun</blockquote>\nSeemed like a waste of time.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Troy_Costisick</cite>Dragonlance</blockquote>\nPlayed several of the modules out of order.

Who doesn't want to be a giant minotaur dude with a hammer? Nobody, nobody doesn't want to be that.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Troy_Costisick</cite>-Forgotten Realms<br/>-Forgotten Realms: Arcane Age</blockquote>\nI loooove the Forgotten Realms. Virtually all my D&amp;D play was in the Forgotten Realms. What I liked about it was how big it was and how many horrible supervillains were around trying to blow it up.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Troy_Costisick</cite>Greyhawk</blockquote>\nMeh, Temple of Elemental Evil? I guess. I never really saw a significant difference between Realms and Greyhawk. I guess the art in one of them had more mud in it or something. Fuck  gaming art. I just put shit from Greyhawk into the Realms game and it was fine.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Troy_Costisick</cite>Hollow World</blockquote>\nOnly picked this one up long after the game had faded. I'm saving it for a pulp 1930s game where the characters end up there with fedoras and pistols.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Troy_Costisick</cite>Planscape</blockquote>\nDid a couple of things with a D20 version of this. (The Planescape reunion book, Beyond Countless Doorways, was also dynamite.)  Didn't really do a campaign with it for reasons not having to do with the material.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Troy_Costisick</cite>Spelljammer</blockquote>\nAgain, I have it, I haven't done anything with it yet though I definitely want to at some point. Dragonmech and Dragonstar both have some good things going on there that could make Spelljamming fun.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Troy_Costisick</cite>Ravenloft</blockquote>\nI did some brief stuff in AD&amp;D because it seemed to be how they anticipated it would be used?  "And then the Mists lift and you're back at home and your elf girlfriend comes in yelling about how you missed her birthday."  The Third Edition stuff I thought was much better, since you were supposed to be playing people who were more deeply and directly tied into the horrific setting.

Had a lot of fun, but didn't play by the rules: Only one PC for each player, I was more into creating cool mad max-y stories than throwing a body count. I still remember that one of the players played a Water Priest, obsessed with blood ("people water").\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Troy_Costisick</cite>-Dragonlance</blockquote>\nPlayed it for about 2 sessions of a game that was basically Forgotten Realms with Kender.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Troy_Costisick</cite>-Forgotten Realms</blockquote>\nLots.

Never actually played it as a character.<br/><br/>The campaign I ran involved a mostly diceless game about adventurers from other planes with amnesia that wake up on the banks of a river near the plane of the Egyptian Gods. They got Thoth's help with recovering their memories. They were basically hidden there by a long-dead god so as not to be used as pawns in some great cosmic plot blah blah blah comic-book bullshit. But it was fun, there was a lot of role-playing, and only a few minutes in Sigil.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Troy_Costisick</cite>-The Ravenloft</blockquote>\nSome. One as JD described "Mist come and take you to backstab some werewolves, then appear again and you're back home", but another longer side-campaign where we were all native Barovians going against one of the death lords.

A lot of these I would run or play at the drop of the hat using FATE or Burning Wheel.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Birthright<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was one of those great ideas that so did not fit D&amp;D, the world was very D&amp;D it had cool monsters, tons of places to go adventure, lots of meaty kingdoms to really root for... but the game was really focused on being the leaders in charge of the kingdoms and rules for that kinda sucked. Looking back if we had skipped the king part and played adventures our campaign would have rocked. A few years back I ran Burning Wheel game of Birthright that was pretty rad though.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Dark Sun<br/>\n<br/>\nI love me some Dark Sun, I ran several campaigns of this throughout high school back in the day, this setting is responsible for my love of a good desert setting and I wonder how much my love of Dune is due to Dark Sun. We played games ranging from magic users on the run from the Sorcerer King, to escaped slaves living in tribes in the wastes, to a very traditional adventures roaming the tablelands looting ruins, fighting monsters and doing odd jobs for merchant houses. I remember the first published adventure "Freedom" was pretty cool too and I ran that twice as a launching point for 2 campaigns. Looking at the 4E book makes me want to run a Burning Wheel or FATE version of Dark Sun.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Dragonlance<br/>\n<br/>\nWe played and ran in this setting a lot when I was a teen since me and my friends all loved the novels back then, but it was never as awesome as the worlds we made ourselves or the other settings out there. <br/>\n<br/>\n- Planscape<br/>\n<br/>\nThis may be one of my favorite settings out there, something about the infinitely weird and bizarre planes of existence filled with every heaven and hell, the factions of philosophers with swords, the amazing art, the way belief shapes the cosmos, the awesome maps and diagrams of the planes, setting games in the city of doors where the whole multiverse is just a portal away... so much awesome. I ran some of my longest running D&amp;D campaigns in this setting and we still didn't do all the cools things in this setting. Plus the Factol's Manifesto is one of the best game books out there. <br/>\n<br/>\n- Spelljammer<br/>\n<br/>\nRan a nice and bloody campaign about Drow pirates raiding the space ways when this first came out and then a few years back ran an updated version of the setting using Savage Worlds that drew heavily on Babylon 5, Firefly and Eberron as source material that I would like to explore again using FATE one of these days. <br/>\n<br/>\n- Ravenloft<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was one of my friends favorite games so we played it a lot, the game never was the gothic horror it promised however and was more a D&amp;D game in which chances are you die sooner than latter and there are a lot of undead, still fun but not what was advertised. I still remember going through haunted houses like dungeons... though some of the published adventures were better at the horror than others and the rest tried to in the background or story but then still provided you with a dungeon map to explore and loot.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Colin                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike" title="Steerpike"><img alt="Steerpike" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/73053145/4961238"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike">Steerpike</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310087/#Comment_310087" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-28T12:52:21+00:00" title="January 28, 2011 12:52PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 28, 2011 12:53PM by Steerpike.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was just thinking about the Light in the Belfry game a friend of mine ran for us, and yes the audio was sooo campy and cheesy at times but it was still really a neat way of doing a published adventure.

We only knew D&amp;D, and we didn't pay much attention to boundaries or strive for coherence. We mixed 1E rules with 2E rules and Basic rules, used whatever add-ons we liked, made stuff. Much the same with the settings: we mixed and matched however we liked, without too much regard for purity of sources.<br/><br/>That said, I'm pretty sure most of our D&amp;D play was Forgotten Realms (in the "default D&amp;D world" sense). We'd include elements from other settings, but never too full-on. However, the more I learned about Forgotten Realms, the more cramped it felt to me. It seemed like every bit of it was full of powerful NPCs (and the NPCs, when statted up, were way beyond the power levels I had in my head!) engaged in important, world-shaking plots. It became more and more difficult to figure out how a new bunch of characters could fit into this enormous power drama. After all, if the characters were anywhere near the power level necessary to even interact with people like Elminster, how would you explain that none of these people knew about them? It was just too much to work out: they place felt <i>cramped</i> with powerful characters and existing plotlines.<br/><br/>As for the other settings, Dark Sun somehow completely captured my imagination. This is remarkable, because I've never read any of the books (maybe never even seen any of the books!). But the concept of a dark, alien, desert D&amp;D was very cool. Then again, <i>Dune</i> was one of my favourite books at that age. I think some of my friends told me a little bit about it, and it sounded cool. (Has anyone done Dark Sun Apocalypse World yet?)<br/><br/>Planescape and Spelljammer sounded interesting, but I could never bring myself to play in them. It was just so far removed from reality (or any fiction that I enjoyed), that I couldn't imagine them in play. Too much power and weirdness and magic and crazy lasersharking, for my tastes. That level of gonzo, I couldn't handle, I suppose. That said, I never tried them. I suppose in a properly limited campaign frame (i.e. cutting down the elements in play to a specific, small segment) they might be interesting!<br/><br/>The others didn't interest me very much.<br/><br/>This thread is making me think about published campaign settings in a different way, however. There is something, perhaps, to be said for the effect produced by all the players reading various bits of the setting before playing. It kind of simulates the "rumours your character may have heard about the world" effect, doesn't it? Like how most of the players in Forgotten Realms have heard about Elminster, but one might just know he's some powerful wizard, while another knows some stories about him, and what he's most likely currently up to (ruling Waterdeep, or whatever).<br/><br/>Home-brew campaigns rarely had that whole thing where you look at the bigger picture. Like how some people above are mentioning that their characters were hoping to eventually become powerful enough to face [some entity in the setting]. It's harder to do that when you're learning about the whole world together, for scratch.<br/><br/>Hmm!

My group really loved the Gord the Rogue novels you see and they gave me a really good flavor of the world without proscribing too much.  Plus the Gazetteer and that giant hex map just excited me to go and explore.  Pretty much any campaign I run is set here.  I made a version of Greyhawk that I consider mine and that never really happened with the other game worlds.<br/><br/><b>Forgotten Realms:</b>  The Realms is my favorite world that I never play in.  On some level it always felt like Ed Greenwood's and R.A. Salvatore's world and not mine.  I loved reading the novels and the Realm's supplements but I always mined them for ideas and items to import into my Greyhawk campaigns.  I can play in the Realms fine but GMing in just never gelled for me.<br/><br/><b>Dark Sun</b>  I think my experience with Dark Sun is best summed up by a rant by my friend Steve.  "I was a high level cleric raising the dead and smiting evil and now I'm starving in the desert wielding a basilisk thigh bone with a thorn on it!  I hate this game!"  It just seemed to be punishment for punishment's sake really.  None of us really knew what to do with it and the high fantasy to gritty fantasy transition was too abrupt.  <br/><br/><b>Spelljammer</b>  Loved it.  Absolutely loved it.  I've run it as both a dedicated space campaign and as a palette cleanser between dungeon delves.  I don't know why swashbuckling in space works better than swashbuckling on the ocean but it did.  I think it was the freedom to just make up anything.  Its like Star Trek.  Every planet can be a complete change of pace and theme.  Plus, when it became implausible for yet another 20th level necromancer to appear on their home planet I could bring one in from space.<br/><br/><b>Ravenloft</b> This was very similar to Spelljammer in that I used it as a palette cleanser in between dungeon delves.  I think if I went back to it now, I could probably craft a campaign within a realm but back then the supplements were one module in this domain, another over here, then the mists send you of to a third.  It was too disjointed to sustain as a campaign.  We loved it for a change of pace though.  I DM'd a very high level high magic party and even they shivered when the mists came down.  They knew I took the gloves off in Ravenloft and they loved it.<br/><br/><b>Planescape</b> This set never worked for me.  I really liked the freewheeling nature of the Outer Planes.  It was like Spelljammer for me where the Outer Planes were a blank slate with a few big personalities and general trends and tropes.  Planescape drastically changed the feel and flavor and I didn't feel it was for the better.  I did love the idea of Sigil though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310377">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310377/#Comment_310377" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-01T07:28:12+00:00" title="February  1, 2011  7:28AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Most of the time the guys I played with gamed in homemade settings.

I still have the book in the "never throw out" section.<br/><br/>I played in a partial campaign of Dark Sun, and loved it. A friend and I were both fire clerics; I don't remember the rest of the group. I still have the Dragon Magazine with all the bizarre weapons in it, and the Monster Compendium supplement.<br/><br/>I ran a 3rd ed. game in the Mystara / Hollow World setting, and had a lot of fun with it. I always liked that setting, both parts. I even worked in the City of Stars. I also did a 4th ed. game set in the Spelljammer setting, though it didn't last.<br/><br/>My favorite setting, however, was Planescape. Still love it. I ran a long campaign of that, have the main boxed set and Planes of Chaos (never picked up the other two), the monster books, and a handful of other supplements. There's just a wonderful feel to that setting.<br/><br/>Right now I'm running a (somewhat suspended, but it'll start up again soon) world-hopping game using Everway as the ruleset. We're visiting most of the old D&amp;D settings, as well as the Diamond Throne, Nyambe, Middle-Earth, and anything else fantasy-like.

We'd first outlined our own setting with kingdoms on the brink of war and everything, but our GM thankfully realized that it was way beyond the scope of starting Burning Wheel characters. When we took our main outline and shrunk it, it fitted perfectly with the Duke vs. Black Eagle.<br/><br/>Apart from checking up on the saints/immortals of Mystara, we didn't use more than the vague description of Karameikos found in Mentzer's Expert rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312390/#Comment_312390" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-13T14:27:31+00:00" title="February 13, 2011  2:27PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dragonlance all the way to the end.

I still have the beard, bow, buckskins and locks to this day. Dragonlance took me out of the dungeon and into a wilder world, a world of relationships, revenge and tradgedy.

The CCG era just decimated their sales, and they overcomitted to everything. Part of the reason I started this thread was that there just so many Campaign Settings back then that it would have been impossible to play in them all for any length of time.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313308/#Comment_313308" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-18T20:59:41+00:00" title="February 18, 2011  8:59PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Birthright - I played one adventure, but it was from Dungeon Magazine (Seeking Bloodsilver), and while I was able to infer a bunch of stuff from the adventure, I never got the full thing. What I enjoyed were the extra powers.<br/>Council of Wyrms - a friend bought this, but we never got it off the ground, the XP requirements for dragons were just insane, so we weren't sure what to do.<br/>Dark Sun - one adventure, in the Revised boxed set, I'm glad they fixed the bug with percentile strength there, otherwise I think I preferred the original one. I made heavy use of Psionics in all the games I played, so DS wasn't that special in that aspect.<br/>Dragonlance - I only actually played DL5A, not the AD&amp;D set, but it was pretty cool, and that was only very recently.<br/>Forgotten Realms - this was the bulk of my gaming, I really enjoyed it, although again coming in with the revised boxed set I think I was missing out a bit, Undermountain was a major staple for us, we usually ended up there at some point. Some Maztica as well, and I've continued fleshing out my 2e FR collection. All the free stuff that was offered on Wizards' website didn't hurt either.<br/>Mystara - only played this for AD&amp;D First Quest, it didn't really stand out to me at the time, although reading up on it later I found it very interesting. I think it's definitely more suited to RC than AD&amp;D.<br/>Savage Coast - thanks to the free download from TSR, this was actually the first full campaign setting I got. I enjoyed the extra powers, races and fencing schools. All around I rather enjoyed the swashbuckling theme, as that was my favourite kit for both thieves and fighters.<br/>Planescape - originally played it like BR, inferring from a Dungeon Magazine adventure, later had it DMed, although I think it was converted to 3e. I had a lot of fun with it, particularly playing a Rogue Modron during The Great Modron March, who was of the opinion that all the other Modrons had gone rogue. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/>Ravenloft - originally only played it with Domains of Dread, which was rather crappy, and it wasn't as enjoyable as it could have been. Having since picked up the revised boxed set, I'd like to get it going again, but that might be a challenge.<br/><br/>The one setting I never got to try out and would have liked to is Al-Qadim, which is unsurprising as Prince of Persia 3D is one of my favourite video games, and Tales of the Caliphate Nights was what stood out for me in the original True20 release.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
