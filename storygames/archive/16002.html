Where are the individualized paradigms subtly affecting what you can and cannot achieve with a complexly open-ended system of Spheres? Where's the paradox backlash and sly nods to reality that can help avoid it? In other words, where's Mage?<br><br>I mean I only have APs to go on but it sounds like Psi*Run is a super fun, awesome game that is primarily about a constantly-escalating chase scene married with a kind of amnesiac-modelled process of radical self-discovery. Those both sound like things that fit into Mage, but they only sound like a very small and possibly constrictive portion of it. There are obviously parts of Mage where the PCs are literally being hounded by the Technocracy, but that's not really the whole game. Nor do a series of simple descriptive revelations (e.g. answers to questions) seem to really do much justice to the sort of self-discovery/magickal thinking that Mage attempts to model.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364719/#Comment_364719" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-02T16:53:13+00:00" title="March  2, 2012  4:53PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If someone knows how you can buy Psi Run, I'd love to hear it, the AP's I've read have been fascinating!<br><br>Anyway, the heart of Mage, IMO, is the idea of Mages being able to impose their own alternative versions of reality ("Paradigms") onto the real world.  The two main obstacles to Mages just rewriting the universe to make it more Mage-friendly are:<br>1) The Technocracy, who can be viewed as Men in Black, the occult Mafia, or just as reality cops.  They come after Mages with both metaphorical and literal guns blazing.  <br>2) The stubborn nature of reality itself, which causes various kinds of Paradox backlashes when you do willworking which are worse when ordinary civilians see the magic, or when it's very obviously magic.  (Fireballs vs. exploding gas tank, for example).  <br/><br/>I think you could develop both the character's paradigm as well as their situation through questions -- if you are looking to do this for a one-shot, the easiest way to adapt the Psi-Run premise as I understand it to M:tA would be to have a backstory that the characters just performed a great working of some kind of magic, and suffered a Quiet (mental effect of Paradox) as a result which has zapped their memories.  The same working also called the characters to the attention of the local Technocrats, who will first investigate and then punish.  <br/><br/>That's pretty much all you need IMO if you're playing with guys who used to play Mage; I know I would have a lot of fun figuring out that my guy was a Virtual Adept, yeah, and he was trying to establish an Internet for dead people with the help of his Etherite and Euthanatos buddies when everything turned day-glo. Or whatever.<br/><br/>tl;dr: <br/><br/>"Your occult meth lab just exploded, and now you're running for the car while slapping at the flames on your torso.  By the way, you hear fire truck and police car sirens in the distance, but they're getting louder."                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel" title="Anarchangel"><img alt="Anarchangel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/333/nG33DU7UK4MTS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel">Anarchangel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364727/#Comment_364727" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-02T17:20:54+00:00" title="March  2, 2012  5:20PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Danny, you can buy Psi*Run on Nightsky Games' website: <a href="http://nightskygames.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://nightskygames.com/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chris_moore" title="chris_moore"><img alt="chris_moore" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://jesus8880.com/chapters/gematria/images/greek%20letters/psi-cap.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chris_moore">chris_moore</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364822/#Comment_364822" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-03T07:12:30+00:00" title="March  3, 2012  7:12AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is exactly the kind of feedback I needed to focus my own thoughts, thanks all!  I realize that I am only interested in that sliver of Mage where a young mage (Orphan?) races to Awaken before being scooped up by the Technocracy.  That's the story that fits Psi*Run, and not everything about Mage.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing that is influencing my thoughts here is the Blavatskian/Golden Dawn concept of the Secret Chiefs: enlightened beings that give astral/psychic teachings to those who seek their wisdom.  That's what I would name this hack: <i>Secret Chiefs</i>, which carries a nice double meaning.<br/>\n<br/>\nYet another inspiration is the first chapter of Clive Barker's <u>The Great and Secret Show</u>.  I want to condense the pursuit of enlightenment/awakening into a Psi*Run session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
