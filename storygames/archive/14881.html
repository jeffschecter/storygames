Want to lend a hand to the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.hammercon.ca" rel="nofollow">coolest game convention north of the US border</a>?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe're putting together prize packages for participants in HammerCon events and would love to be able to give out a copy of your signed game! Here's how it works:<br/>\n<br/>\nYou notify me in this thread (feel free to whisper if you prefer) or by <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="mailto:promotions@hammercon.ca" rel="nofollow">email</a> of which game(s) you'd like to donate. Include your email address. Feel free to specify your preference in how you'd like the game to be used; as a prize for participation in a given event (such as our Cthulhu Cup tournament, Speed Gaming, Great Canadian Board Game Blitz (for board games), or whatever), as a door prize to a random attendee, as a prize for best costume or our coveted Endurance prize (given out for 18 hours of straight gaming), for inclusion in the convention library for play at the convention, or whatever other idea you have.<br/>\n<br/>\nI email you the mailing address for convention support. We'll pay you $5 USD by PayPal to cover your shipping charges if you wish (if you want to send a bigger shipment let me know and we'll work it out).<br/>\n<br/>\nYou grab a decent-looking copy of your game from the box of games you have in your attic, basement, or garage. Sign it! Then mail it to us. We'll send you the shipping reimbursement upon receipt. Feel free to stuff whatever advertisements you like into the game as well and it'll be given out to the recipient.<br/>\n<br/>\nEmail us a black-and-white graphic advertising the game, your company, your dog, or whatever you like. It has be suitable for 2" by 2" print, or for larger donations (MSRP of $60 CAD+), 4" x 5". We'll print that ad in our convention program which all attendees receive.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
