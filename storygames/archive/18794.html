Career: Explorer Starfarer)</i><br/>\u2022\tM4X BECC, Man-made Man <i>(Origin: Artificial. Career: Cybernetic Starfarer)</i><br/>\u2022\tAnder "Suicide" Evans, Stunt-man Celebrity <i>(Origin: Spacer. Career: Explorer Personality)</i><br/>\u2022\tJack Murdoch, Engineering Savant <i>(Origin: Spacer. Career: Industrial Starfarer)</i><br/>\u2022\tJo ("Just 'Jo'"), SectNet Hacktivist <i>(Origin: HighTech. Career: Clandestine Scoundrel)</i><br/><br/>Factions:<br/>\u2022\tMagenta Shipping Concern - Mid-sized, above-board shipping company<br/>\u2022\tUniversal Personnel Agency - Human Resources, Cybernetics, Robotics, Slavery<br/>\u2022\tOdyssey - Mercenary hackers, data-thieves for hire<br/>\u2022\tBetter Tomorrow - Vitamins, Sports Drinks, Human Experimentation<br/>\u2022\tPlanetary Inspection Enterprises - Exploration and planetary surveys<br/><br/>The scenario starts with the players on the cusp of completing a delivery for Magenta Shipping; a straight-forward pick-up and drop-off that has so far gone without a hitch. They\u2019re on a backwater moon which is still going through its terraforming cycles, delivering medical supplies to local colonists.<br/><br/>A couple of colonists arrive in a shuttle to make the pick-up and pay them, when the deal is interrupted by a trio of UPA soldiers. The Universal Personnel Agency funded this planet\u2019s terraforming, and the colonists currently scratching a living off it are there illegally. Transferring those medical supplies violates an embargo put in place by the UPA.<br/><br/>The players really got into the conundrum, giving some excellent reasoning for supporting the colonists or the UPA. M4X rightly pointed out that since the transaction hadn't gone through, the colonists hadn't yet violated the embargo; he wanted to at least let the colonists escape. The colonists, however, were adamant that they get the medical supplies. One thing that came up often was that a couple of the characters were in significant debt to UPA; complying with them would hopefully work off some of that debt. Furthermore, getting in the UPA's way would cause significant problems down the line.<br/><br/>I've never seen such a split party. Jo was adamant about helping the colonists, Murdoch sided with her. Calvin, on the other hand, argued heavily to not piss off the UPA, and M4X supported him (though made sure that the colonists being allowed to leave was part of the new arrangement). It came down to Ander, who went with the UPA because he was heavily in debt with them.<br/><br/>During the exchange, Anders sets up a profitable deal to sell the medical supplies to the UPA, right then and there. One colonist freaks out, and draws a high caliber pistol, aiming to blow Anders' head clean off. Calvin reacts\u2026 and splatters the colonist with a blast from his Heavy Laser shotgun. Jo freaks out and leaves; the UPA official is quite impressed, offering them a job \u201cto basically do that a few dozen more times\u201d. The players Collect Reward, erasing Debt with the UPA or earning their favor (except Anders, who is still to heavily indebted to them for this one sale to make a dent, and Jo, who refuses to Collect Reward).<br/><br/>Jo\u2019s player feels that the party took a turn for the evil that he couldn't reconcile with the way he saw Jo\u2019s personality. Meanwhile, Calvin\u2019s player is of two minds about their choice of reaction; he could have tackled the colonist, or tackled Anders out of the way, or yelled \u201cduck!\u201d. Instead he chose to open fire on a desperate, frustrated person who was seeing their last hope being sold to the people who were oppressing them. I don\u2019t think I've seen characters \u2018solidify\u2019 so quickly.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d" title="Archangel3d"><img alt="Archangel3d" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nHJSFRW82OXJ8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d">Archangel3d</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421355/#Comment_421355" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-11T07:19:36+00:00" title="September 11, 2013  7:19AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2013 7:20AM by Archangel3d.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thoughts on the playtest<br/><br/>- Character creation went fairly smoothly<br/><br/>- While the faction creation had a couple of hiccups/misunderstandings, it overall built a very nice basis for a story, and certainly helped flesh out the characters. Jack Murdoch having his identity stolen and defrauded by the Odyssey black-hats, the relationship between M4X and Calvin, despite M4X being designed and comissioned by Planetary inspection Enterprises to be Calvin's replacement, enjoyable, organic backgrounds that grew out of that phase.<br/><br/>- The downside of faction creation is that, as a GM, you can't really plan a story before that aspect is done. I'll need to present an alternate system, like "The GM introduces a number of factions equal to the number of players, each player picks one and describes their Defining Event, and then passes it to the right for that character's Involvement." It would allow the GM to have a bit more control over the initial setting (say, if the GM had an idea for a story about space pirates attacking a deep-space scientific space station or whatever)<br/><br/>- Similarly, there's no control over Tone. The tone of the session grew organically out of the factions introduced by the players, but that might not have been the tone the players were looking for. When factions include slavery rings, cyber terrorism, human experimentation and secret facilities, it gives the game a certain tone of moral ambiguity and oppressive corporate interests. Cool stuff, but it certainly steers the GM's hand for the first few sessions.<br/><br/>- Being Sci-Fi, heroism is not exactly a reliable fall-back for character motivations. The idealism and firm morals of fantasy are replaced by self-interest and socio-political considerations. Not sure if that fits the Space Opera vibe though.<br/><br/>- I am happy with the way the players were engaged with the situation. It really felt like a tough choice, were some decisions which could have really sent it down a different path entirely. "What could we/they have done differently" kinda thing; Jo's Sift Information could have tilted things if she had chosen erase the fact that UPA agents had ever been there ("No one knows you're here. And they'd never find your body"). Calvin could have done something other than Shotgun Blaster the desperate colonist in the face. Jo could have done a Get Involved move to give Calvin's Open Fire a -2, which would have knocked it down to 8 (which means no automatic damage; Calvin would have needed to let the colonist take her shot and then do damage). Lots of little things.<br/><br/>- On that note, the "You deal damage but..." options in Open Fire and Assault should now read "You deal damage but the targets get to attack or act as well". This means they could flee, take cover, close in on you, or shoot at someone else, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/samtung" title="samtung"><img alt="samtung" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/829/n33T3S0X5GPDF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/samtung">samtung</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421511/#Comment_421511" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-14T16:55:40+00:00" title="September 14, 2013  4:55PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds pretty cool -- the unpredictable factions might be a good thing, overall, though?  I don't know if you've had a chance to try out "Microscope" but the way factions are built in "Uncharted Worlds" is pretty cool in that it gives the players such a hand in the worldbuilding and the story they want to play.  Dungeon World and the like seem to have such an emphasis on the DM NOT planning his campaign before starting, instead, "playing to find out what happens" as the PCs are the stars of the story.  <br/><br/>In Microscope, before anything else, the players kind of come up with a one-sentence summary of their whole history.  Maybe that would be a good way to get everyone on the same page here -- do you guys want to play a Star Trek exploration game?  A Firefly/Millenium Falcon smuggling game?  A Mass Effect paramilitary game?<br/><br/>Re: Heroism vs Moral Ambiguity -- similar to the muddiness of the factions, I'm not sure that' s a bad thing.  If you're going for Space Opera pulp it might not be appropriate, but if your sources of inspiration are things like Firefly or Mass Effect, a little moral grayness might fit right in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
