Their merriment was interrupted however by a explosion. Upon investigation they discovered that the smithy had been totally destroyed. Smoking pair of shoes for the Blacksmith etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter some investigation they were approached by an merchant who told them that the blacksmith was working some metal that he discovered off the Road of Broken Glass in the lands near the Crater of the Fallen God. The metal was pocked with gems and shone with a weird light and he was told by the smith that it could be made into an amazing set of armour. The merchant would gladly pay the adventurers an impressive amount of money if they were to travel to the smoking crater and retrieve more metal. How could they refuse.<br/>\n<br/>\nSetting off they reached the Forest of the Lonely Druid by nightfall but after Screwtail pissed in the druids bed the last time they were there they decided they would camp out rather than visit. Sadly they were assailed by a pack of carnivorous semi-intelligent Iron Monkeys in the night but after a few scrapes saw them off and hightailed it out of the woods towards the crater.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey reached the crater at night but decided that they would press on. They scrambled over the rubble and pressed through the rocks for the rest of the night, coming across nothing except a few tribal carvings making groaning metal noises. Confused, they pressed on and at morning they reached the lip of the crater to look down and see a palace had been built there! A beautiful towering city built from strange materials and populated by genderless, featureless automatons.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey decided to approach the automatons but the workers scarpered and a ball of fire came to greet them. Sadly, Pharos had a sparker moment which the guard took as an attack, spawned into a fully fledged Fire Elemental and attacked them. There was a lot of Assisting from Screwtail and the elemental was seen off but they didn't have time to rest on their victory as they were being pressed by more guards so they barrelled into the palace, with singed tails for their troubles.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey descended down into the depths of the palace, where they encountered more automatons, weird technology and eventually an Air Elemental guard which they beat - oh, and a doorway with strange glowing lights around it. Curiosity overwhelmed the fox, who dived through causing his fellows to follow.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey appeared before more automatons who they interrogated for a while about their purpose. They were aboard the Sky Chariot of the Great Hunter God Akuma! And yes, they were indeed, in space. Balan professed that there were no gods whilst Screwtail was adamant that the Fox god brought all good foxes a mate with many cubs. Before the philosophical debate could continue they were greeted by a human called Carin, who claimed to be the son of the Great Hunter God Akuma.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarin explained that Akuma and his kin travelled the void hunting dragons and the Black Dragonlord Bazal had landed on this sphere. He was currently burying into the planet and when he reached a deep enough level he would lay his egg in the planet and leave. When the egg hatched the planet would be destroyed and a new dragon would be born! Akuma would stop Bezal before he could destroy the sphere. He had gone down to settle his palace and then gather forces to assault Bezal - much as Bezal would gather forces to defend his egg.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlightly taken aback by all of this, the adventurers decided that they would leave. Fast. However Carin was quite taken with Screwtail - a species he had not seen before - and he wanted to examine him. Words like dissection were used. At this point everyone decided to fight their way out but Carin and his 20 mooks were beyond them and they were all KO'd. No-one died.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater they were awoken to discover they Carin had examined Screwtail but he was so impressed by the Foxes art with the bow they he realised he was way beyond animal and didn't operate.  Carin then confessed that he had not heard from Akuma for some time and he was concerned for his whereabouts. His sister, Darra, had decided to travel down to the sphere herself and carry on the hunt for Bezal but she would surely die.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow" title="Neil Gow"><img alt="Neil Gow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nS7S5AMIXMIH0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow">Neil Gow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138505/#Comment_138505" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-07T07:40:48+00:00" title="April  7, 2008  7:40AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 7, 2008 7:41AM by Neil Gow.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            He asked the players if THEY would find Akuma for him and tell him that his daughter had gone to finish the job he started. He promised the players riches beyond their wildest imaginations if they succeeded. Naturally, they agreed. Finally he gave them each a pendant to wear which would allow them in and out of the palace freely without troubling the elemental guards.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey travelled, with the metal they needed back to F'kd, collected their reward and then continued to the small village of Totalee. Totalee used to be part of F'kd until the Independent College of Invokers moved into it and F'ks shuffled across a little to get out of the way of the random magical explosions and sporadic mutations.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey visited the magical school (which is bigger on the outside than it is on the inside, after a particularly annoying mistake) looking for a scryer who could find the God Akuma. They went into the Scrying Tower (which is taller than it appears, but the College has never secured levitation funding). The Scrying team (wearing large lens arrays on their faces and looking through massive lens windows in their tower) placed in the rose-tinted filters and looked out for a god. Which they could not find. They looked everywhere for a number of things and could find nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was then that the players asked the scryers to look for the merchant they had been initially hired by and he was running from a giant black wyrm, attacking F'kd.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey were teleported back to F'kd (1 in 12 chance of losing a random stat for Teleport, I decided) and attacked the Wyrm, who was hammering home the message of the huge illusionary dragon in the middle of the town. 'All those who wish to live will join the army of the Black Dragonlord Bezal'<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Wyrm was a stern test of the team. Pharos couldn't hit the broadside of a barn. Screwtail lifted Balan and threw him onto the Wyrm. We had a small debate on whether a Bear with a Heavy Reach Club in a Wyrms maw was a Close or a Hazardous arena! The bear was chewed up and spat out. The Magus was clubbed down with a flick of the Wyrm's tail and finally it came to flying dogfight between Screwtail and The Wyrm, which the fox won... just.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecovering from their injuries and watching the people of F'ked picking over the remains of the corpse, the heroes reflected on the fact that they are the only ones who know the truth about what is about to happen to their world...<br/>\n<br/>\nCharacter Changes<br/>\n<br/>\nBalan added +1 Size and gained Yari Mastery (to combine with his Heavy Reach Weapon ... ouch)<br/>\nScrewtail added +1 Eloquence and gained Commanding Voice<br/>\nPharos added +1 Stubborness and gained Enchantment<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n<br/>\nGame reflections?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's still very fun to play and the system melts into the background pretty well. I used the 'harm' rules more this time around and they worked a treat. Balancing the monsters is still a skill that you have to learn rather than something that happens easily. Both Carin the Godspawn and The Black Wyrm were really hard work for the players but we reckoned that with the Warrior present they would have been easily overpowered (Long Shadow allowing him to tank)<br/>\n<br/>\nwe do have a situation with one of the characters, who is Screwtail the Fox. He has now taken Strategist and Commanding Voice, which allows him to use Eloquence for Assists. He now gets +8 in total to his Assist which means he can never fail to add Awesome Tokens to his party. He will never ever get involved in a combat unless he is the last person and on average he is adding 4 tokens a turn, without fail. Additionally he can fly, which means that I have to come up with some quite curious methods for people to hit him... every time.<br/>\n<br/>\n+1/+1 Awesome tokens work fine. No problem there. Inner Fire will have to be reworked so that it mirrors the nerfing of Awesome Tokens.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally the monster version of Blast doesn't have any additional damage on it, so it divides 1 between the adventurers that are hit. There should be some guidance (like 'round up' or minimum of 1). It only really became useful when the monster had Awesome Tokens.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd also like to see a Regeneration monster power. Just a simple 'The monster regains 1 HP at the beginning of each round of combat'                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow" title="Neil Gow"><img alt="Neil Gow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nS7S5AMIXMIH0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow">Neil Gow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138507/#Comment_138507" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-07T07:49:23+00:00" title="April  7, 2008  7:49AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And finally, the monsters!<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Carin the Godspaw- 40xp</b><br/>\n(Sort of like a white haired young mage type of arrogant and aloof space travelling pseudo God thing)<br/>\n<br/>\nAL: +2<br/>\nDA: +5<br/>\nEL: +5<br/>\nSN: +0<br/>\nSZ: +0<br/>\nST: +3<br/>\n<br/>\nHP: 10  AC:12<br/>\n<br/>\nWeapon: Reach (Staff of Powerz)<br/>\nPowers: Mist Summoner, Hard To See, Flight, Blast, Minions (he had 20 mooks)<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Guardian Elementals - 20xp</b><br/>\n<br/>\nAL: +4<br/>\nDA: +4<br/>\nEL: +0<br/>\nSN: +0<br/>\nSZ: +2<br/>\nST: +2<br/>\n<br/>\nHP: 10  AC:10<br/>\n<br/>\nWeapon: Ranged (Thrown Elemental Stuff - fireballs, rocks or wind blasts)<br/>\nPowers: Natural Weapons, Impressive Weaponry<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Black Wyrm - XP 45<br/>\nAL: +0<br/>\nDA: +5<br/>\nEL: +0<br/>\nSN: +0<br/>\nSZ: +10<br/>\nST: +5<br/>\n<br/>\nHP: 10  AC:14<br/>\n<br/>\nWeapon: Heavy (snapping jaw)<br/>\nPowers: Flight, Frenzied, Thick Skin x2, Internal Fire<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138655/#Comment_138655" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-08T05:53:45+00:00" title="April  8, 2008  5:53AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hiya Neil, thanks for your play report.

Now, with this part at level three (with the addition of the level two warrior), between the Fox (adding an average of four Awesome per turn) and the Magus (using his +5 stubbornness adding say an average of 2 per turn) to the Bear (with Heavy Reach and Yari Master), a monster with AC10 is looking in all probability of taking around say, at least 4-5 damage a turn. It's damage will always be transfered to the <strike>Warrior </strike>Tank via Long Shadow, so a vanilla monster has about 2-3 turns to dish out 8 points of damage before it is toast. Say it has a Heavy weapon and is lucky? It might take the Warrior down in four turns? By which time the Bear has kebabed it.  So we throw in some Minions to soak up the damage? Minions are dropping at oh ... say 4-5 a turn? The warrior is down and the bear has dropped say 18 minions in the same time - thats quite the meat shield?!<br/>\n<br/>\nEssentially what I think it illustrates is that as the players get more savvy of the tactics and learn to focus their awesome through their best 'dps' character for one MASSIVE hit powered by awesome, it predetermines the powers that become obligatory when building monsters. AC10 simply does not cut the mustard. Neither does 1 damage a turn - the monster damage has to be more than that in this scenario, much more.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext time, I think I will turn the tables and have some NPCs 'Assisting' the monster and see how they like it?!<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/andreww" title="andreww"><img alt="andreww" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/andreww">andreww</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138879/#Comment_138879" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-09T13:57:26+00:00" title="April  9, 2008  1:57PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 9, 2008 1:58PM by andreww.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Posted By: vodkashokNext time, I think I will turn the tables and have some NPCs 'Assisting' the monster and see how they like it?!<br>\n<br>\nI think we saw the outcome of that last time when Cari showed off followed by a Blast which knocked a couple of us out.  <br>\n<br>\nNext level is Weapon Bond, 4 dice a round, all of them face dice with base damage of 2, nasty.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
