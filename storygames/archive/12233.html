Hi!</p>\n<p>Neat article. Much of what's being discussed there is interaction between our different brains, in this case the amygdala and cerebral cortex. The Amygdala controls most of our fear responses, for instance, and for good reason, gets a veto on actions that our slower, cortical processes might still think are safe. Tenths of a second often count in those situations, such as not falling off a cliff, or being eaten by a lion. The laughter of tickling (mock attacks) or the mock-anger play with the baby in that article are where the decision for your cortex is getting simple enough that it reacts fast enough to countermand most, but not all, of the fear response.</p>\n<p>I find that the more horrible the events of a story that I'm interacting with, the more I'll laugh. This happens in Shock: all the time, and is actually a big part of the system. The cruel sense of humor of the Audience is a lot of what makes the game go, and they want to see tragedy. They want to <em>laugh</em> at tragedy. Like they laugh at being tickled or someone obviously feigning anger.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_274275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/docholaday" title="docholaday"><img alt="docholaday" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/docholaday">docholaday</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274275/#Comment_274275" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-03T09:51:27+00:00" title="June  3, 2010  9:51AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "I find that the more horrible the events of a story that I'm interacting with, the more I'll laugh."<br/><br/>Yep. This is true of me as well. And not just in response to stories. I have embarrassed myself by responding to a real-life tragic situation with chuckling or an inappropriate (and spontaneous) wisecrack before. It's a knee-jerk reaction like having a giggling fit at a funeral. I was teaching college one day and walked into my classroom to see the burning Trade Towers on a wall-mounted TV. I had no idea what I was seeing for a few minutes and I recall that I made some joke while my brain was scrambling to figure out what the hell was on the tube. I then had to apologize to the class for my reaction. I'm pretty sure I didn't interpret the images as real at first.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>BTW, this bit you are relating about parts of the brain and reaction times really sits well with some of the things discussed in the book <i>The Drunkard's Walk</i>. I found that to be a spectacular read on the subject of randomness and how badly our perceptions are geared toward understanding true randomness. (Also how infrequently real randomness actually occurs above the level of quantum physics.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274288/#Comment_274288" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-03T10:40:12+00:00" title="June  3, 2010 10:40AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2010 10:40AM by lordgoon.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very nice article.
