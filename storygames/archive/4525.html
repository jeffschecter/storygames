I wrote about the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4466" rel="nofollow">first one</a> last week. <br/><br/>It's an intro class and most of the participants are new to improv. We have been doing several exercises each time, and are learning about related concepts a bit at  at time.  This week we worked a bit with two ideas:  "Yes, and..." and having an audience. <br/><br/><b>Yes, and...</b> We first did a straight up "yes, and.." exercise. We sat in a circle on the floor, someone started us off by offering the person next to her something, and we each had to accept the offer and add to it. By offer, I mean they described something, in this case hamburger meat to be made into a patty. The next person (the instructor) added in broken glass. This made it both more interesting to deal with, and harder to accept.  The next person tried to block by saying the glass was really orange peels, but then ended up just adding orange peels instead. <br/><br/>We also did a circle of "No, buts...", describing what an object the instructor had brought was <b>really</b> used for, which gave good contrast. It was a small object on a braided rainbow string which got described as a tooth holder for the tooth fairy, fairy rescue boat, and a painting implement respectively. We'd been encouraged to hold expert authority on the object, so the last person got major points (so to speak) for saying that the object had been the subject of a scientific convention that had been held for 2 weeks and 3 days..after which they conclusively decided it had no use whatsoever. Very funny. <br/><br/>Graham talks about <a href="http://www.catchyourhare.com/journal/?p=19" rel="nofollow">blocking</a> and <a href="http://www.catchyourhare.com/journal/?p=24" rel="nofollow">accepting</a> on his improv blog. I thought there was a post about "yes, and..." but there isn't one specifically. That "and" is so important. It's what allows you to help eachother build a scene out of nothing. We did a series of two person scenes where this was the goal. The "audience" (the rest of us) gave a relationship between the characters, a place and a situation, then the players went with it, intentionally using the yes, and.. principle.  <br/><br/>The first scene was a mother-daughter duo in a library, stealing books.  Who played who was decided in the scene by an offer from one of the players. "Mom, why don't we just use a library card like everybody else?"  The other player responded by saying it was a family tradition and asking the child to put another book under her jacket.  So the other player mimed holding a huge pile of books under her coat etc.   <br/><br/>The final sketch of these was hysterical. The relationship was a couple, the place the zoo, the situation: discussing their impending divorce.  Hard to hold the tension between the characters and yet accept all the offers. Very interesting to watch.  One partner eventually suggested that the other climb into the monkey cage, which the other accepted by saying it was just like another time in which they'd locked them inside and they'd stayed with the chimps for 2 weeks! <br/><br/><b>Playing to an audience</b>  - the instructor talked about "cheating out", facing your body at a 45 degree angle, so you can face your fellow player, as well as the audience and make eye contact easily with both. The intent being to remember to address what you say to the audience, since they are the real target, as well as to be able to keep engaged with your fellow player.  Other issues, like speaking loudly and clearly, never turning your back on the audience.  <br/><br/>It made me really appreciate the difference between role playing and improv. Having an audience changes things in many ways, simply from a logistics standpoint, and I am sure from an energetic and narrative standpoint as well. What is interesting to do may be dull as ditchwater to watch.  And, of course, improv audiences are often involved in the process, giving ideas, cheering or being bored etc.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102447/#Comment_102447" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-11T10:00:37+00:00" title="October 11, 2007 10:00AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, how interesting.

The punching and blocking tango only gets repetitive if both parties are bent on offering nothing new after the first "yes, and" exchange.  This also stems directly from that lovely place where players are so focused on the idea of their character's "success" that they hijack the story and the scene.  If no one is willing to offer their own failure or accept a setback, then it's just not interesting to me. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Edited for smiley.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ptevis" title="ptevis"><img alt="ptevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ptevis">ptevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102568/#Comment_102568" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-11T18:36:14+00:00" title="October 11, 2007  6:36PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Emily Care</cite>The jury's still out for me on the interpretation of the "yes".

That is, you will often give the other person multiple ways to agree with you, depending on what they're most comfortable with.<br/><br/>And you're right, the "and" is absolutely vital. Without the "and" you unhelpful agreement. With the "and" you actually build the scene together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102713/#Comment_102713" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-12T10:44:48+00:00" title="October 12, 2007 10:44AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>One of the things that you'll likely discover is that good offers (sort of things that the other person says "yes, and" to) will often have a sort of open-ended shape to them.

I can imagine it is partly because, you're helping the other person broaden the circle of ideas that you can play with in the scene, so if you offer something that they can only go one way with, then it is a narrow offer, and less likely to help them hit on the next good thing that they have in mind.  <br/><br/>It's funny how small offers can be really successful, though. There was one scene that came out of a game of Freeze Tag we played (starting from being placed in some arbitrary position with another person, you make up a scene that would fit it, then when someone else sees a potential scene in a new set of positions you are in, they call out "Freeze", tag someone out, and jump in to start the new scene with them as a part of it.)  <br/><br/>In this scene, one person had her hands spread out in front of her, and the other person said something about her having just done her nails.  So she started blowing on them, and then asked the other person (a fellow) to blow on one of her hands.  He said something about her having painted her toes too, and she *asked him to blow on her foot*.  Oh my goodness. So he bends down, takes her leg in one hand and starts blowing on them like nothing was ever strange about that.  It was a great position to switch to something else, but we all just wanted the scene to keep going. There was so much tension in it, because she had asserted her dominance, and held it ("so where are we going to eat?" she asks in a way that implies he's supposed to find somewhere good).  <br/><br/>This was a clear status play, and it was amazing how appealing it was, for how little actually happened.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102744/#Comment_102744" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-12T13:09:46+00:00" title="October 12, 2007  1:09PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, this is great.

It was super fun. When it works (and it mostly did that day) you feel really creative and *present*.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a fun thing about about improv. At the university we were a couple of rpg nerds, always, always talking about roleplaying. At one time we started to play with a couple of female classmates, who had no roleplaying experience at all. Anna had done a lot of improv in her youth, like weekly for a few years I think. And when she started to play with us she was really enthusiastic, but she was always like "I don't understand why you guys call this roleplaying. I can't see any difference between this and improv." <br/>\n<br/>\nAdmittedly we didn't only play traditional games, we also played a lot of Nordic larp (and a tiny little bit of freeform) and when we play trad the gm might say "Play this out" and you have to stand up, look each other in the eye and play something out. There are of course some substantial differences. I don't think you ever do four hour scenes (or forty or hundred) in improv. In most forms of roleplaying (admittedly not all) you tend to focus more on enhancing your own experience, while in improv there is more focus on the acting. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, her reaction was very interesting and she kept saying it for a long time. Now I think she does more roleplaying than any of us (I do nothing except online Ars Magica!). It is also very interesting that there are people here doing improv, but seem to separate it from roleplaying! For me it either *is* roleplaying or something so close that just extending playing time and character identification would make it so. Why not incorporate it (maybe you do)?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe improv ideas 'blocking' and 'accepting' have actually made their way into a lot of Nordic larps. you will often see these exact terms in the introductory text you get before the game about how to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I feel the goodness in your 'nail' example. I have just been thinking about these thing: you can get powerful insights in character relationships from full physical play. While trad verbal play is a great tool for creating story lines and forcing players to character decisions there are things like this that actually matters that are just very hard to really get to in verbal games. I have been thinking about a text about this for the knife fight. Plus, the no-touching rule would really have screwed this scene up!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sven" title="sven"><img alt="sven" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sven">sven</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102862/#Comment_102862" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-13T02:20:22+00:00" title="October 13, 2007  2:20AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n"For me it either *is* roleplaying or something so close that just extending playing time and character identification would make it so.

Graham's just cutting on the edge, as usual. <br/><br/>The two forms seem fairly distinct to me, although that may just be because of how they are applied, and because of underlying assumptions of the practitioners. Like you say improv is brief, with "long form" commonly being 20 minutes long, and some lasting bare moments.  Also the continuity of plot and character of rpg are quite distinct from most improv. Until you start getting to very long forms, such as the improv soap opera that Paul Tevis' group has been doing. I think that has a 16 week run, plus workshopping prior.  (Paul how's that going? Time for an update?)  Paul and Remi talk about both the diferences and the similarities, or applicabilities of improv to rp on Have Games Will Gravel (shows 97&amp;98, I think).  <br/><br/>Personally, I think that improv folk are doing interesting things. The exercises are fun, and hone your responses in ways that improve your ability to work collaboratively with others.  I'm fond of live play--your point about the physical embodiment of a role making different things visible or possible is a good one, I think. Using body position to inspire a scene, as we did in Freeze Tag, is a great experience-it gets you looking at wholly different things than one would normally focus on in play.  And I'm not surprised that block/accept have been incorporated into the nordic larp scene. They are fundamental to play, especially when you are working with minimal mechanical support. <br/><br/>I keep thinking, during my class, how fun it is and how much fellow story-gamers might enjoy the improv exercises.  I wonder if we could get a workshop together for Dreamation. It would be great on its own, especially if we do get some free form and jeep form games going (which I'm planning on).  That would be a great intro for folks who want to move from table top to live play, as it helped warm folks up for freeform at the con you went to, Sven.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sven" title="sven"><img alt="sven" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sven">sven</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102891/#Comment_102891" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-13T09:57:40+00:00" title="October 13, 2007  9:57AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Emily,<br/>\n<br/>\n"The two forms seem fairly distinct to me, although that may just be because of how they are applied, and because of underlying assumptions of the practitioners. Like you say improv is brief, with "long form" commonly being 20 minutes long, and some lasting bare moments. Also the continuity of plot and character of rpg are quite distinct from most improv."<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I have noticed these things about improv. And I have always been a bit surprised of why they continue it to do it that way... But yeah, there is a huge difference in the underlying goals I, even though certain types of larp or freeform games at moments might on the surface look very similar to improv, the whole reason for going there is different. Roleplayers usually want to explore something other than their own expression, be it character, theme, story or world. (I realize now that this sounds like a bad version of something Ron Edwards wrote a thousand years ago. But I just think that means that he is right.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have never before heard of improv like that soap opera you mention. Sounds very much like role playing to me, even if I imagine that the goals of play might be bit different. For example I guess they have a non-playing audience that they care about. It is still theatre, I guess, which creates another dynamic. I remember one larp where one (rather well-know) larper explained his thrills of the game afterwards. During the game the character had receieved some kind of evidence that he had a certain ancestry, which in the view of character was very problematic. The player had planned this himself, but it was new for his character. He showed the letter to no one and he explained afterwards how his character worried so much that he got a stomach pain himself. He considered a huge success that he could trick his own body into this reation, while it lead to now play whatsoever. Nordic immersion for you and not an ounce of theatre! (And I can't understand that type of immersion, neither.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI should also add that the Johnstone books have been quoted in different parts of the Nordic scene for as long as I have been around (one should ask Tobias about how long they have been used. I know he used to dislike the use of them quite fiercely.) I think it can be very interesting when people with Story Now-background goes into these techniques. I mean: people inspired by the Turkku school of immersion, which a lot of the Nordic theorists are, might be a bit crappy at story crafting! I am really eager to the first Forge diaspora games utilizing improv techniques live play. (or are there already some stuff?)<br/>\n<br/>\n"And I'm not surprised that block/accept have been incorporated into the nordic larp scene. They are fundamental to play, especially when you are working with minimal mechanical support."<br/>\n<br/>\nImmersionist purists would of course not accept that kind of rules, since they don't seem to accept more than 'stay true to your character'. But I don't think you can really find them outside of Turkku these days;-). Story is the new black. It is really true that all the Swedish art house larps during the last years seem to incorporate more and more of non-diegetic techniques (or immersion breaking, as some would have it). This is good.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tobias%20Wrigstad" title="Tobias Wrigstad"><img alt="Tobias Wrigstad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tobias%20Wrigstad">Tobias Wrigstad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102916/#Comment_102916" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-13T14:33:10+00:00" title="October 13, 2007  2:33PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Long time, Sven.</p>\n<p>I'm not a larper, but I've seen references to Johnstone's book since around 1994.

It is so limiting to all kinds of play. It's been natural and important in the improv scenes, not to mention jeep play. I'm wondering how to deal with greater contact in the American context.

For most people of my generation (admittedly not me, but I am rather an exception) kissing or making out with random people to make a game work wouldn't be a very strange thing (although personally I couldn't do anything close to that while I am in the relationship I am in right now and plan to be in for a rather immense amount of time).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut you are on the right track when you say "There must be minute body-language communicated negotiations for that", even though it isn't necessarily that complicated. I can't talk about these things in Jeepform and other types of freeform since I have never had to deal with it there personally. But in general these things are not seen as a big problem in those forms since the amount of people is so small and you always have full overview of the whole game. If there is something you don't want to do you *can* always escape by doing a short narration or so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn larp, though these problems are always addressed (I wouldn't attend one that doesn't). In the larps (which all are non-fantasy and could probably all be put into the art house category, although I will try to visit a Vampire larp any year now) I have been to they have also addressed it in a rather uniform way, although I know about a lot of varieties. The most common and simplest rules are that you have one word to completely stop a scene and one word to 'lessen the intensity' - physical or verbal. These simple measures will be enough to get rid of the bad stuff. Normally these games allow both making out and some amount of physical violence, (and actually also sex, even if this to my knowledge never happened on the games I have been to, that's for the really 'arty' people I guess) on the premise that it can at any point be reversed very simple.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis way of doing it might of course lead to a lot of bad play, since you are uncertain what the other players want to do and you are uncertain what they think you want to do.  That is not optimum play. (I had actually one scene like that in a larp where I played a gay character and I had finally seduced the guy my character had been working on for ten years. Had it been up to me I would have just made out with him there to enhance the game, (I am only conservative as long as it pertains to women, incidentally) luckily I understood that the other player wouldn't go there, but the uncertainty created a bit of a action vaccum. In the art-house games you often have transparancy to some degree, (and 50 rather than the 1000 of fantasy larps) so that you can discuss on beforehand on exactly where you want to go, which often is the best thing possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeveral games I have been to (all larps arranged by people from \xc3\u2013rebro, as it happens) have had the rules of no fighting (some actually got special permission to fight, but that's another thing) and no sexual advances whatsoever. If it fits the game then it's a good thing. In certain circumstances you just now that those things would give very little value, then the easy way out will be the most valuable.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, if you want to keep the possibility of physical in-game sexuality and still keep conservative (fin i kanten, as we say) players like me in play you have to come up with something better. There are a lot of discussions on this available and if you havent read, you should. I am not the person to talk about it, but there are models. They all include touching, but in rather controllable ways. We Nordic larp people like to talk about the Ars Amandi method, if you don't know about this I will scavange a link tomorrow. Some larps have simple system where you decide that all touching (for example) below the neck except the arms are banned, but on the other hand touching between elbows and shoulders have an explicit sexual meaning. This obviously work for some people. I know they used some non-diegetic technique for playing out sexual encounters in some instances at A Nice Evening with the Family (God, I wish I could have been there).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tobias%20Wrigstad" title="Tobias Wrigstad"><img alt="Tobias Wrigstad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tobias%20Wrigstad">Tobias Wrigstad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103003/#Comment_103003" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-14T12:48:24+00:00" title="October 14, 2007 12:48PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Ars amandi isn't very good IMHO. Basically, you can touch each other's arms and shoulders as a way of simulating sex. Methods like that just doesn't cut it in my book. AA worked in the game for which it was conceived as the arms were diagetically sexual (which allowed for other nice things, but that's an orthogonal issue), but that's done. Let's move on.</p>\n<p>In A Nice Evening, we used dance improv to simulate sex, which worked so much better, even though I admit to being sceptical purely on account of me being a huge coward when it comes to dancing. We played sweaty tangos and danced the shit out of people. They even got "post-fuck hair" (don't know what English for "knullrufs" might be) afterwards, which was very in-game as they stumbled into the larp sweaty, with a pulse, and bad hair. Great.</p>\n<p>Dance improv is nice -- it pretty much forces touching, but it is a dance so touching is allowed according to social protocol. And you can really do nice metaphors with it -- who is leading, is it rough, etc. Very very good stuff. I'm happy I got to see it in action, and I'm hoping to use it in an upcoming jeep game (A Perfect Evening), but I see trouble using it outside larp.

It's a much bigger problem in larp setting, where it's not always possible to prepare on beforehand with people you want to interact with. But still, in all cases these are important questions, it's important that all players are comfortable with these issues, so that they can be made uncomfortable with other! <br/><br/>If i have something clever to say I will speak again, otherwise I will be quiet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103091/#Comment_103091" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-15T10:29:18+00:00" title="October 15, 2007 10:29AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sven, I'm glad you are responding!

I'll write about that when I get a chance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sven" title="sven"><img alt="sven" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sven">sven</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103098/#Comment_103098" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-15T11:28:44+00:00" title="October 15, 2007 11:28AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It just struck me that I should clearify one point:<br/><br/>Emily:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Emily Care</cite><br/>Cut/Brems (brake)? Does this work well without breaking the flow of a scene?  This goes completely against the "Yes, and.." grain of improv, of course. What are the agreements about touch in most improv classes? Do folks talk about that, or is it worked out unofficially group by group?</blockquote>\nMe:<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sven</cite>"Cut/Brems (brake)? Does this work well without breaking the flow of a scene?"<br/><br/>No, it doesn't go well. They aren't smooth techniques, it's red light techniques. Fun that you know the terms! Kutt, (cut) Brems (brake) (I think both are Norwegian words, at least Brems, I don't know if I spelled the first one correctly).<br/></blockquote>\nBut, even though they are clumsy they make a huge improvement, even when not used. This is because they provide a very simple and clearcut way of intervention from the side of the player, if needed. It gives you more freedom and you can go further. I have only played one larp where this (or something very similar) was't clearly state on beforehand and that actually created a couple of unnecessary problems. (The game was wonderful in spite of this, but that's due to player goodness in spite of this.) <br/><br/>It is of course much better if you in addition to this have a more elaborated agreement, that's what we should strive for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
