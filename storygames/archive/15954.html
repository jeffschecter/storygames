Would anyone interested in helping? We will be acknowledging all contributions in the PDF and personally if I see you.<br/><br/>First, we would love to find some art to sprinkle through the project to make it look nice. Although I'd love some slick art for the project, it doesn't have to be professional or semi-professional. Just free. B-) Do you have any art, sketches, maps, etc you'd be willing to donate to a good cause?<br/><br/>We are also looking for people to write vignettes to open chapters, crowd-source edit, light play-testing, promotion on blogs or podcasts, hosting for the document on a welcoming website, etc. If you have anything that could make this more successful please let me know.<br/><br/>For now we are just putting together a list of contributors. They will have access to the PDF in beta and are welcome to run with playing it. If you find anything noteworthy good or bad please let me know. If you discuss the project on your blog or podcast also let me know as I will be putting these on the site. If you find a problem with something and are discussing it publicly please be sure to mention that this is a beta and it may not be in the final PDF.<br/><br/>We will not be making the the PDF available publicly until we are finished. There is no hard and fast time frame although I'd like to have this available for Gencon and Dragoncon. We would love to have your help.

Before I begin, please know that I am new to Fate. In fact, the game at GenCon was my first. Prior to playing, however, I had read through Spirit of the Century and Dresden Files. <br/><br/>As an Amber fan, I love the setting, and Scott's adventure definitely satisfied my craving for a dose of Amber. The pre-gen characters were children of characters from the novel, so they tied in well with existing relationships from the novel, and the adventure itself took place largely in Amber. <br/><br/>I enjoyed the fate point mechanics. The game really seems to do a great job of promoting role-playing. I focused on three or four of my aspects throughout the adventure, finding ways to make them relevant and meaningful. Most of the other players did likewise. I would like to learn more about and gain experience with tagging scenes and other characters. <br/><br/>Scott was a good GM. He had a good plan, but he was also flexible. I introduced a plot twist before he even got started with the adventure, and he rolled with it and incorporated the twist into the adventure. When we were introducing our characters to the group, I invoked an aspect ("He has a hole in his heart where his mother should be") by talking to one of the other characters, the spymaster, about a dilemma I had: I wanted a particular woman, but she wouldn't have anything to do with me. Could the spymaster help me out? My pursuit of this woman became a secondary plot line in the adventure, even resulting in a brief physical scuffle between my character and another character. <br/><br/>One problem we had was that most of the players were unfamiliar with the setting. Scott did a good job briefing them on the setting, but even so, Amber is a lot to take in. Fortunately, most of the players were good role players. Even though the setting was new to them, many did a great job rolling with it. <br/><br/>I can think of a couple suggestions: I'd like to see a very brief Amber player reference (1 page) that includes the ruling family, their personalities,the main locations, and a summary of the metaphysics of Amber. I'd also like to see a very brief Fudge/Fate player reference (1 page). Such references would facilitate playing with Fate-newbies and people who haven't read any Amber books.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/finarvyn" title="finarvyn"><img alt="finarvyn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/finarvyn">finarvyn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411416/#Comment_411416" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-05T18:29:11+00:00" title="April  5, 2013  6:29PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd be interested in helping and/or playtesting with this project, but I see that this thread is now several months old.
