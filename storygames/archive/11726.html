I haven't typically enjoyed playing or GMing a lot of mucking around in town looking for adventure hooks. As a GM, I don't like trying to houserule a bunch of mechanics for making friends in town when the game is clearly designed for killing goblins and dodging around traps. As a player, I don't like waiting for the Cleric to finish his long theological discussion with the town priest when I'm already outfitted for the adventure.<br/><br/>But on the other hand, play is so clearly better when everyone has a reason to buy into the fact that this bunch of adventurers is going off to a terribly dangerous place looking for something. I like it as a GM, and I like it as a player.<br/><br/>When you run adventure-based games, how do you handle what happens outside the adventure. Is it just an extension of the adventure using the same rules and procedures? Or are there particular practices and mechanics you use outside the dungeon that you don't use inside. I know Eero mentioned he's got a way of dealing with this, and I'd love to hear it.

My longest D&amp;D campaign used a specific inn-based procedure: the players would make certain city-based information gathering moves, and I'd give them a list of rumours from a pre-prepared list on the basis of their effectiveness in this work-mongering. The information collection would then result in a number of different types of adventure hooks, among which the players would choose which to go after. These hooks would differ in terms of reliability, level of danger, consequences for ignoring, character-based relevance and so on, so the adventuring party would have to argue among themselves whether they should investigate a potential danger to the city, uncertain rumours about an enemy cult or other priorities.</blockquote>\nA few questions: did you prepare just one adventure, then provide clues and information towards it, or did you provide multilpe hooks then let the players choose between them? How much input did players have on where the characters went next and why? How did these choices impact the play experience you were trying for?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261656/#Comment_261656" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-12T10:00:43+00:00" title="March 12, 2010 10:00AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tony, are you asking about:<br/>a) when the player characters first meet and decide to band together for some shared purpose<br/>b) when a solidly formed group of player characters is in between adventures<br/>c) both?<br/><br/>With Delve, for (b), I do something similar in spirit to Eero's thing.

I didn't prepare the adventure itself, only a strong central image and a rumour leading to it. The actual adventure would be improvised on the spot, largely, or prepared for the next session. I would typically prepare new hooks and develop old ones whenever the group returned to base (1-3 sessions most of the time), at which point I'd compile whatever I had into a list of 20-40 more or less pertinent rumours about the city that was the mandated base of the adventurer group. (Mandated because the campaign's premise was specifically to focus on the adventurer's guild of this particular city.) The players would then gain access to a variable number of these more or less public news/rumours/secrets, and make their further choices based on this information. Of course my list of adventure ideas would be influenced by whatever I considered interesting myself; there was plenty of background plot going on that the characters never touched on except in news they heard about town.<br/><br/>Just preparing one adventure and starting the game from the inn in town is a bit forced, it seems to me. I just recently read a '90s D&amp;D adventure that did this sort of thing, I found it funny how the text adviced the GM to "have a talk with the players about the meaning of heroism" if they refused to follow the plaintive villager seeking for their aid. If you only have the one adventure, then why pretend that there's choice or maneuver involved? Much better to start the game from the dungeon entrance and tell the background in a flashback or something. "You've all agreed to help the burgomeister by finding and slaying the evil manwolf plaguing the countryside" is perfectly passable, no reason to start at the inn.<br/><br/>When I did the inn thing, the players were completely, totally in control of where they'd go next and what would happen. They obviously communicated this clearly to me, so I could think about it in advance; if necessary, I'd take a 15 minute break to sketch something out while the players prepared food or something. Sometimes this sort of adventure would run pretty short, other times it would span several sessions, so that the party returned to base after a longer time to find that the rumour landscape of opportunities had changed meanwhile.<br/><br/>As for how this approach to the campaign influenced the play experience... that's an interesting question. I would have to say that some players were definitely bothered by my overall methodology, and thus dropped out of the campaign after a bit. There was little guarantee of character safety, progressing plot or ensured protagonism; only characters and players willing to develop clear goals and go after them with gusto actually get anything done in this sort of game, as the GM doesn't actively ensure that anything and everything they do succeeds. This leads to what one might characterize as spot-light hogging, I guess; some players play more interesting characters who actually have goals, and thus the game starts to revolve around those characters and their goals, while the rest of the group become sidekicks. This doesn't really have anything to do with power-level or game balance, either; the payoff is purely in taking risks, making grand plans and acting in ways that actually result in interesting developments that showcase the character and the setting.<br/><br/>I could well imagine starting a new campaign around similar premises today. I'd probably use a hex crawl geography to complement this time around; I wasn't too informed about D&amp;D practices a decade ago, so many of the obviously cool techniques didn't occur to me at the time. Having a map that'd accumulate detail would have been obviously cool for a campaign of the sort we did, with plenty of travel between cities and cultures. I was also too tolerant of problem behavior as a GM, mostly because the game was partly intended as an open campaign for the local roleplaying club. Still, what we had at the time was highly successful, I think - we only ended the campaign because I moved out of Helsinki, and the group is still together, merrily playing D&amp;D and other games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261720">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tavis" title="Tavis"><img alt="Tavis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tavis">Tavis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261720/#Comment_261720" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-12T14:32:10+00:00" title="March 12, 2010  2:32PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The New York Red Box campaigns have evolved an approach where deciding what goal to pursue at the next session of adventure is largely done online, and the bulk of in-person play time is spent adventuring based around that goal. It's not strictly West Marches - I don't require people to have decided on a goal before we schedule the next date, and Eric (the group's other campaign GM) will go ahead and decide himself  "you guys are going to the Ghost Tower" or whatever if a decision hasn't been reached by a stated deadline.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis does produce the spotlight hogging that Eero mentions: some players are much more proactive in their goals. There's also a related disparity between how much people master the accumulated lore of the campaign: if you've played in a lot of sessions consistently, and keep up with all the online discussion, you'll have a much clearer sense of what's going on and why. However, ours are also open campaigns; the average session has some people who've played 8+ sessions and some who've done 0-2 before. My sense is that the focus on the adventure mission is easy for a new player to come to grips with, and even if they don't follow the meaning of the old-timers discussions ("could the marilith be behind this? how will the Patriarch respond?")  I think that does give a sense that there is a deeper meaning behind the often gonzo heist sequences of play at the table.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also think that handling the what-happens-between-scenes-to-set-up-the-next-adventure stuff online has a higher tolerance for spotlight hogging. We often have big groups of 10+ players, so there's not a lot I can do to make sure everyone has spotlight time; instead I just try to create situations that will be challenging for the group as a whole, knowing that the people who want individual attention can seek it online by posting about their plans for carousing, gathering information, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne West Marches tenet we do follow is that the party has to return to a civilized area at the end of each session of adventure. As I've adapted to the pacing of this, it's created a template that I find very satisfying. The party decides where to go (typically into a dungeon, but once into a city that I treated like a dungeon by emphasizing dangerous random encounters and the possibility of getting lost, having to explore other routes when the street on their map was blocked, etc.). Tension rises as they leave the area they've previously explored and start getting further and further away from the exit. In the early part of the session, there's a lot of paranoia; people spend half an hour deciding how to deal with a trap or avoid being detected by the enemy. As the end of the session draws nearer, caution is thrown to the winds in an urgency to find some treasure and get out. My tenets as a sandbox DM mean I don't have a lot of control over pacing - I won't throw an encounter at them just because the action is dragging, for example - but in the majority of recent sessions this natural tendency to accelerate near the end causes them to blunder into something they're not at all ready to fight, so that the flow of each session is make preparations for the trip -&gt; travelogue through known regions -&gt; build tension through paranoia about dangers -&gt; add contrasting tension due to real-world time pressure -&gt; explosively release tension as everyone runs screaming for the exits. (Last three sessions, the agents of their flight have been a ghost that aged one of them 70 years as he fled; a demon that materialized in the manor of a lich they'd accidentally killed; and an immortal lizard-king that conjured a tentacled brain-thing. Note also that another part of the pacing is that at the start of the session they might have stayed to fight these things, or retreated only long enough to re-engage; it's not so much that each session climaxes in an encounter with something they can't beat, as that as time runs out they try to do more and more until they encounter something that narratively justifies the headlong exit from the dungeon that our meta-rules require).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261721">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261721/#Comment_261721" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-12T14:32:22+00:00" title="March 12, 2010  2:32PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>Tony, are you asking about:<br>a) when the player characters first meet and decide to band together for some shared purpose<br>b) when a solidly formed group of player characters is in between adventures<br>c) both?<br/></br></br></br></blockquote>\nDefinitely C!

If you know what motivates them, and have at least one instance of that clamoring for attention on the map, you'll never hit a dead end.<br/><br/>Or are dead ends not the problem?<br/><br/>As for (a) starting from scratch, I think a certain amount of "we're here to do something compatible" must be established before char-gen.  Once you have that, start play with the characters having just met and agreed to do that compatible thing, in the manner that such meetings and agreements occur in your setting.  Nothing wrong with a "help wanted" sign.  After that, as GM, you should aspire to entangle the PCs in your web of hooks/leads/promises as quickly as possible.  Fling potential friends, enemies, allies, resources, costs, etc. at them until something sticks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261726/#Comment_261726" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-12T14:59:04+00:00" title="March 12, 2010  2:59PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tavis,<br/><br/>I love what "end somewhere safe" does for the game, but man, I'd have trouble fleeing a cool encounter because of the clock.

We buy a round of drinks in the inn, do some short interviews, the DM rolls reaction, and dudes get hired or not.<br><br>Then we go to the dungeon, get trapped inside, complain about how we are always stuck in the dungeon at the end of the session, get together for a second session, and finally get out of the dungeon with a small amount of XP and a few less retainers.<br><br>After that, we do a little bit of stuff at the end, before we go through hiring retainers again. We have now started using some carousing rules, so the cleric burned down the inn and got to second level at the end of one session, and then contributed some money towards rebuilding it at the start of the last session.<br><br>One of our DM tried giving out rumours to us before, but we have tended to ignore a lot of stuff outside of the dungeons. And the other DM just wants to concentrate on the dungeons, and not stuff that happens in town. Although I have made some jokes about raising hell in town. Like, the cleric ended up spending 500gp on his party, and I wanted the next dungeon to be the innkeeper's house, ha ha.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261753/#Comment_261753" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-12T19:11:48+00:00" title="March 12, 2010  7:11PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: tony dowler</cite>when I'm already outfitted for the adventure.</blockquote>\nMaybe this is the problem.<br><br>What if character creation &amp; inn slumming were intrinsically interwoven?<br><br>Like, instead of just picking out your equipment from a list, you actually had to go and talk to the weaponsmith and buy it?<br/>Then, he could say "I hope you use this axe to kill the mangy orc that ate my daughter".<br/><br/>Thoughts?                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lee_Short" title="Lee_Short"><img alt="Lee_Short" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lee_Short">Lee_Short</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261766/#Comment_261766" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-12T23:14:43+00:00" title="March 12, 2010 11:14PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2010 11:17PM by Lee_Short.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite><br/><br/>What if character creation &amp; inn slumming were intrinsically interwoven?<br/></blockquote>\nThis.  <br/><br/>Or, as I recently posted elsewhere, here's how I prefer to start a sandbox: start all the PCs in the town that most of them grew up in. Ask each player about his character's family, one important NPC who is his friend, one who is his enemy, one threat to the town's safety, and one piece of information that his PC possesses that could be turned into a quest some time in the future. All this info is public information for all the players, and each PC is given a chance to comment on his relationship to each NPC introduced. That gaves youplenty of time to whip up an intro encounter to finish off the chargen session, and a good base on which to plan future adventures.<br/><br/>BTW, reading the West Marches accounts reminded me a great deal of a D&amp;D game I played in/helped run in the 80s.  There were a couple of big differences: (1) our game featured rotating GMs, and (2) every player was expected to have multiple active characters, and (3) there was a game pretty much every Friday at R's house, with whoever happened to show up.  This had a lot of resulting effects (among them that you did not necessarily return to safe harbor at the end of each session) but there were still a very large number of similarities with West Marches.  You picked up a "hanging" adventure whenever the right players showed up (plus or minus one or two), or just recalled the PCs if time was dragging out).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261768/#Comment_261768" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-12T23:56:11+00:00" title="March 12, 2010 11:56PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: tony dowler</cite>So I want to delve a little deeper here.

I think I'd find that attempt at a narrative justification more jarring and difficult to maintain.

I don't use things like a table of horrible fates for PCs who haven't left the dungeon on time, and I don't think there's usually too much discrepancy between thinking "we have to run from this encounter because we're out of game time" and "we have to run from this encounter because we've been adventuring for long enough to be low on every resource and too depleted to face this thing now".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261826/#Comment_261826" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-13T14:28:06+00:00" title="March 13, 2010  2:28PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tavis,<br/>Good point; you don't need to run out of oxygen when you can run out of spells.

You can say what it is (an inn!), or not, it doesn't matter.<br/>* In-character, they debate about where to go next, and choose one character to send away on a side quest (probably to fetch something they need, or deliver an important message).<br/>* During the debate, they're all allowed to establish facts and rumours about where they're going. For instance, I might just say, "Let's head East, friends, for I have heard a rumour of an ancient tomb in the desert over the hills." And another player could support me by adding to that, "Good plan, brother! For I have heard that the local nomads seek shelter in the oasis by that tomb, but cannot stop there for fear of it being haunted."<br/>* The adventurer who was selected to be sent away leaves the party, and his or her player becomes the GM for the session.<br/>* The details of their plan become the adventure, pure and simple. In this case, they'd be exploring an ancient tomb in order to make the oasis safe for the local nomads.<br/>* Rumours they suggest, or ask NPCs about, are subject to a roll, which determines whether the rumour is true or untrue, which gives the GM information about the adventure the players are not privy to. <br/><br/>I haven't playtested it, but I'd love to see a game that does this well (perhaps mine does, but I haven't had a chance to find out yet).<br/><br/>I also really, really dig Joe's simultaneous "inn/tavern scene" and character creation!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261875/#Comment_261875" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-14T03:22:18+00:00" title="March 14, 2010  3:22AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James Jeffers</cite>I am interested in hearing about what bad stuff does happen if you don't get out of the dungeon before time is up for the evening.<br/>If you've played like this, what motivates everyone to abide by this?

The GM's idea was to roll up some extra wandering monsters while we camped out in a room, to make the dungeon more dangerous, but I don't think he's used it that much. Mostly we have all wanted to get out of the dungeon before the evening is up because we probably won't have the exact same players at the next game. Who plays the cleric when his player doesn't show? So it's mostly just preference now, but maybe we'll start running into more monsters.<br/><br/>If getting out before the end of the evening is a big deal, the GM should make sure not to trap the PCs in the dungeon. If you just trap one PC, the others can just leave him behind, and maybe you see if he manages to get out later. But if the whole party gets trapped, you're gonna end up staying in that dungeon for a while.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262039/#Comment_262039" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-15T11:10:27+00:00" title="March 15, 2010 11:10AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One way to allow PCs to always escape is to make sure they can't be trapped if they stick to explored territory, and to make it clear very quickly that they are trapped when it occurs. Thus, at any point in the evening, the PCs either know they have a safe way out, or know they are trapped. If time is running short, and they gamble away their safe way out to explore new territory and then get trapped, if they can't get themselves out of the trap before the end of the session, then they are stuck.<br/><br/>Then, you can either declare them dead, or if you want possibility of rescue, trapped or captured. In that case, a different party will need to be assembled to rescue them, and once rescued, they will be effectively incapacitated. Then it doesn't matter if the next session has a different set of players. All PCs from the lost expedition will not be playable until they return to town.<br/><br/>Note that the dead or captured option then allows you to deal with a random encounter that is unable to be completed before the end of the session. Though it may be advisable to make it possible to exit the dungeon quickly with a minimum of random encounters.<br/><br/>If one adapts this play style for a "mega-dungeon" the dungeon will have to be set up with express routes in and out of the lower levels, or allow upper levels to be cleared, perhaps allowing some random encounters, but even then, if you want to say let the PCs get down to level 20 or something large like that, you can't be having one encounter per level on the way in and out and allow much time on level 20 to get anything done.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers" title="James Jeffers"><img alt="James Jeffers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers">James Jeffers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262054/#Comment_262054" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-15T12:07:23+00:00" title="March 15, 2010 12:07PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, Frank, how do you know when an area becomes "explored"?

You could require the entire level to be cleared out. You could require that most of the set encountetrs are cleared out. If your random encounter table is based on occupants, you could remove each random encounter possibility when that group's primary lair is cleared out (thus producing "no encounter" random encounters as the table gets cleared).<br/><br/>One could also decide that once PCs are say 3 levels higher than a particular dungeon level that dungeon level becomes totally safe for them.<br/><br/>The key is to come up with some scheme that allows enough dungeon levels to be skipped that the PCs can get down to the lower depths without wasting too much of a session. There's something too to be said for a method that allows the players to trade off between mopping up a level in a perhaps boring and not very rewarding slog and allowing for some risk of an encounter on a level they are just traveling through.<br/><br/>There also may need to be consideration for parties of differing overall strength. If you have a variable play group, sometimes a small group may want to play it safer, sometimes the play group may not include the highest level PCs. Also, if players end up having multiple PCs (which would at least happen with the "rescue" scenario - in fact, such a scenario would make players want back up PCs), sometimes they will want to run their lower level PCs (a good strategy may be to have several PCs spread out in level). If this is the case, then you can't set it up so they must clear out the upper levels before proceeding to the deeper levels because then there won't be safe adventuring for lower level PCs (this all is based on the assumption that deeper levels are tailored to higher level PCs). In this case, providing some express routes may be the best option or the "higher level PCs are safe on the upper levels" option.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262149">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262149/#Comment_262149" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-15T19:49:56+00:00" title="March 15, 2010  7:49PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another option that can work is to provide some safe houses in the deeper levels of the dungeon.

D&amp;D style equipment is really rather boring in how implicit, unwritten and random any correspondence between your equipment and the challenges facing your character are. I've been handling this by making equipment nearly entirely freeform: just let the players list whatever stuff they expect to find useful and make some ability checks or whatever later on to find out retroactively whether the character was smart enough to pack something he needs. I don't really see the benefit in having the characters encounter a situation where a ten-foot pole would really have been useful; either the characters can make such a pole once the players figure out that they need one, or the challenge is pretty stupid, as the players know what they need only when they've already left the shopping part of the game. Should they have just bought one of everything on the list, or what?<br/><br/>It's one thing to say that you'll need to pack silver weapons when you expect to go against a werewolf; usually the character equipping thing in D&amp;D is not nearly so clear and puzzle-like, instead devolving into strange calculations about how many flasks of oil a character can carry comfortably or buy with his wealth. What I mean here might be phrased compactly by noting that the clearly most important type of equipment in D&amp;D is the sort that makes you overall more powerful, not any particular specialized tools you might want to take with you to an expedition. The GM is not going to penalize you for forgetting to write "torches" on your character sheet (or if he is, hey, apparently the adventure doesn't happen, as the character can't see anything in the dungeon without that light source); the part in the inventory that actually matters consists of your weapons and armor, which are rather no-brainer choices all-around, and surely isn't something you need to customize based on the expected adventure.<br/><br/>I'd like to see a fantasy adventure game with a cleaned out equipment list, one where only meaningful and significant equipment were included. The game would also involve usable and elegant encumbrance, information gathering and problem-solving aspects so that you could actually equip your character based on the challenges ahead. D&amp;D is in my experience not it, as the great majority of challenges reduce into rolling THAC0 against armor class; the rest of your inventory outside weapons and armor doesn't really play a role in resolving that sort of conflict. It works well enough when I GM it myself and make sure that character equipping only comes up as much as is necessary for the goals of the game; it'd be nice if there was some written game text for this sort of thing, too.<br/><br/>The above is all a longwinded way of saying that I don't care to spend time on equipment purchases or tracking encumbrance. I don't even care to track money when it is not part of the challenge environment; characters are just "poor" or "rich" to different degrees, and the GM tells you if you have so little money that a bargaining check is needed at this juncture.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262596/#Comment_262596" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-17T16:22:12+00:00" title="March 17, 2010  4:22PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with that.

Burning Wheel has an interesting level of detail on equipment. It has a few items that one would consider a bit odd (shoes? I have to buy shoes separately?), but I think they help set a tone (not everyone automatically has shoes - a lot of peasants must be barefoot, or at least are wearing very primitive footwear). Choosing weapons and armor makes sense (though if the armor choice really isn't, why not at least trim the list down). If dungeon exploring is part of the game, it may make sense to have a small list of items, but then the system needs to make your selection relevant. It is best to avoid the equipment list having too many "bad choices" on it.<br/><br/>I have often put an "adventurer's pack" on the equipment list. That provides things like sacks, rope, spikes, mallet, and a couple other minor goodies.<br/><br/>Tracking food, torches/lantern oil, and such may or may not be reasonable depending on how the game is run.<br/><br/>If the game has more than a one page price sheet, I start to question if it is too detailed. Sometimes it makes sense. The system I played in college had a long weapons list, but that was because each strength break-point had a weapon (or weapon/shield) of each type for it. This was instead of strength giving a damage bonus and worked well. I also had a booklet of magic items that could be purchased (though I probably could have distilled it into a page to be used at low levels, a page to be used at medium levels, and a page to be used at high levels, with the full booklet for anyone who was looking for something special purpose). My RuneQuest price list runs several pages, but the weapons have all the game detail and a couple pages are the skill training charts. The non-weapon prices fit on one page or so (and there are price lists for rural, urban, and barbarian - so the actual price list is only 20-30 items or so).<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
