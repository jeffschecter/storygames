A busy one, too. I was totally beat by the time I got home (in the rain!) and collapsed into bed early this morning.<br/><br/>Dangers &amp; Dragons was fun and simple -- a great way to kick off the con. Have to fix something on that Cleric sheet, though. Grr. I wouldn't mind so much if I hadn't gotten them laminated....<br/><br/>Friday night I did nothing, which was probably a good idea. Actually, I frantically thought about and prepared for the game I ran Saturday, but I didn't play anything.<br/><br/>Saturday morning was Hamish's awesome Dungeon World game, which made me feel much more comfortable with (and eager for) the DW game I was set to run the next morning. I played the bard and loved it.<br/><br/>That afternoon's playtest of By The Gods! went well, if I use "well" to mean "well for a playtest," in that it pointed out some pretty serious flaws in the game. I fixed it late that night in about 30 minutes, but for that playtest, we were kinda stuck with what I had, unfortunately. I found it very frustrating. My players were nice and patient; I thank them for it.<br/><br/>Saturday night was Hollowpoint, which I was very eager to play, but didn't go as well as I'd hoped. We had a pretty serious disconnect between the premise, which says we're all hyper-competent bad-asses, and the system, which says we're all fairly competent in one or two areas and rather hopeless at everything else. Really curious to take a closer look at the book.<br/><br/>Sunday morning was my Dungeon World game. I ran the old AD&amp;D module Dwellers of the Forbidden City using DW, and it worked a treat. I really had a great time -- it was probably my favorite game of the con, which feels very self-serving, but seriously, it was fun and satisfying.<br/><br/>After that was Lady Silver Age Avengers Bird, which I'd been anticipating for weeks, and it did not disappoint. I was Captain America and a total XP whore. When I played Andy's last LB hack, Operation: Blackbird, I was pretty conservative with the tags and the XP, but since then I guess I lost my shame.<br/><br/>Sunday night was Colin's Bulldogs! game, which I had to stick around for, because, y'know, FATE. Well, Colin and FATE. Fantastic group of players, too, but we set ourselves in conflict early on and thereby threw a huge monkey wrench into the whole session. <br/><br/>That ended an hour early, so I was all set to hit the road early too, but I went up to BarCon for a few minutes to say hi and ended up staying there an hour or more. Hamish and Colin have an insane idea for Dungeon World at the next con, and I'm just as insanely enthusiastic about it. It'll be a lot to figure out, but if we can pull it off, it'll be awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mattastic" title="mattastic"><img alt="mattastic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/ldwgS.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mattastic">mattastic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341672/#Comment_341672" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-05T19:45:03+00:00" title="September  5, 2011  7:45PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike_Olson</cite>After that was Lady Silver Age Avengers Bird, which I'd been anticipating for weeks, and it did not disappoint.

As long as you can work every tag into your action -- "I run forward with my <b>shield</b> held before me, <b>smashing</b> guys aside and <b>blocking</b> their shots, then <b>throw </b>it so it hits one guy, <b>trips</b> another, then <b>boomerangs</b> back to my hand -- it's all very <b>iconic</b>!" -- your description's going to be fun just by default, which is the whole point. <br/><br/>And use up that personal pool. Getting those dice back, especially in that particular hack, is dead easy. But again, that's okay, because it encourages players to act in-genre.

Players managed to get captured, escape and then take on and kill a pirate king. Best part of that game was in the battle with the pirates the sniper player takes out the pirate king. Right after another pirate declares he is the new king and puts on the pirate kings hat. The sniper then takes him out, too. No other pirates put on the hat.<br/><br/>Mountain Witch with Colin was awesome. Got to play it out as I was the first one to betray the group but in the end being the only one to complete the mission which was a great twist the surprised me playing the character if that makes any sense.<br/><br/>Played Hollowpoint in the evening with Mike and I agree with a lot of what he said. Characters are suppose to be super-competent Jason Statham types but you can't really succeed at anything without team work and you have a good chance at dying if you go solo. Also, the ultra-violence is all in the narration as the second half of our game had almost no violence. The game reminds me a lot of Leverage.<br/><br/>Next morning was Trail of Cthulhu which was fun but felt railroady. I also don't think I really like Cthulhu roleplaying because sanity checks just seam ridiculous to me. However, there was a great back story, interesting characters and setup (characters were mostly crew from Deadliest Catch) and fun roleplaying which made the game.<br/><br/>Last game was my Jaws of the Six Serpents game which is the second time I've had a con game crash and burn around me. I had made characters goals in conflict with each other which I thought would make for some fun roleplaying but ended up being the center of the game. PDQ doesn't really support that type of play and the game quickly fell apart. Some good discussion after revealed that the game would have been better under Smallville and some tweaks to the characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341742/#Comment_341742" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-06T11:34:38+00:00" title="September  6, 2011 11:34AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gateway was great.<br/><br/>I ran my first ever Friday 2pm game.  I think it will likely be my last 2pm Friday game.  I found it a bit stressful to have arrive at the hotel earlier than I have in the past (I usually get there around 4 or 5) and then roll immediately into running a game.  The game in particular was Dreadful Secrets of Candlewick Manor.  The game was okay and better than the first time I ran it back at the last con.  It has a high learning curve especially if you're using the Instant Mysteries technique like I do.  Also, in both games I've run the children have solved the problem in rather dubious manor.  In the first game the children mind controlled the head master and were perfectly content to leave themselves in charge of the school.  In THIS game the kids robbed a bank to solve the financial problems of Dr. Candlewick.  I'm not exactly sure what feature of the game or my GMing (or my player base?) leads to this kind of conclusion.<br/><br/>At 8pm Friday I played in Colin's Apocalypse Word game.  This was the first time I've played AW.  I was The Hocus named Spider.  Lots of dangling ropes, chains and straps imagery.  One of my favorite moments was when I described how the followers I have chained to me climb up a series of ropes and pull me up into a rope woven thrown.  In the end I ended up dying but not before I ripped out the throat (with my teeth) of one of my followers who had gone completely psychotic and spoke to her ghost in the psychic maelstrom.<br/><br/>At 9am on Saturday I played in Chris's Airship Pirates game.  This game reminded me of the difficulties of gaming with kids.  One player was rather young maybe in his early teens, maybe younger.  He was VERY enthusiastic.  He LOVED his character (a clockwork engineer) and was brimming with all kinds of ideas.  Unfortunately, the ideas were very unfocused and not particularly useful to the situation at hand.  I watched as poor Chris worked SO HARD not to stomp on this kids enthusiasm while trying to maintain some kind of credibility and relevance to the situation at hand.  I would not have wanted to be in his shoes.<br/><br/>At 2pm on Saturday I played in Colin's Mountain Witch game.  What an interesting game that is.  It's basically an encounter based quest game but with this technique that makes everything personal and relevant to the Samurai involved.  My character ended up dying when tried to kill another Samurai whose soul was being eaten by ghost.  I ended up impaled on his blade instead since he was willfully giving himself over to the ghost.  This whole game was a lot darker and creepier than I expected and at time bordered on full fledged horror movie.  Particularly the moment when Chris's character got dragged into a cave by whole bunch of cat-women things.<br/><br/>At 8pm on Saturday I played in the Houses of the Blooded LARP.  Jesus.  So hard to describe without charts and diagrams.  The player who I started a Romance with last convention returned along with her real life boyfriend/in game brother.  So I was delighted to see them again.  They were playing up a sibling feud having to with disapproving of my Romance.  So I conspired to have the brother murdered and was successful.... along with apparently a whole LOT of other people.  At the mid-point there was what I can only describe as muti-car pileup of murder.  The scene involved two failed assassination attempts, followed by my hired assassin being injured before my Romance murdered her own brother only to have one of the previous assassins return and murder her.  It was pretty epic.  Later in the evening the brother was replaced by a Tulpa (kind of zombie copy) so we could use his votes for the political stuff going on and my Romance was haunting me as a specter and together we identified her murderer.<br/><br/>At 9am on Sunday I slept in.<br/><br/>At 2pm on Sunday I ran Dead of Night for the first time.  This game is great and does everything I have ever wanted out of a horror RPG.  I made pre-gen characters for this one, a priest, a teacher, a drug addicted satanic cultist and his underage girlfriend.  The scenario involved Angels coming down from heaven to destroy the city.  The highlight moment for me was when I pointed at the player playing the cultist's girlfriend and said, "That's when you start to go into labor."  And Denys who was playing the cultist was like, "Ha Ha..... wait are you serious?"  Me: "Yes."  The look on his face was priceless.  The turning moment in the scenario was great as well.  This was just after I described one of the angels snuffing out the life of the babies in the maternity ward (yes, I went there).  The Priest snapped and walked up to the angel demanded its weapon.  He succeeded in his roll and so the Angel presumed he wished to join "the battle."  So the priest took the sword, and then cut the angels head off with it.  It was great.<br/><br/>At 8pm on Sunday I ran Don't Rest Your Head with just two players James, and Hamish.  This game was short but great.  James was a drug mule whose handlers had just threatened his sister and Hamish was a down on his luck musician who had just been attacked by his drum kit.  The game kind of resembled a more surreal dream-world version of PsiRun.  The characters were constantly fighting and running from surreal metaphorical manifestation of their fears.  This ultimately led to a confrontation with a nightmare I invented called The Dream Eater that eats the hopes and dreams of people.  I described the nightmare as a cross between Jabba the Hut and Truman Copote.

At the last convention, a few months ago, they demanded the same thing of me for a <i>Sorcerer &amp; Sword</i> game. That game turned out to be a blast, so I was more than willing to oblige again. <br/><br/>"But," I said, "I've really been looking forward to running a Heortling campaign in Glorantha using <i>HeroQuest 2</i>."<br/><br/>"Okay," Colin said. "That'll do."<br/><br/>Morgan was also there, and made it clear that someone would die if he wasn't in this game. (I had locked the <i>Sorcerer &amp; Sword</i> game to two players last time around.) So, he jumped in. And everyone wanted our friend Eric to play as well -- though he wasn't at the convention at all.<br/><br/>So, I left a convention for a second time in a row with plans to play a long term game with folks after the convention wrapped. I came home and <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=explorer&amp;chrome=true&amp;srcid=0B7Yp4b2m8nJyM2Q2MmI0OGEtYjJhNi00MzAwLWIwOWEtOGI4MmY4MTQwMDQ1&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">and cobbled together an Introduction to Glorantha Handout</a> for everyone and sent it out this morning. We're starting the campaign next Tuesday.<br/><br/>I don't know if this happens for other people, but I like the fact the con has become a launching point for games to follow up the intensity of play over the weekend.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel" title="Anarchangel"><img alt="Anarchangel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/333/nG33DU7UK4MTS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel">Anarchangel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341797/#Comment_341797" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-06T21:45:35+00:00" title="September  6, 2011  9:45PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To quote myself for a second, CK:\n<blockquote><cite>Me:</cite>The sign of a great con for me is always that by the end of it, I want to play more games with the people I've just spent a weekend gaming with.</blockquote>\nWhich is to say, I agree.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341798/#Comment_341798" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-06T21:48:08+00:00" title="September  6, 2011  9:48PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah.

Then Barcon.<br/><br/>Saturday: An interesting ShadowFATE game based on Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, The Running Man, and The Matrix. I played Snow White and fed a white phosphorous grenade to a Dragon. By The Gods was fun with some rough patches, though I got to be both Pantherine and have Thews so a Sword &amp; Sorcery game win in my book. Then Hollowpoint which I would definitely try again, but it had a strange disconnect what I think is supposed to be the source fiction, the only way to really win was to not team up so you could team up to take out the bad guys as a team. Pann's and now the Cherry Pie for the weekend was also a great tradition that must continue.<br/><br/>Sunday: Ran my FATE Torg Nile Empire game which was honestly a little too fight and action sequence heavy, but I hadn't run it before and so my pacing problems lead me to fall back on what I hope were some fun action sequences. I got all the visuals and scenes that I wanted to be in the game along with some great ones supplied by the players. And my fix for treating Torg Cosms and World Laws as compels worked great, especially with Vernon's character's ability to use his Reality skill to totally break the Pulp tone and keep it working in the game was a very cool emergent element that worked much better than I would have suspected. Played in Lady Silver Age Avengers Bird and kept myself and NoClue rolling in Experience Points by playing the Wasp to his Ant Man. The evening Fiasco: Bookhounds of London game was terrific and I'd also like to thank all the other players CK already mentioned and Christopher himself for making it my best game of the con. This is becoming a bit of a trend with Sunday night Fiasco games that I hope will continue. Although the game went in some very strange directions, the playset is wonderfully evocative and the addition of the Mythos to Fiasco really makes any Aftermath result into something horrific. I ended up rolling a 13 and I am still shuddering a bit at the "Awesome" ending that earned my character.<br/><br/>Monday: I ran my Retro-RPG 1st Edition Shadowrun FATE game and had a great time reveling in the color, tropes, and all around awesome of a totally Pink Mohawk 80s dark cyber future with magic. Again I feel like the pacing was a bit off, but I still had a great time thanks to some great players who were totally willing to join in the nostalgia and take a trip into the Shadowrun game of my fevered teenage imagination.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Olson" title="Mike_Olson"><img alt="Mike_Olson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Olson">Mike_Olson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341804/#Comment_341804" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-06T23:53:06+00:00" title="September  6, 2011 11:53PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: mcellis</cite>By The Gods was fun with some rough patches, though I got to be both Pantherine and have Thews so a Sword &amp; Sorcery game win in my book. </blockquote>\nYou are too kind.

I brought my 9 year old son along and we played some great games together.<br/><br/>Saturday morning we played the John Carter of Mars game the Tom Cummings was running using Savage Worlds. It was a good game, though I felt like we were statted a bit low - it felt like failed skill checks happened too often to keep the pulpy heroic feel up. But the game was engaging and my son got to hit things a lot, so all went well.<br/><br/>We didn't find any good young'n friendly choices on Saturday afternoon, so we played some board games. Ranyn really enjoyed Bang! even though he was the first person taken out. Which is good, because I already own a copy from years ago that I hadn't unwrapped yet. And we played a demo/playtest game called Kings of Air and Steam which is a resource/demand/rail route type game that was a lot more fun than I was expecting it to be. Look for that one when it comes out next year. It was a blast to play even with an ugly playtest version. It should be even better when it's pretty.<br/><br/>On Sunday morning we played in the Trail of Cthulhu game with Chris and Denys. I didn't really like the sanity mechanic - either lose some sanity to improve your chances of making the roll, or lose more sanity if you miss the roll (and worst of all, lose even more if you spent some but still miss the roll). Denys was already unhinged by the time we got through the prologue flashback. And it felt more like the GM was telling us a story rather than like I was actively doing anything. The clue discovery mechanics felt more like a way for the GM to have another reason to tell us the story he'd already written up then a way for us to have agency. But it may have been the GM not using the Gumshoe system well. I don't know the system well enough to know. But the premise was fun, which helped a lot. Denys even got to attack a giant Cthulhu monster using a boat, which was pretty great (and one of the few scenes that didn't fell scripted).<br/><br/>On Sunday afternoon, we played Jem: License to Kill. This game was absolutely excellent. I would have slightly preferred playing it with Savage Worlds rather than GURPS - the extra crunch that GURPS brings didn't add anything to the game (except that my son, playing a sniper, got to roll 9 dice of damage while everyone else was rolling 2, which made his day). But the premise was absolutely awesome - Jem and the Holograms are actually super badass CIA agents fighting KGB spies and such. One of the girls at the table was wearing a Jem t-shirt and Jem-style eye makeup, which was awesome. The game was a perfect one-shot con game gonzo humor/action romp. We had clear goals - first infiltrate a compound and then do a concert where we help a person defect - but tons of freedom about how to accomplish them. There were great little twists in the story that, while obvious for that sort of story, felt like we were staying true to genre tropes rather than being hackneyed.<br/><br/>Apparently this was the GM's first time running games at cons. I think his name was Warren "Mook" Wilson. (Denys and Chris - he played the archeology professor in the Deadliest Catch Cthulhu game.) As I said, he did an EXCELLENT job running the game. I'm tempted to track him down and buy him a copy of Savage Worlds - he said all he's ever run is GURPS.<br/><br/>Attending with my son was a little limiting at times - I didn't play in any Fiasco games, which I'm dying to try, and I didn't make it up to the BarCon suite for a drink. But overall it was a fun change having someone to share my whole con experience with. And seeing him play new games for the first time is always a blast - he picks up a lot of things really well. He had a good time and is looking forward to going again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cczernia" title="cczernia"><img alt="cczernia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://zerneeak.com/avatar_mini.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cczernia">cczernia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341877/#Comment_341877" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-07T17:17:12+00:00" title="September  7, 2011  5:17PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 7, 2011 5:17PM by cczernia.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Anarchangel</cite><br/>I want to play in that sequel, Chris!<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Conan</span>Darmid must have vengeance!</blockquote>\nI don't think I want to run it though it does sound cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341878">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cczernia" title="cczernia"><img alt="cczernia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://zerneeak.com/avatar_mini.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cczernia">cczernia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341878/#Comment_341878" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-07T17:20:45+00:00" title="September  7, 2011  5:20PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite><br/>"But," I said, "I've really been looking forward to running a Heortling campaign in Glorantha using<i>HeroQuest 2</i>."<br/><br/>So, I left a convention for a second time in a row with plans to play a long term game with folks after the convention wrapped.

I didn't really like the sanity mechanic - either lose some sanity to improve your chances of making the roll, or lose more sanity if you miss the roll (and worst of all, lose even more if you spent some but still miss the roll). Denys was already unhinged by the time we got through the prologue flashback. And it felt more like the GM was telling us a story rather than like I was actively doing anything. The clue discovery mechanics felt more like a way for the GM to have another reason to tell us the story he'd already written up then a way for us to have agency. But it may have been the GM not using the Gumshoe system well. I don't know the system well enough to know. But the premise was fun, which helped a lot. Denys even got to attack a giant Cthulhu monster using a boat, which was pretty great (and one of the few scenes that didn't fell scripted).<br/><br/></blockquote>\nGreat way of putting it.  I chatted with Will (the sheriff) after the game and we basically came to the same conclusions you did.  Lots of wasted opportunity here.  The game was fun because the players made it so.<br/><br/>Also, good to know about the Jem GM.  I don't know him but will look for his games in the future.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341914/#Comment_341914" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-08T00:30:00+00:00" title="September  8, 2011 12:30AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 8, 2011 12:31AM by noclue.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I also had a great time at the con.<br/><br/>Started things off by running my cyberpunk <i>Smallville</i> scenario at 2pm Friday. The game was booted from my preferred slot and I didn't expect it to fill on Friday afternoon, especially when only two people had signed up by 1:58pm. I was all set to join Jesse's <i>Candlewick </i>game when the game not only filled, but with one extra. So, I shifted into GM mode and we had a great time. They ended up turning on their yakuza employer and killing him in a sword fight, so all's right with the world. The group included only one person who had read the game and some people who had no idea what they were in for. There were two 14-year-olds, a girl and boy, who had only played a little D&amp;D and had not been to a con before. The boy was pretty introverted, but he seemed to be aware of his own shyness, for which he received a bit of gentle chiding from his friend. Still, I think he had fun after I dragged him into things. I girl played the sentient AI in the setup and I realized that I need an early opening scene with that character to make sure that the AI gets into the action. She did a great job and through in a lot of helping rolls, but I should have given her a bit more spotlight time. From everyone's reaction, the game seemed to be a success.<br/><br/>Friday at 8PM was Colin's <i>Apocalypse World</i> game with Jesse, Andrew and Camoainh (I still can't spell that name). I love AW with a deep and soulful love. The game rocked. I particularly enjoyed when my battlebabe, Beastie, walked through a pitched gun battle, stark naked with a shotgun in one hand and dragging a spiked ball and chain behind her in the other. I also liked her toying with Andrew's Chopper's affections and whipping him into a jealous killing spree. Battlebabes are fun. <br/><br/>Saturday morning I slept in. So, my first game of the day was Colin's <i>The Mountain Witch</i> game, which was another fantastic time. It was my second time playing the game and I love how it slowly builds up a head of steam and ends in a climax of blood and betrayal, very much like a samurai film. My character Hideo had been dishonored when he was found skimming off the rice collection to feed his family. His dark fate was a past allegiance, which turned out to be the daughter of my sword master, who had become pregnant with my child and was killed by her father when she wouldn't reveal that the child was mine. Her ghost showed up looking for a body, which led to possession and ultimately my cutting Jesse's character in half for trying to stop her by cutting me down. Favorite moment for me was when the famished ronin started eying my faltering horse hungrily, Hideo quietly drove the horse off a ravine to preserve party unity and avoid bloodshed.<br/><br/>Saturday night was the<i> Houses of the Blooded</i> Larp which was tons of fun. It took me a while to get into things, but when Jesse asked me to kill his lover's brother on the hunt, things got completely crazy. We had worked out that the sister was actually going to kill the brother, but when things started two other assassins joined in. One going for the sister and the other for the brother. Once things sorted, we worked out a nice little scene that left me wounded, the brother dead by his sister's hand and her killed by one of the assassins. <br/><br/>Sunday morning I ran a new <i>Mouse Guard </i>scenario which I posted about <a href="http://www.burningwheel.org/forum/showthread.php?11264-[MG]-The-Shipment" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The game was completely full with two alts, but when 9AM rolled around only two players were there. Still, it was a blast and they had great fun fighting to keep their boat afloat in a raging storm and fighting an angry badger.<br/><br/>Sunday at 2pm I played in the <i>Lady Silverage Avengers Bird</i>, which is a silver age supers hack of <i>Lady Blackbird</i>. I played Giant Man/Ant Man and really enjoyed the way it emulated the silver age comic feel. Bantering with Morgan's Wasp character, who kept getting into danger, "Damnit Janet!" Mike's portrayal of the self righteous Cap'n America was also fun. I thought the opening of the scenario needed a little tweaking to get it to sing right out the gate the way that Lady Blackbird does, but a good time was had by all.<br/><br/>At 8PM I played in Jesse's <i>Don't Rest Your Head</i> game with Hamish. Jesse brought the surreal crazy that DRYH needs and Hamish and I had a great time seeing what weird shit was going to happen next. A horde of cannibal nurses trying to serve me up some of my sick mother was just the start of the wacky. Jesse also wisely ended the game when our energy started flagging.<br/><br/>Sunday morning I had an IaWA game scheduled, but only two players signed up, which would have been difficult even if I had all of my brain cells intact. Luckily, they were willing to shift into Hamish's Dungeon World game. My halfling thief, Perkins Steadybottom, was a blast. He killed two lizard men on the way in spectacular fashion, and then managed to steal the Magic Sword we were seeking while everyone was busy killing the Medusa. However, my luck deserted me when I rolled to find an escape route and led me straight into the Troll we had left outside the magic walls. Now my sword rests somewhere in the swamp where the fell beast knocked it, and I am dragging the heavy dead body of Cadeus the black elf, looking for a resurrection spell so I can revive him and go back for it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Denys" title="Denys"><img alt="Denys" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j128/iannoble/elf-pic.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Denys">Denys</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341958/#Comment_341958" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-08T12:42:04+00:00" title="September  8, 2011 12:42PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            James -- I totally flubbed on you running a In a Wicked Age.

Except that would probably be better.<br/><br/>But I can't get over how awesome the hair and makeup and clothes are. Seriously. Probably the best costume design that's ever been done on any show ever. I've watched about 30 hours of the show now, and I still get excited when, every few episodes, someone changes their hair or their face markings or their outfit, because so often what they do next is totally outlandish and awesome.<br/><br/>And the amazing thing is, they pretty much never mention it. There's this subtext going on. The sub-groups within the tribe using matching markings to each other. And they change as the groups change - like Jack and Dal start marking like each other and differently from Amber, when Dal used to mark the same as Amber before. It's this whole neat thing that goes on, but they never address it directly, at least not so far in the 60 episodes I've watched out of the 250ish. They just do it, and the viewer can notice it, but they don't talk about it. I love that.<br/><br/>Too often the plot is predicated on the kids just doing stupid selfish stuff over and over and over. They could have used some better writers to make it more awesome. But most of the actors are solid, especially considering that they're all so young (not 21 Jumpstreet fake-young, they're really young. Like Jack's voice totally changes between Season 1 and 2, even though it's supposed to be the same day, so he's about 12 or 13. And Patsy, who is a bit younger, has a growth spurt and is suddenly like 6 inches taller than Chloe, who she was pretty much the same height as the season before.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
