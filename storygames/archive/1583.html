                    I watched Casablanca again last weekend.  And the more I think on it, the more it grows on me as a basic situational model - every character has something that someone else needs or wants - from love to travelling papers to whatever; many characters have things that multiple others want or need.  All of them are under pressure and chase their needs, using what they have to bargain after a fashion...<br/><br/>...And that's it.  That's the whole thing.<br/><br/>Your thoughts?                </div>

                            Well, except Peter Lorre, who strikes me as more of a MacGuffin-granting machine than a character, as such.  I mean "somehow, just because you despise me, you are the only one I trust." is a good line, but I can't imagine that guy ever thinking it...<br/><br/>And so, I guess, the only point of "disagreement" I might have w/you is that Casablanca does reach for something to move everyone in its web into motion, something to ensure that stuff actually gets resolved out of this situation.  I think it's distinctly possible to imagine the situation just turning into a nasty small and tragic one that does nothing much for the status quo without Lorre.  And that Lorre's character being the only one who acts in a potentially character-violating way is an important part of getting that, to my mind.  Hence a quibble with "every character." <br/><br/>If I'm actually making an argument here, or even disagreeing with you at all, it's only to emphasize that even a situation and set of relationships as well-crafted and understood as Casablanca's still requires careful attention to finding some one thing that's gonna stress that web and make stuff jump.<br/><br/>The neat part for me about your post was its provoking me to reflect on the way that other prods to the sitation could have easily resulted in a number of different, and significantly less "resolved" outcomes to the story.  This reminded me of the need to pay attention to what that necessary thing is.<br/><br/>Also maybe this is relevant to the concern expressed about Bangs as disguised illusionism stuff from a bit ago, though I don't wanna stake a lot on my comprehension of those discussions.                        </div>

                            I think it's an awfully good set up for a small scale larp one-shot. Hell, almost a classic.                        </div>

                            Levi, I think you made a very succinct analysis of that great movie.  I'm not intending to drift the topic, but the basis of the film noir game I've been working on is that every character has needs and wants, but also something they fear or are hiding.  And often characters will commit increasingly despicable crimes to hide their "secret" from other people.  Film noir tends to have more desperation and guilt as character motivation than Casablanca, and all of that typically explodes and causes a character's downfall in noir.  But your point about the root motivations basically being a spider's web and not at all linear in nature are very interesting.<br/>
<br/>
To JBPlatt's point about finding one things that will stress the web; having one thing as a direct or indirect connection to everyone in the story can be a powerful motivator.  It may be a crime, a MacGuffin or $50,000 in heist money.  Sam Spade may not necessary care about the Maltese Falcon (to use another Bogie movie), but he certainly cares about who killed his partner and why all of these people are falling all over each other to get it.<br/>
<br/>
And yeah, Peter Lorre is such a great creepy character!!<br/>

                            It's sad, but the "You have, I need" thing is making me think of Zelda and those side-quests involving long chains of item trades.<br/><br/>I guess that's uninteresting because 1) none of the characters take action on their own--they just wait around until someone comes by with what they need and 2) the wants and needs resolve into a straightforward chain with no interesting choices.                        </div>

Which means, basically, that those are things to avoid in such a scenario.<br/><br/>Good to know.                        </div>

                            And the advantage of a situation design, or a one-shot LARP over a CRPG is that you can manage both branching the the need-chain, mutli-purpose haves, and clever resolutions to needs.  CRPGs choke on the first two (c.f. the brilliant but incredibly buggy Fallout) and are completely incapable of the latter.                        </div>

                            The other side of the want/need conundrum I often find important to stress in game design is the, "I want/need you NOT to have what YOU want/need."  (Having played in many LARPs where all I needed to do as a character was to be granted something.  Alas for persuasion.  Well, not really.  More amusement because I waited until the granter was exhausted...)                        </div>
