If they bring it on their own, fine.  If the game text or rules help people know how to bring it, great.  This doesn't change whether you have a GM or not, whether the GM's role rotates or not.  In <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>, where the GM is constant, Vincent still tells them GM how to bring the conflict, because even if the GM is used to bringing the conflict in other games, the way GM's are supposed to bring the conflict in <i>Dogs</i> is somewhat different.<br/><br/>In a rotating GM game about conflict, the players that will be responsible for bringing the conflict need to bring the conflict (this could be all of them or just a few of them, since not every scene has to be about conflict).  If they can do this on their own, because they already know how to bring the kind of conflict the game requires, great.  But having rules and other texts that helps them is probably a good idea too.<br/><br/>Yeah?

I'm doing something sorta like it in <i>Geiger Counter</i>, but it's based on movies where not all the characters are in the same location or scene at the same time, so players generally frame scenes that involve characters other than their own.  So when my character is in a scene getting chased by zombies, someone else -- whose character isn't in the scene -- frames it and plays the zombies.  That kind of thing can definitely work.<br/><br/>If you want all the characters to be in the same scene at the same time... you really might need someone external (like a GM) to bring the conflict.  Otherwise you bump into that Czege Principle problem where a player is creating and potentially resolving opposition to their own character, which is no fun.  PTA has involved players (those whose character is in the scene) frame scenes, but it still has an external Producer (a modified GM role) to bring the conflict.<br/><br/>EDIT: Jake, he's talking about the GM changing scene-to-scene, not session-to-session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_112991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112991/#Comment_112991" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-08T11:30:33+00:00" title="December  8, 2007 11:30AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 8, 2007 11:35AM by Ry.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>If "The PCs are a party that works together against external challenges" is the baseline of play, why do you want to use a rotating GM?

Well it seems to me that the only problems you are likely to have with conflict (in the context of rotating GMs) will derive from lack of continuity in story as GMs pass the hat.  Eliminate that continuity and it's not an issue.  That may well not be the kind of game you expect to play, of course.<br/><br/>We also have a rule that the current GM's character is never involved in the the scenario he runs.

You're not going to change your culture of play by changing the rules. Speaking from experience, when you are using by-scen (or faster) rotating GM rules and there's still a culture of "entertain me" what happens is that one guy (usually the guy who organizes other things ... looking at you) gets appointed the unofficial GM and the game falls flat because no one else contributes, the de facto GM isn't empowered to contribute.<br/><br/>What I'd do is:<br/>1) Rotate GM by scenario.<br/>2) Use a game where the GMing load is light. I'm thinking particularly of Moldvay D&amp;D here, which has a very nice little random dungeon generator. Scenario generation tools are going to be totally key here. The goal is to have the generation be able to happen either in ten minutes after everyone shows up but before play starts or during play itself.<br/><br/>To let you know how much I've been thinking about this lately: I'm working on a game right now with exactly this sort of structure. It's about ninjas.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113189/#Comment_113189" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-09T19:13:52+00:00" title="December  9, 2007  7:13PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Or you can build it into the rules somehow. For instance, if you're using something like TSoY's Keys, or some sort of "relationship" mechanic, each GM can designate three NPCs as "anchors". At the end of the scene or session, for every Key or relationship that a player takes to one of those "anchors", that GM gets a point.<br/><br/>If you're playing D&amp;D with no additional rules, some kind of rule like "1 point scored per hit point lost by a PC while you are the GM" matched with a rule like "lose 100 points if a PC dies while you're the GM" could be devised. <br/><br/>If your group would be up for a competitive game where each GM's scene or session or adventure is somehow "rated" in interest or challenge level by the players, and GMs compete to score the most points by the end of the month, I could see that being fun.<br/><br/>I would look for what sort of conflict and adventure you guys like and attach a reward mechanism to it. If you can find a ay to reward it indirectly, you could have some interesting stuff going on at the table. For instance, in E6, I think you have "Confidence" points or "Determination points" or something like that ,right? What if a GM scored a point (or XPs, or whatever) each time a player spent one of those points during their tenure as GM?<br/><br/>I'm sure none of these examples would work too well, but I'm sure something like that could be devised.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_113195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ronaldo" title="Ronaldo"><img alt="Ronaldo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ronaldo">Ronaldo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113195/#Comment_113195" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-09T21:07:27+00:00" title="December  9, 2007  9:07PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think if the scenario/background is well-established and comfortable ("familiar?") to the players and the characters are motivated, it is likely to be easier for the players to contribute to the plot and generate conflict.<br/><br/>My GMless games take elements of Universalis and PTA. <br/><br/>From those games, all the players outline the adventure together. From PTA, the PCs are created at the "same time" and their creation spawn numerous potential NPCs and stories. <br/><br/>I would just make sure, everyone has a good idea of the game's world and of the other player's characters. This has been an easier way for me to take the weight of my back of having to provide the entertainment every week.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113239/#Comment_113239" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-10T06:34:33+00:00" title="December 10, 2007  6:34AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm... would it be OK to re-start this thread, stating what's the issue and put the title as "Diagnose my situation" ?

At the very least reading the rules and trying it will give you a different perspective on scene-by-scene rotation.<br/><br/>That said, Polaris does have a tendency to splinter into separate stories, and there is a notion that one character is the hero in any given scene, while the other characters tend to take supporting roles. In lots of DnD you get more of a dynamic that scene by scene each PC contributes roughly equally to events (especially in combat). In Polaris you can either try to fight back against the tendency to fragment, or you can go with it, abandoning the notion of unity of stories entirely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
