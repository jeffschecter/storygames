ZP manages to talk about a video game without showing even a single screenshot of it (normally) and so in the same way I can talk about a tabletop game without showing gamers sitting around a table. While ZPs are reviews, whereas Project Y is introductions to replays, I figured the same approach would work, be bright, be loud, be fast. <br/><br/>Oh, and be English <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414672/#Comment_414672" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-24T04:54:59+00:00" title="May 24, 2013  4:54AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks guys!

I can see the utility of the FFG appproach, but I reckon a video for Sci-Fi Beta Kappa should focus on the players having fun organising a mission, rather than the rules; in fact, I'm tempted not to mention the rules at all. Since posting this thread I've talked to some other people and the advice is very mixed, but what everyone seems to agree on is the need for the video to in some way reflect the tone and playstyle of the game. Also, a Brit game designer I spoke to at UK Games Expo advised me to wait until the full artwork version is ready, so that's what I'll probably do.  \n<blockquote>Well, they're not for my games, but as part of Project Y I'm creating short animated movies introducing each game and replay (heavily influenced by <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation" rel="nofollow">Zero Punctuation</a>).</blockquote>\nWell, good luck with Project Y dude (I'm assuming it's not a front for developing atom bombs that you will then proceed to toss on some unsuspecting southern Japanese cities?), but, having checked out the site, I reckon if I had a review of one of my games on Zero Punctuation my sales would be likely to fall through the floor.

Board game demos- due to their being mainly about the rules- can be incredibly boring, and CCG videos are more or less just players slapping cards down on the table. However, in RPGs, players are acting out roles, and how they do that, especially in SGs, is very important to get across. Of course this is less the case with more traditional combat-based games, because realistically not much mileage can be got out of scenes with player after player going 'Ok, so that's STR 6, -1 for encumbrance, +2 for night vision; er, no wait...' etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
