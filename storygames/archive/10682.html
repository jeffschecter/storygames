Overwhelming opposition which forces the heroes to stick to the shadows, distract guards, steal keys, etc. until they can rescue the prisoner, take the artifact, plant a false document, or something like that?<br/><br/>I would hate to do it as a long skill challenge, because that ends up feeling like, regardless of how the players role-play the situation, it still comes down to a handful of dice rolls. I also would hate to have a situation where failure means you go right back into the combat grind (fighting your way out sounds cool, but in reality isn't that cool).<br/><br/>Any thoughts, suggestions?<br/><br/>ME                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236978/#Comment_236978" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-12T07:14:27+00:00" title="October 12, 2009  7:14AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Take away their dice and their character sheets, tell them that if they get discovered things will get really really ugly and then roleplay it.<br/><br/>Ok, that's probably too radical.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236980/#Comment_236980" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-12T07:54:41+00:00" title="October 12, 2009  7:54AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like Thief the CRPG.

If you don't want to do what Teataine said, I'd do something like this:<br/><br/>-- one stealth roll for the whole group<br/>-- choose the lowest stealth skill in the party, and use that<br/>-- use passive perception for the baddies, except possibly any alert guard types<br/>-- guards get one roll for the whole group, just like the PCs<br/>-- use mods for distance and circumstances way beyond a paltry +2/-2<br/>-- the actual roll is made with a "d20" gotten by rolling 10 fudge dice and adding the result to 10                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_237007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237007/#Comment_237007" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-12T10:34:09+00:00" title="October 12, 2009 10:34AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 12, 2009 10:35AM by Ludanto.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, don't disregard Skill Challenges.

Each time they must face threat of discovery, not being discovered should make a meaningful, postiive difference to the outcome/situation.  Failure bringing down unfaceable opposition, if they have no route to escape, that is a problem.  It's better if failure has a different outcome, such as the goal of the adventure is locked down, moved, etc.  They bundle their captive on a horse and flee.<br/><br/>Other ideas, take advantage of fact that combat is in 6 second rounds.  Encounter with minion guards, take them out quickly or they raise alarm.<br/><br/>Have them face hazards and traps, guard animals, other threats that don't include "someone who raises alarm".  The first accomplishment is to learn of this route, the secret passage that the controllers of place don't like even most of their followers knowing about, or that is too dangerous ("no one dares the deep passages") etc.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_237040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237040/#Comment_237040" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-12T13:38:48+00:00" title="October 12, 2009  1:38PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: merb101</cite>.

It worked pretty well.<br/><br/>If it's a sneak-then-fight scenario you want, where, say, the entire party wants to get at the boss without dealing with the lieutenants and soldiers, you could allow the entire party to use different means to enter the objective -- the grinning faceman delivers himself to the dungeon with the weekly fruit shipment; the thief sneaks in through the sewers, the bard seduces the dungeon keeper and gets easy access to the sensitive bits (but without their armor, of course.)  <br/><br/>Characters who fail miss the rendezvous, or must pay healing surges to make the rendezvous. If someone misses the rendezvous, you can add a rescue subplot to the boss-confrontation encounter.  If everyone misses it ... have the baddie ransom the characters or something.  I'd do this as a single skill check for each character, rather than use a skill challenge.<br/><br/>If it's a theft or a plant mission that doesn't require the whole party, allow the option of party splitting.  Some characters will go on site and make the checks for the mission.  Others can roll Aid Another to represent preparing the battleground, causing distractions elsewhere, whatever.  If you are splitting the party, use skill checks rather than a full challenge, or if you want a challenge then have something for the others to do and interweave the two scenes.<br/><br/>For a full-on skill challenge about dungeon intrusion, think of the dungeon in terms of obstacles, rather than rooms and hallways and 5' squares.  Your obstacles could be the Goblin City Ruins, the Diamond Mine, the Dark Temple, the Warforged Foundry, the Slime/Pudding Breeding Pits, the New Dawn Sword School, etc, etc.<br/><br/>Come up with a variety of obstacles, rewarding different skills -- though if you've got a player who really gets off on being a great intruder, pander to their skill set a bit more than the others.  I put each obstacle on an index card, noting the base DC and any special rules, and throw that card right on the table so everyone can see it.  <b>Make sure your obstacles are rich and interesting enough to inspire solutions and creative skill use from the players.</b>  Put some effort into describing them, or at the least give them very evocative names.  <b>It's my experiences that skill challenges go sawdusty unless the players' imaginations are provoked.</b><br/><br/>My overland skill challenge dealt out the obstacles randomly.  If the party had good intelligence going in, you might deal out two obstacles at once and let them pick one.  I also had a backtracking option where the party could draw a new obstacle, but they had to roll a saving throw or accrue a challenge failure.<br/><br/>(sudden thought) For something a little more structured, uou could also lay out the obstacles in tiers, with the characters having to pass any single obstacle on each tier to win the challenge.  In a three-tier storming-the-wizard-castle scenario, the first tier would be the walls, gatehouse, sewer, and fruit truck; the second might be the courtyard, the barracks, the cisterns, the scullery. The third might be the tower itself.  You might not have a choice of obstacles on the final tier. I haven't thought much about this tiered obstacles idea, but it probably doesn't fit the 3-failure skill challenge paradigm that well.  Failure here probably means backtracking with maybe the odd you're-discovered-game-over crisis.<br/><br/>In my overland skill challenge, I had random draws for weather and encounters on each obstacle.  This helped to fight the degenerate roll-roll-roll skill challenge feel with some interesting distractions or opportunities.  In the dungeon, you could lay some excellent treasure out in plain sight to tempt the thief, our have them find beloved NPCs in prison cells.  Hated enemies might be found asleep or otherwise vulnerable.  Romance-loving bards or bravura warlords might blunder into a face-to-face with a curious and available member of the preferred sex--someone who knows the shortcut to the nerve center of the place.  Challenge their priorities at every turn!  Add both risk and reward so that it's tempting for the characters to engage the distraction.  There's nothing better than making a party argue during a stealthy intrusion!  <br/><br/>(edited to add: but not every encounter should be a distraction.  Put some encounters in there that's germane to the challenge, too, so goal-focused players can be rewarded for engaging them.  In my overland thing, the party blundered into a convocation of storm spirits who were celebrating Kord's birthday.  Some of the party took some time out of their schedule to dance with the spirits, and they danced well and appropriately, so the spirits rewarded them with a free pass through the current obstacle.  They got to ride the lightning in the nice way.  The best dancer also scored a one-time +2d6 damage boon on his lightning axe, too.  This was the first encounter that came up in the challenge so I was gratified when they engaged it, but alas, I've got a tell or something, because they bypassed all the interesting distractions I had lined up...)<br/><br/>Yes, stealthy situations really don't work well with a full party.  This feels appropriate.  If you've got an obstacle that can be stealthed, use a group skill check.  You can lower the DC somewhat so that Magus McClumsy doesn't hose the whole enterprise singlehandedly.<br/><br/>Physical confrontations within the challenge can be abstracted.  If one obstacle is a single guard standing smoking a pipe and the characters decide to kill him silently, you can say he's a minion and have them roll a to-hit vs. his defenses.  A miss might charge a healing surge on top of the challenge failure, as the noisy minion is chased down and silenced.  Some non-combat risks, like tightrope walking across the spider breeding pit, can cost healing surges on failure.  Others, like swimming a leprosium's sewers, might charge healing surges regardless of the check outcome.<br/><br/>Healing surge charges are much more interesting when you use them in a scenario where the party must fight at the end of all the sneaking.  Similarly, you can grant bonuses to obstacle checks for appropriate daily power use.  Let the ranger sweat out whether they ought to use her Split The Tree to shoot a pair of ropes across a chasm just so that Magus McClumsy can get across...<br/><br/>You can tie interesting things to a single skill check failure.  I occasionally like to throw a crisis/opportunity in: on a failed roll, the players can try to circumvent the obstacle again using a different skill.  If they succeed, they are +1 success, +0 failures for that obstacle; if they fail, they are +0 successes, +2 failures on that obstacle.  You can roll into instant-fail situations where a failed skill check makes the party eat a challenge failure, plus they must pass a different skill check or lose the whole challenge immediately.<br/><br/>After a check failure, you may require the players attempt the same obstacle again or you may deal out a new obstacle.<br/><br/>After every obstacle check, pass or fail, challenge the roller to provide narration.  Reward reincorporation by other players with circumstances bonuses.  This can fight the roll-roll-roll thing.<br/><br/>At three failures, time has run out, or so many hornets have been stirred up that the objective is impossible or very difficult.  The fallout from that can be combat or a new challenge to escape.<br/><br/>Man, I need to send my overland challenge to Dungeon magazine...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_237138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237138/#Comment_237138" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-13T06:43:20+00:00" title="October 13, 2009  6:43AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let the players knows how many opponents they face beforehand (too many) and have some kind of time contraint so they can't take extended rests. They can fight the guard patrols and win but sooner or later they will run out of healing surges and powers they will need to fight the collossal treasure guardian. Make each stretch a puzzle, you might be able to pass the first part of the dungeon just sneaking in the shadows (skill challange or just some rolls) but after that the main halls are torch lit and swimming through the sewer (underwater grate puzzles) or climbing on the walls above the guard patrols (when someone falls the rest of the party will volunteer to jump just to land on the heads of the guards below) and finally there is a web of minion sentries watching each other and you have to shoot the unwatched sentries so you can sneak past their posts. Some of these stretches can be completed using invisibility magic but the last one before the treasure chamber is guarded by blind beasts with a keen sense of smell, masking your smell in creative ways and avoiding places with draft that carry your scent will take you through it without fighting.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe treasure guardian sleeps but the floor tiles have numbers on them. Stepping on them in the right sequence (fibonacci?) will let you pass but the wrong ones make loud sounds to wake the guardian. Athletics or acrobatics checks will let you jump over tiles since some will be marked as safe if you're unsure about the following ones.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237203/#Comment_237203" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-13T12:19:05+00:00" title="October 13, 2009 12:19PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite>If the party had good intelligence going in, you might deal out two obstacles at once and let them pick one. </blockquote>\nThat would be a good use of a secondary skill in a skill challenge, too: Normally, you'd have to pass through the (flip a card) Haunted Woods, requiring Arcana or Religion checks to keep the evil spirits at bay as you pass.  But you aren't trained in either skill, so you roll a Nature check (a secondary skill that doesn't give successes for the challenge) to draw another card, which gives you an alternate route over the Cliffs of Ice, requiring Athletics or Endurance.
