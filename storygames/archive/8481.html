It's the vanguard RPG of the "kill the GM and take his stuff" front, after all.<br/><br/>I'm probably going to be proven wrong in several ways, but at first blush, per your definition of fiat, I think it's fiat-free. Saying Yes is hard-coded into the GM's role at the table, which IMO is the secret sauce to making it fiat-free. The GM is also constrained to outcomes of rolls in a couple mechanical ways: dice don't hit the table 'til everyone agrees to outcomes, and outcomes are absolutely unbreakably binding once the dice hit the table.<br/><br/>Also, per your definition of "game" (which I agree with), the real kick in the pants is this: Don't Be A Dick. It's a rule! I believe it's actually printed in BE, but it's also an overriding, absolutely do-not-break rule in BW play culture. So if not being a dick is a rule, the only way the GM can do dickish things (i.e. fiat that touches the bathing suit area) is by breaking the rules. <br/><br/>In short, BW is built around the GM following the same rules as the players, with the addition of special GM-only rules that give him the practical flexibility to administer the game. But there is explicitly no version of "rule zero" (where "rule zero" = the GM is above the rules) anywhere in the game text, or in the game culture.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_187835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187835/#Comment_187835" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-12T14:59:25+00:00" title="January 12, 2009  2:59PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The following is not a knock on BW, just a thought that popped into my head, as I tried to figure out what Filip counts as "fiat."<br/>\n<br/>\nMy (quite possibly imperfect) recollection is that the question of whether a skill can be used as a Field-Of-Related-Knowledge on a given roll is answered yes or no by the reliable and solid method of "Ask the GM, and he'll make a judgment call."<br/>\n<br/>\nI am interested to hear whether Filip counts that as the sort of "fiat" he's discussing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_187836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187836/#Comment_187836" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-12T15:01:18+00:00" title="January 12, 2009  3:01PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            simply giving someone the authority to make a decision does not Fiat make.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance any game where decisions are made by consensus and if consensus cannot be reached identifies who the buck stops with is not a Fiat game.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance any game where certain individuals are given the authority to make a decision but there are procedures in place for what other players can do to overturn or alter that decision if they don't like it is not a Fiat game.<br/>\n<br/>\nRemoving Fiat from a game does not require pushing all decisions back to some rules tree or random table.

Few are the games that don't give players Fiat power over what their character is thinking at any given moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nFiatless games include:  Dirty Secrets and Universalis specifically because there is nothing anyone can do in those game that can't be "appealed" or "challenged" thereby triggering a rules subsystem to resolve the disagreement.<br/>\n<br/>\nMist Robed Gate might be another, but I can't remember the rules specifically enough to know whether the lack of fiat was imbedded in the text or just our we happened to play it.<br/>\n<br/>\nPolaris I think is a good example...at least a very fiat minimal game.  The moons may have some limited fiat power but in the main interaction between Heart and Mistake there's nothing either can say that the other can't respond to by using another of the key phrases.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul:  That definition isn't mine, its what fiat means.  Its a pretty clear, easy to understand word, actually.  The U.S. for instance uses Fiat Money...Money which has value and must be accepted as legal tender for no other reason than the government declared it to be so.  The lightning bolt came from the heavens and killed my character for no other reason than the gm declared it to be so.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost people parent their children via fiat.  I think its this experience that gives us a natural bias against it.  Games dominated by GM fiat have essentially established a parent / child type of relationship that can be quite grating.  But in any discussion regarding using fiat in RPGs we should not limit ourselves to that historically common model of useage.  I bet we could come up with several examples of games with substantial player fiat powers as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_187850">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187850/#Comment_187850" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-12T15:27:58+00:00" title="January 12, 2009  3:27PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since going down the "what the hell is fiat anyway?" path seems inevitable, has anyone ever agreed to a jargon division between:<br><br>* Discretionary authority explicitly granted to a player<br><br>and<br><br>* Discretionary authority not explicitly granted to a player, but used anyway<br><br>?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_187859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187859/#Comment_187859" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-12T15:41:50+00:00" title="January 12, 2009  3:41PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>That definition isn't mine, its what fiat means.

I guess such games must be very resillient to players who'd rather design their own, then, providing an already complete package the hacking of which wouldn't be very time efficient. I wonder what lessons are there for tabletop rather than virtual story games?</blockquote>I don't think anyone could call computer RPGs non-resilient to their player base.  When a single game can satisfy tens of millions of people, then the computer role playing game designers are doing something right. I think one satisfying aspect is, just as you are looking for, the removal of bias on the part of a GM or role play director.  Unless someone cheated and hacked the game as you mention everyone who plays it can only attain game defined accomplishments by actually doing them.  In regards to what we face-to-face role play simulation gamers can learn from them is just how powerful (and lucrative) well defined and unbiased achievement in gaming is.  Everyone wants to win at games no matter their type, but the value of a good role playing game appears to be more in accomplishing the role playing under the least biased judgment versus attempting to accomplish non-role playing objectives like storytelling.  It's the same in non-role playing games as in your example of Chess.  The most popular play style there is to achieve the traditional objective of the game versus using the pieces to tell an interesting story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188244/#Comment_188244" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-14T08:46:43+00:00" title="January 14, 2009  8:46AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's an exercise.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou're playing D&amp;D;, you're in a dungeon.  In the course of the description of the hallway the DM mentions a door on the right.  You go to that door.  The DM says "It doesn't open".  You say "I pick the lock".  The DM says "It's not pickable".  The M-U says "I cast 'Knock'".  The DM says "it doesn't work".<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can all agree that this is the DM exericising fiat to declare that this particular door at this particular time cannot be opened, yes?<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, you're playing some computer RPG, you're in a dungeon.  You noticed a door nicely rendered to your right.  You go to that door.  You hit the "open door" key.  It doesn't opened.  You pull up your skill list and select "Use Locking Picking".  Nothing happens.  You pull up your inventory list and double click your Open Doors scroll.  Nothing happens.  Now, if nothing happened because there was some random chance to open the door and you failed that's one thing.  But if nothing happened because that "door" was just a rendered graphic and there is actually no coded door even there and nothing coded on the other side, its just decoration that is completely non functioning...is that not effectively fiat?<br/>\n<br/>\nJust as the DM decided, and had the authority to enforce, that no you could not open this door; so to did some programmer / programming team decide (and had the authority to enforce) that you could not open this door.  The fact that they made that decision 1000 miles away and months or years of development time ago seems not to matter one whit.  The decision in any PC game as to what crates can be moved, what chests can be opened, what chairs can be sat in, what windows you can break, what walls you can climb, what trees you can chop down...and what of all those things you can't is fiat.  It was a decision made "and that's the way it is".<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might say "that sucks, I should totally be allowd to bypass the guards at the door by going around back and climbing in through the window".  In the computer game you can't do that because the window around back isn't coded to be functional.  In the table top game you can't do that because the DM will come with a never ending string of excuses to prevent it.  In both cases its because some Plot Master has decided that you can't get into that building until you complete a quest so the guards will let you in, period.  In both cases that decision is being enforced by fiat.  Fiat on the spot by a live DM or fiat by programming is irrelevant, the effect is exactly the same.<br/>\n<br/>\nPC games are far far fuller of fiat than even the most railroaded table top game ever has been...at least until we get to petabytes of memory space and processing power...<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease.  This thread continues to ramble around in circles because Filip chose to call this select list of things he's looking to avoid "fiat".  It would have been infinitely better if the thread title was "Help me think of a game that has these properties".  As it is there's just a whole bunch of unnecessary back and forth going on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188260">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188260/#Comment_188260" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-14T10:04:59+00:00" title="January 14, 2009 10:04AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>ow, if nothing happened because there was some random chance to open the door and you failed that's one thing.

I think that distinction is a key to what you're talking about that's getting lost in the wrangling over fiat -- because it makes no difference to the concept of whether fiat was exercised, but it apparently does make a difference to the concept of fribble-frabble.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188340/#Comment_188340" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-14T14:47:18+00:00" title="January 14, 2009  2:47PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 14, 2009 2:48PM by GB_Steve.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bunnybunny</cite><strong>Steve,</strong><br><br>If there are NPCs in the game, how does the GM decide what they do without resorting to any kind of fiat.</br></br></blockquote>\nIt's the same as with players and their characters.

You've chosen to play a game, you've chosen to decide to accept everything that's in the package.  The package says:  "...and then the GM decides what happens using any means or rubrics he feels like at the time"<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you get to that part of play and the GM does exactly that...is that fribble frabble...or because it was specified in the package to do it that way are you fine with that?<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm guessing that you're not fine with it...because if you were than any game with a Rule 0 would meet your needs.
