So say Marla is trying to ask Brandon out. A failure could mean that she asks, and he says he's busy that weekend. So, failure, but not particularly painful, right? I mean, maybe it was hard to work up the courage, and sure she's disappointed, but it's pretty mild. She's not even shot down EXACTLY; there's still hope that next time he'll say yes.<br/><br/>Instead, a failure could mean Brandon laughs in her face, recovers, sees her hurt look, goes "Oh, you were SERIOUS? I, um--that is--" and then bursts out laughing again. Marla just stuck her neck out, and had her hopes fucking CRUSHED.<br/><br/>Or another angle: Marla's trying to work up the courage to ask, but just as she's catching Brandon's attention, he gets a phone call, and has to dash. Weak, yeah? She failed to ask, but so what? So instead, just as she walks up to grab his attention while he's talking with his buddies, she hears him say "Marla? That skank from Felony Flats? No way I'd hit that, man; she'll probably give ya the clap." Ouch!<br/><br/>And like Jeff says, stick plenty of underclass stuff in there. Basically view these characters as people unsheltered by the legal, financial and social safety net that middle-class white people enjoy, and without the opportunities available to same. Make sure you bake this into the setup, not just the conflict results: If Marla and her mom work as maids in the posh country club where Brandon's a member? Your "painfully unsuccessful" failure is practically written for you.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304068/#Comment_304068" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-12T12:35:59+00:00" title="December 12, 2010 12:35PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is great stuff.

It's kind of what Must is going through right now in our AW game - he might get to save the world, but is the Family going to be around to apppreciate it?<br/><br/>One thing that makes me a little cautious about the essay though is that, while I agree that outcomes where the protagonist just flat out doesn't get what they're striving for are sometimes narratively unsatisfying, I think for fun play you always need that option to be on the table. You need for it to be a real possibility that Must won't save the world, for the struggle to be worth anything at all.<br/><br/>To make this relevant to Nicotine Girls (which I'd love to play with you some time, btw.) how do you strike that balance between painful outcomes that force the character to compromise or sacrifice for what they want, and painful outcomes which flat-out deny the character their goal? How, as GM, do you make that call? I don't think that's something you want to leave up to discression. NG is the kind of game where you need to be able to play as hard as the rules will let you.
