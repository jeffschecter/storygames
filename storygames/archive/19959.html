Basically, they needed a bit of new blood in it, and I could do with some creative exercise. The campaign is set in a heavily D&amp;Dified 15th century Prussia.<br/><br/>Everything went wrong when I saw the train toys my brother got for his boy as a Christmas present.<br/><br/>My character, he/she/it is a conscious steam locomotive (think Thomas the Tank Engine) created 400 years ago in a Byzantine workshop, intended for mining work. As a Large creature Iron Thomas (as it is known in Prussian lands) cannot fit in the smallest of dungeon corridors, and it is obviously very slow in untracked terrain, but what it lacks in means (say arms, feet, equipment slots in general), it makes up in spirit.<br/><br/>Infernal spirit, to be exact: Thomas is a 1st level Warlock of the <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/church-of-the-broken-god-hub" rel="nofollow">Broken God</a>, found whispering at night about his "Creator". It does not speak, yet communicates telepathically with anybody within 30 feet. Thomas spits flaming coals to 15 feet straight ahead, scalds whomever he pleases within 10 feet with boiling water and Charms the minds of weaker men; his chief mechanic, Renfield, speaks for him where human interaction is required. His top speed on rails is over 200 feet per round, and obviously no one would survive a direct hit. Thomas mends minor equipment by eating it and spitting it whole out of its internal forge.<br/><br/>Thomas, however, has certain serious weaknesses aside from an inability to wield a weapon or fit through a door: it cannot move over soft ground unaided, its top speed without rails is at best 10 feet per round, iron rails cost something like 30 gp per five feet, and wooden rails (5 gp a square) can only be used for the most delicate purposes. It goes without saying that while Thomas can, indeed, consume coal and drink water independently, he cannot build rail or perform basic maintenance. Standing up, should he topple over, would presumably take many agonizing hours for this eldritch abomination.<br/><br/>In the past centuries Thomas used to work hard ferrying barges up the Danube river. As the first session opens, Thomas is found in slavery to a Jewish money-lender in Danzig, unable to maintain its accustomed style (coal, water, occupation, etc.) independently in the tumultous world of Reformation Germany. The influential owner sends Thomas out as a support vehicle for adventurers hired to secure an abandoned castle and transport any movable valuables (furniture, etc.) back to Danzig.<br/><br/>In practice I spent the first session managing a rail-building operation from Danzig to the adventuring location 15 miles away. Meanwhile, the adventuring party went ahead to pack the castle up and make sure everything was ready for transportation back to Danzig. I should get to location only 3-4 days after the adventurers, which surely will easily suffice for the packing, assuming they don't get their fool asses killed by the land pirates or whatever lurking in the castle. Quite hilarious.<br/><br/>A few long-term goals:<br/><b>*</b> Thomas wants to get out of serfdom and become an independent locomotive. For this he needs loyal support personnel, an useful rail network (in a world with nothing of the sort, to be clear) and a steady source of coal (burning wood makes me weak!).<br/><b>*</b> If Thomas should achieve a fortune of say 100,000 gp at some point, he'd likely start dreaming of a Carpathian Rail deep into Hungary, as somewhere in there lies the Scholomance Technicum (the vocational technical branch of the infamous Scholomance, you know) where others of his kind may yet toil in servitude.<br/><b>*</b> Give me a paddlewheel and I shall rule the waves! The campaign is supposedly set in the Baltic theater, implying seafaring derring-do. Good luck with that, little locomotive!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441368/#Comment_441368" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-12T20:49:44+00:00" title="January 12, 2015  8:49PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh my.<br/><br/>This made my day, Eero!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441371/#Comment_441371" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-12T21:26:04+00:00" title="January 12, 2015  9:26PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 12, 2015 9:26PM by Adam_Dray.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is amazing and really weird.

(The GM'll mix the new brew out of original material and old TSR modules, I understand.)<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned, I am playing in the main game, it's just that I have a character with a very peculiar role and perspective that might at times make splitting the party a good move. I've found over the late years that I apparently have an almost infinite appetite for the procedurally pure in D&amp;D, as well as ample patience for irony; the combination basically means that I needed to do something rather weird to entice my own curiousity for playing 5th ed D&amp;D. If the above character spec reads like an unique snowflake, that might not be entirely accidental.<br/><br/>Considering the practicalities, I figure that the low levels are the toughest. Besides the obvious advantages of money allowing me to hire ever more people to build track for me, there's also the fact that sooner or later I'll hit some sort of flight spells on the Warlock career track, at which point Thomas will certainly have "options", so to speak. As always, the D&amp;D GM will find it harder and harder to keep the campaign on rails as characters grow in power.<br/><br/>Ah, a high point in Thomas's railroad tycoon career: so as to discourage peasants pilfering his tracks with their sweet, sweet iron(y) content, the locomotive has set about developing a rumour campaign in the countryside. Apparently touching those tracks makes all your progeny come out albino forevermore. Nevertheless, I fully expect that Thomas will meet its end sooner or later by encountering a stolen track section at cruising speed.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, I do have a spare character in case Thomas bites it when it gets to the castle in a week or so. (Could also perish in random encounters on the way, although Thomas is egoistic and fearless about peasants trying to steal his tracks or whatever.) The spare's name is Marty McFly - he's a teenager 0th level Bard with an 80s attitude and his own car. He's also badly out of his own time, as one might imagine, but hey - <i>he's got a car, man!</i><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441376/#Comment_441376" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-12T22:18:14+00:00" title="January 12, 2015 10:18PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Clearly your entire approach to this campaign is a vicarious metaphor for the transition from "railroaded" Bad Roleplaying to Cool New School Off-Road Roleplaying.<br/><br/>If Story Games were playing this game with you, it would probably implode under the weight of unfortunate railroad-related puns.

Wouldn't be very nice to bear a grudge in secret <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>I definitely agree that Iron Thomas is a special snowflake character that takes a bit of playtime investment from the group. My hope is that it'll provide a bit of a strategic context for the game, though, and win grace through that - I happen to think that the current creative dynamic of the campaign is far too much at the teat-sucking end of the spectrum, it'll do it good to have some PCs with their own agendas. In this regard Thomas is not dissimilar to a PC who is also the secret crown prince, or other similar catalyst characters. Sort of like a combination of the token Klingon and the hidden prince, in fact, in that Thomas both carries its own campaign hook as well as existing largely outside the human social perspective.

It was a super lethal campaign so the character was short lived. I was relieved when the character died. I didn't complain because we were a very large group and I was very much a spotlight hog generally (I also had a snowflake character, a vampire made of porcelain) so I felt like kind of being in a glass house.<br/>\u2022 One archer who had dozens of pages of "secret backstory" but was very disconnected from the relationships and drama that was unfurling among the other players in actual play. His schtick was kind of a parody of MPD/DID with just non sequiteur "crazy" answers to everything we talked about, and then when monsters came snuck away (and secretly killed them with arrows).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441429/#Comment_441429" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-13T21:55:11+00:00" title="January 13, 2015  9:55PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 13, 2015 9:55PM by Paul_T.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would normally have major complaints about this character, too (and, as Sandra points, more so as a player than I would as a GM).<br/><br/>However, given that it`s Eero playing him, I wouldn't worry.

A few notes on the continuing adventures of Iron Thomas the loco motif:<br/><br/>The humanoid adventurers continued messing about with the Caldwell-look-alike castle, finding Polish bandits habitating the place, as well as many "sofas" that Thomas would have to lug back to Danzig later. Being heavily outnumbered, they didn't really make much progress; one of them is close to dying from some sort of disease contracted from a half-Cerberos. Thomas would have to hurry up in reaching them and helping out!<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the rail-building operation had its own problems: work was slow due to the low number of workers and the necessity to reuse rail (we only have about a kilometer of rail available). The distance to the castle from Danzig is roughly 20 kilometers, but fortunately there exists a level road to the target that Thomas is high-handedly exploiting in his routing.<br/><br/>Problems surfaced after a few days of work in the form of Livonians/goblins accosting the rail camp at night to steal our supplies. Iron Thomas stood relentless guard in the night, but unfortunately it only has eyes in the front, so goblins messing about in the train cars caught it with a bit of a surprise.<br/><br/>Thomas's boiler was powered down at the time, but I made my Athletics check to light up the firebox autonomously, and the goblins didn't notice it, so in 7 minutes or so Thomas would be ready to run over anybody foolish enough to stray onto his short section of rail. (15 minutes ordinarily, but we agreed that an excellent success allowed me to halve the bootup time.) Unfortunately our rail-building team had camped away from the locomotive, too far away for Thomas to support them effectively.<br/><br/>Thomas is telepathic up to 30 feet and has Intimidation trained, so my first move was to scare the goblins messing about near the train with visions of grinding gears falling futilely to cosmic entropy - this type of warlock telepathy doesn't require a mutually intelligible language, which I interpreted as allowing the communication of nightmarish visual concepts of the mechanomind.<br/><br/>Thomas also contacted the building crew and tried to get them to dash quietly to the relative safety of the train (in truth Thomas could do little while still booting up his boiler, yet perhaps it could scare the goblins), but unfortunately only Renfield made it; Bert died to the spears of the Livonians, and Tom was horribly injured.<br/><br/>As the goblins approached, Thomas actually intimidated them all with the combination of telepathy, intimidation skill and utter alieness to their life experience. The retreat of the goblins gave us time to gather Tom, and for Thomas to get the boiler up, allowing us to move about a bit and blow the whistle, scaring the goblins to leave us alone. There was talk of a theme song for the railroad (for the intimidation factor); the current lead candidate I understand is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WF4p9TxDcAs" rel="nofollow">the theme to Chuggington</a>.<br/><br/>Renfield had something of a pickle in his hands with Tom, whose injuries were severe. He tried his best to patch up the fair workhand and old friend. Iron Thomas was not very helpful, as its failure in medical skills indicated the misunderstanding of a key detail: Thomas's internal forge that it uses for the Mending cantrip could not, in fact, heal organic creatures (so far at least, although I suspect that the Warlock spell list doesn't give many options for conventional healing). Nevertheless, Thomas insisted that Renfield would have to carry the crushing guilt of Tom's slow death himself, as he refused to feed Tom to the forge despite the urgings of the soulless machine.<br/><br/>When the dawn finally came, Thomas ordered Renfield to dispose of the bodies as he would (Renfield opted to bury them), so as to make way for a new and better building crew. The nocturnal encounter impressed upon Thomas the importance of taking this northern, chill borderland seriously, for it was quite different to the sunny shores of the Danube where Thomas had spent such human generations in calm and patient toil during its backstory.<br/><br/>The new building crew is not the minimal workforce provided by Thomas's Dwarven/Jewish owner; rather, Thomas expends its own savings (warlocks get 4d4x10 gp to start, which came out to 1440 silver dinars in campaign currency) to hire local farmhands, with Renfield as its spokesman. Renfield succeeded in a few key Charisma checks at important moments, which ultimately resulted in only one day of delay on the building, while doubling the size of the workforce with workers who have no idea about the sentience of Thomas. (Not that they have much idea about what a locomotive is, anyway.)<br/><br/>A few words about "management by perdition", the management philosophy utilized by Thomas here: at first the workers are led to believe that Renfield is acting for a wealthy, generous, faraway Master who is something of an eccentric and inventor; little do they know of the dreams and fears that drive Renfield on. Unfortunately, the wealth and generosity is as illusory as is the ease of the work, that soon proves both dangerous and grueling as Renfield drives the hands on. However, they are held to this bondage by the twin shackles of fatalism and fear: stories of the train and the railroad spread in the countryside, and the rites the workers undergo to dare to touch the rails bind them to the railway in their own minds. They shall come to know that the train will catch them should they attempt escape; scald them with boiling water should they harbour resentment; any attempting open rebellion will be shot down immediately by Iron Thomas's Charm Person, and while the target will soon realize the enchantment (5th edition Charm only works for an hour), it will merely increase their fears, now amply realized.<br/><br/>(Why's Thomas being such a jerk? For the simple reason that it doesn't have much money, and the little needs to go quite a ways here. Fortunately the Old-Prussian country folk are dirt cheap to hire as workers, all things considered, but once the money inevitably dries up, other means of motivation should be in place.)<br/><br/>Renfield unfortunately failed to convince the new workers to sleep underneath the locomotive for added safety on the first night, what with their homes being just a couple of miles away from the work. We shall be working on their motivation later. Renfield, of course, sleeps in the locomotive cabin from now on - Thomas has no intent to lose its most valuable servant.<br/><br/>(If it starts to look like Thomas ruthlessly fed its Jewish handlers to the goblins, saving the weak-willed one to act as its voice among the humans, only to then start building up a workforce loyal to itself only... well, plans and accidental occurrences can be difficult to distinguish through the haze of time and distance.)<br/><br/>Next on the time-table is finishing the journey to the castle, where hopefully the adventurers have succeeded in securing the place so we can load up the furniture and start the return journey. It will unfortunately be slow going, as rail needs to be built (and collected) back as well, but Thomas hopes that its owner will see the sense in building permanent tracks for back-and-forth travel once he sees how handily Iron Thomas handles the current mission.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441720">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441720/#Comment_441720" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-19T22:24:03+00:00" title="January 19, 2015 10:24PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 19, 2015 10:26PM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<table><thead><tr><th><b>Session #\xa0\xa0\xa0</b></th><th><b>Finances\xa0\xa0\xa0</b></th><th><b>Work Force\xa0\xa0\xa0</b></th><th><b>Rail Built\xa0\xa0\xa0</b></th><th><b>Rail disassembled\xa0\xa0\xa0</b></th><th><b>Rail Total</b></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th>1</th><td>1440 dnr</td><td>2</td><td>12 km</td><th>11 km</th><th>1 km</th></tr><tr><th>2</th><td>1335 dnr</td><td>5</td><td>1 km</td><th>1 km</th><th>1 km</th></tr></tbody><tfoot><tr><td colspan="4">Distance remaining to the castle: <b>7 km</b></td></tr></tfoot></table> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441730/#Comment_441730" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-20T05:36:00+00:00" title="January 20, 2015  5:36AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wonderful, Eero. <br/><br/>But your fantastic tales of Thomas the Loco Motif leave me parched for more details about the actual game and the people playing it.

The former is just business as usual, really - if the GM tells us that he'd like to run 5th edition "as an old school game", then presumably this is sort of what it's going to look like.

(Which I've discouraged - I think it's fine and interesting for the human adventurers to act independently, while I simultaneously appreciate the GM's move in involving Thomas with the adventure in an amusing support role.)<br/><br/>I would not be surprised if the next adventure was of a nature that unifies the party more thoroughly. I pretty much ambushed the group with my character, too, so the GM didn't actually prep much for having to run the game for a train; the group actually knew that "Eero'll come in and play a locomotive unless you can find some other players to fill the table" a month in advance, but I imagine that they thought I was joking or something <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Regarding 5th edition, I suppose I should say that I like it - it has many virtues, and it compares favourably to both 3rd and 4th in many important modes of D&amp;D play. I'm not emotionally hooked myself, but that's mostly just because I'm not into prefab D&amp;D anymore (never was, thinking back), so as far as I'm concerned all the fiddling with the rulebooks and such is something of a crutch. 3rd-5th each wins over the others in their own best application, I think, but perhaps the 5th has the widest dominant swatch, and its application is the one most relevant to the creative mood of the scene right now - in that way a very timely game, I could see many Pathfinder players switching to this boat.<br/><br/>For gamist adventure play 5th is equal to 4th and 3rd, although they each are best for somewhat different types of play. For an old school adventure type sandbox game (which you might be asking about here) 5th is mediocre; better than 3rd-4th, about as good as 2nd, worse than actual old school systems. And that's with the obvious rules-hacks of course - you have to have xp for gold (or some other form of quest xp) to make a sandbox sing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442121/#Comment_442121" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-27T14:46:49+00:00" title="January 27, 2015  2:46PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 28, 2015 12:25AM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The third session with Iron Thomas was relatively uneventful: one of the humanoid adventurers had contracted a rotting disease from a half-cerberos in the last session, but some rather lucky dicing had him find a competent surgeon who amputated his arm to stop the daily saving throws and consequent inevitable decay of the form of flesh. The ailing adventurer requested Renfield to grant him a place to rest post-surgery; Iron Thomas was pleased by the temerity of the man, and released the funds to procure a bed for the transportation of a resting patient in his train.<br/><br/>Rail-building work proceeded without distraction, and Thomas released funding sufficient for Renfield to continue paying daily wages to the builders for the next week of work. Less book-keeping for me that way, let Renfield worry about the daily expenses.<br/><br/>Meanwhile the humanoid adventurers continued their interminable efforts at ousting the den of thieves from the castle Thomas is supposed to be emptying of furniture. I took a nap, but understand that while they managed to slay the ruinous devil dog, the siege continues. Considering the exhaustion of the adventurers, odds are that we'll see Thomas bring its iron rail to the problem directly in the next session.<br/>\xa0\n<table><thead><tr><th><b>Session #\xa0\xa0\xa0</b></th><th><b>Finances\xa0\xa0\xa0</b></th><th><b>Work Force\xa0\xa0\xa0</b></th><th><b>Rail Built\xa0\xa0\xa0</b></th><th><b>Rail disassembled\xa0\xa0\xa0</b></th><th><b>Rail Total</b></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th>1</th><td>1440 dnr</td><td>2</td><td>12 km</td><th>11 km</th><th>1 km</th></tr><tr><th>2</th><td>1335 dnr</td><td>5</td><td>1 km</td><th>1 km</th><th>1 km</th></tr><tr><th>3</th><td>1270 dnr</td><td>5</td><td>2 km</td><th>2 km</th><th>1 km</th></tr></tbody><tfoot><tr><td colspan="4">Distance remaining to the castle: <b>5 km</b></td></tr></tfoot></table> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442132/#Comment_442132" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-27T21:59:08+00:00" title="January 27, 2015  9:59PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very interesting, Eero!<br/><br/>What does Thomas plan to do when he arrives at the castle?

Thomas could then get up some speed from further away and crash onto any enemies unfortunate enough to have been lured into the foyer of the castle.<br/><br/>I personally expect that Thomas will have limited means of engaging the enemy, should they continue lurking within the keep like rats. It happens to be the case that the place has a double door wide enough for Thomas to enter the foyer, but surely the internals are full of narrow corridors and standard format doorways that won't fit Thomas's enormous width - it's something like 6-8 feet wide, I imagine, allowing traversing of 10 feet corridors, but not doorways or such.<br/><br/>I just checked, and apparently Enlarge/Reduce is a 2nd level Wizard/Sorcerer spell. Fortunately Thomas has its mysterious warlock benefactor with the custom expanded spell list - chances are that the "Broken God" will bestow the ability to shrink to half-width to Thomas if it ever makes it to 3rd level (when warlocks gain their 2nd level spells). That will improve Thomas's capabilities for operating inside puny humanoid architecture quite a bit. Of course it'll do little for the fact that the firebox of the locomotive will eat up oxygen from any enclosed space relatively quickly.<br/><br/>As a general policy Thomas expects that intimidation and selective use of Charm Person will enable it to encourage the pesky outlaws to vacate the premises. They are only human,after all, and therefore need everything from food to fresh water to survive. Meanwhile the iron being is a tireless guard upon the gate.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442154">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442154/#Comment_442154" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-28T00:38:38+00:00" title="January 28, 2015 12:38AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting!

Now, obviously you can play 5th edition in a more old-schooly way, I'm not disputing that; I'm merely observing that the game includes a lot of material that encourages different kinds of thinking.<br/><br/>Having "character builds" in D&amp;D implies several things:<br/><b>*</b> You design characters instead of generating them, which creates a sense of ownership and commitment, because the design process starts with thinking up an interesting idea you want to explore.<br/><b>*</b> Characters are unique and exceptional individuals, which implies yet more commitment to the individual character.<br/><b>*</b> Character creation takes time and effort, as per the above.<br/><b>*</b> Play is character-focused, as the individual characters get opportunities to show off their capabilities as well as fluff-related peculiarities.<br/><b>*</b> Character advancement is a central part of play, as that is how character builds flower.<br/><b>*</b> Character build play of this sort relies philosophically on a precise rulebook upon which specific builds rely. This undermines dynamic rulings and discovery through play.<br/><br/>This character build element penetrates to many levels of play. A simple example is how GMing hygiene is endangered with heroic unique snowflake characters: the pressure on the GM to not kill characters is immensely stronger in this environment than it is in a systemic environment designed for an agnostic referee-GM. Alternatively, the GM lets the chips fly as they may, which may be cause for player frustration at character death (while character death is fun in Paranoia or old school D&amp;D, it is not fun if you've put a lot of advance work into making just the kind of character you like).<br/><br/>Aside from the objective presence of a character build approach to the game, there is of course the cultural context. This is more of a problem in the heads of the players, but you have to play these games in real conditions, so it's not a non-issue, either. In our game this comes up in the form of creative discord, as half of the table plays towards an old school agenda, while another half plays towards a new school one. This is actively encouraged by the presence of modern, commercial D&amp;D books at the table - for some people they support certain habits of thought ingrained through the last 15 years of partaking in new school play. If it looks like new school D&amp;D, it is pretty easy to stick to playing it that way.<br/><br/>The third issue is skirmish combat focus. This, again, can be mitigated in various ways, but the basic observation is that while being more streamlined than 3rd or 4th edition, the 5th edition rules are still pretty strongly concerned with setpiece combats: the purpose of combat is not to bring about sharp choices and quick consequences in the midst of a general exploratory and strategic framework, but rather it is an opportunity to express character builds and roll dice. This can't help but influence the overall nature of the combat system.<br/><br/>Those are my main observations at this point. They are in no way insurmountable difficulties for a GM wanting to impose a refereed sandbox regime (a few pages of house rules takes care of that), but it is still fair to say that this falls much short of e.g. Basic or LotFP or Swords &amp; Wizardry or such actual old school D&amp;D variations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442717/#Comment_442717" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-09T19:33:01+00:00" title="February  9, 2015  7:33PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We didn't play last week due to a flu-ed in GM, but today was again a session. Unfortunately, it seems like the adventures of Iron Thomas have come to a conclusion of sorts:<br/><br/>In the last session one of the flesh-and-bone adventurers encountered a devil dog of some sort in the castle, and was poisoned by its vile disease before the party retreated. This time play was started with figuring out what would happen to the poisoned barbarian. He retreated back to Danzig to seek a doctor rather desperately, as the poison disease of the hell hound was not trivial to cure for a largely 1st-level party, and one character had already had an arm amputated to save them from the same ailment.<br/><br/>The barbarian found in Danzig to his accumulating amazement that there was little in the way of healing temples in the (15th century German) city, and the doctors were largely helpless when faced with the exotic disease; surviving it would require an arduous struggle lasting weeks and requiring some luck in dicing.<br/><br/>At this point the player's patience ran out: he'd joined the game to play a heroic fantasy adventure game in the spirit of 5th edition D&amp;D, not a mudshit (a term Finns have started using for a particularly historical, grim sort of low fantasy) game where a 4th level character he's worked on for months of real time dies to a paltry status effect. He crumpled his character sheet and dashed out, inviting the rest of the group to have fun without him.<br/><br/>So yeah, hardly ideal - I mentioned earlier about the agenda ambiguity in the campaign, and this was practically a schoolbook example of such: some players want to make character builds and dream fun tales about heroics, while others want to see drastic failures and earned successes. The GM belongs in the latter group despite the system choice, and while the game worked well enough as long as this particular player's character continued surviving (pretty much everybody else has had regular fatalities all along), the pain of a serious setback caused him to lose his composure altogether.<br/><br/>(Those who've read about my D&amp;D experiences over the years know what sort of D&amp;D I've been mostly interested in lately. This doesn't mean that I have anything but sympathy for ruined fun and frustration of this sort; I used to run a middle school D&amp;D game for the crew last year specifically because I wanted to give this player - among others - an opportunity to play some low-stakes D&amp;D in an environment increasingly dominated by old school precepts. Unfortunately they swapped into the 5th edition game last fall, and apparently haven't quite gotten on the same page about the creative fundamentals.)<br/><br/>Anyway, the rest of the session was spent in talking about future plans for the campaign; without the 4th level barbarian the party felt themselves outmatched by the adventure altogether, which forced a retreat, and made for a natural juncture to discuss the general progress of play. The GM had purchased the first three boxes of Mentzer D&amp;D just last week (he already has the Compendium) to further his studies of old school D&amp;D, so the discussion turned to switching rules systems in the hopes of finding a better psycho-social support for the old school ethos. We'll see what comes of it; I certainly support increasing cohesion and clarity of creative agenda, but I also think that it's a shame for the crew to abandon 5th edition like this - it's a fair mid-school (or maybe new-school) D&amp;D, and would deserve better than being a budding old school GM's chew toy <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>As for Iron Thomas, I believe that I'll retire it at this time, as Basic D&amp;D is definitely not about unique snowflake characters of its ilk. It fits the tone of the locomotive saga that Thomas was just about to finish making its way to the adventure location, but never quite got there - we're left guessing whether it would have proved useful in a 5th edition dungeon skirmish, or merely a massive pain in the ass <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442719/#Comment_442719" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-09T19:49:59+00:00" title="February  9, 2015  7:49PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting post, Eero, and I agree that an ending rife with uncertainty about the future suits Thomas just fine. <br/><br/>Not much to say, except to ask:<br/><br/>How was this disease thing handled in play?

The dog was a half-Cerberos sort of deal, with two heads. (Typical of the caliber of "humour" in this circle would be to note that the crossbreed of a proper three-headed Cerberos and an ordinary dog would, obviously, only have two heads.) As far as I know the dog and its nasty HP-reducing disease bite was handled as per RAW.<br/><br/>While the disease was handled by the rules, the particulars about available treatments and such were derived by the GM from the setting precepts - historical fantasy genre for starters, and he clearly assumed that the bite of the hell dog was an esoteric ailment that wouldn't be familiar to most doctors. Nothing particularly special to that, you'd see the same sort of deductions at any old school table. The conclusion was also, of course, completely kosher for an old school challengeful game, it was just the player who was entirely unwilling to entertain the possibility that their character would die unheroically of a disease - or almost as bad, would have to recuperate for weeks upon weeks while he'd play another character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442724/#Comment_442724" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-09T20:41:00+00:00" title="February  9, 2015  8:41PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Makes sense!

They were given chance after chance: not provoke the bats, out-AC the bat's attack, out-dex the narrow rope bridge, remember to activate their Immovable Rods, out-HP the 5d6 fall, out-save death itself. That's six chances, but four of those are "numbers vs numbers", not much you can do once play sets in.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442762">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442762/#Comment_442762" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-11T13:26:42+00:00" title="February 11, 2015  1:26PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The agenda ambiguity is really a huge problem for 5E, which is such a shame since it isn't hard to run it in a way that's more focused, you just have to know what you're doing from running other games.

It's a somewhat difficult, somewhat tragic phenomenon when gamers who have only limited tools for appreciating anything but dungeon fantasy experience their go-to game transforming away from under their feet like this.
