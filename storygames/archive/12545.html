Rules clarifications, OK. Table talk, yes. Suggestions, no. Direct speech, no.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm becoming more and more convinced that this school of thought is a load of nonsense. At least, with regard to suggestions. Letting players make them is a way of keeping everyone engaged with the game, even if their characters aren't present. Player involvement trumps wrong-headed considerations of realism.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my regular players gets extremely annoyed if players whose characters aren't present make suggestions.

If there are players whose characters aren't at the scene, I'll usually let them shout out suggestions (e.g. "Cut the blue wire!"; "Swim for the shore!"; "Throw a grenade down the chute") if I think that their ideas would naturally occur to a properly trained agent (which most players are not) as a matter of course. This really helps bring the social gamers or less-than-brilliant players up to speed with the more accomplished folks. <br/>But I'll cut them off and prohibit the suggested action if what is being recommended is either unduly esoteric or especially clever. So sometimes I'll say "you're not there" when somebody has called out an ingenious but non-obvious suggestion that would have saved the day, and the exquisite pain on everybody's part when that happens adds enormously to the overall suspense.

It's perfectly feasible to not cheat, and after all the characters in reality have knowledge the players don't have and access to information even the GM doesn't have, so metagaming serves as a substitute.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281660/#Comment_281660" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-19T10:33:38+00:00" title="July 19, 2010 10:33AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            4e can be absolutely RUINED by people kibitzing - either because one player is overly forceful and essentially playing everyone else's characters for them or because everyone is debating every action and delaying the game in a catastrophic way.

We're playing pretend, after all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd say player participation and interest are far more valuable than a sense of realism in almost every RPG context. There are edge cases (like Paranoia), but the examples I can think of all share a competitive aspect.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's about trust. If a suggestion is unduly clever, I would hope the player would say (ooc) "Wish I could think of that!" and move on. Exactly the same way as if a smart player was playing a dumb character, or the player has some metagame knowledge and didn't let it influence his character unduly. It's <i>fun</i> to play with metagame knowledge a little, in exactly the same ways as you do with stage improv, as long as you don't turn it into a weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the 1:1 correspondence between player and character is not the most helpful way of thinking about it. <i>As a group</i>, we have responsibility for the characters in the game <i>as a group</i>.

That's fine.<br/><br/>Others - I suspect that a lot of people here at Story Games are like this - like the tension that comes from the story as a whole - juxtaposing scenes and interactions to create a kind of dramatic tension and irony. Like my character commenting how he's sure that Joe Bloggs will be along to help any minute, knowing that Joe Bloggs in just the last scene has been tied up by the villain. That's fine too.<br/><br/>Of course, and I happen to play with Queex and have encountered the player he's referring to, sometimes both these type of players are in the same game, and while the first type are fine when they're not present for scenes with the second type; the second type of player can get snapped at when they make a comment when the positions are reversed. My solution tends to be setting up some sort of in game reason why all the players are in communication to sidestep the problem.<br/><br/>Aside from the old stand by of chatting as a group and figuring out the groups comfort zone for these things of course.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281702/#Comment_281702" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-19T11:35:02+00:00" title="July 19, 2010 11:35AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes!

I'm not interested in playing games where people shut down while their character's not in the scene; I want a group who's all interested and excited in <i>everybody's</i> shit, and I want a game procedure that bolsters that and prevents it from getting boring. Quick transitions when characters are apart is one way to help that. Allowing at least some kinds of input from those in the dugout is another.<br/><br/>Which brings us to the former issue: what input when? Here's where it gets more nuanced and individual to different games or creative agenda. Tio start with, I thik this problem can be further subdivided into: <i>How much help and advice should you give other players?</i> as distinct from <i>Should you talk when your character's not involved?</i> Working backwards again, of COURSE you should talk when you're "not there," because sitting silently while others get to speak is going to make the proceedings tedious, and we want the game to be interesting and fun at all times for everyone. That said, the talk should be the kind that's non-disruptive, by whatever the standards and tastes of the group: non-tone-breaking (no Monty Python quotes. no snarky quips in a serious scene, etc.), non-intrusive (don't talk over people, don't start an involved conversation when the scene players are deep into it, etc.) and whatever else the group values.<br/><br/>So now we get down to "what help, and how much?" which in my experience is perhaps the stickiest issue. it's largely game- and group-dependent; Adam rightly points out that in a game like 4E with it's clearly delineated mechanical options, if you give too much "advice" you're basically playing all the characters. But even outside of that particular paradigm, I've found that if someone is too zealous in suggesting options, I end up feeling like there's nothing much for me to contribute--WHETHER THAT PLAYER'S CHARACTER IS THERE OR NOT. And of course, the more emotionally invested a situation is, the more I'm going to feel like that choice is mine and mine alone to make. I'll feel robbed if someone jumps in with "Oooh, what if you throw your wedding ring down at her feet, and leave her right then and there, and drive across town to shoot her lover?"<br/><br/>Also, I've seen new and inexperienced players subjected to this treatment and just shut down, creatively and socially. They're too polite to object, but the wresting of control is palpable. Often they seem to think that this is just the way things are supposed to go, and it colors their impression of the whole activity. And it makes me sad.<br/><br/>So that issue has nothing to do with "realism" or "metagaming" or any of that mess--I think the "you're not there!" ploy is a defense akin to nailing a Mafia Don for tax evasion. The GM in that instance probably wants to see what player A will do in this or that tense situation, and player B keeps butting in with all this overbearing "help." So when he has 'im dead to rights, the GM brings down the "not there" hammer, 'cause at least in THAT situation, there's no plausible way to justify the character advising the other, and we finally get so see what Player A will do at crunch time. The "there-ness" issue in that case is a red herring--have you ever seen a group of players in the space of a single combat round (six seconds, right?) coordinate an extremely detailed and synergistic attack plan between them, to the consternation of the GM? Same thing.<br/><br/>So what we really have is an issue of social appropriateness in advice-giving, (possibly) a form of social bullying, and the issue of how to solve it--more social bullying, by a group authority figure, or some other way? Maybe we should turn to discussing what those other ways would look like? I mean, it boils down to social instincts, but how to foster that if players struggle with them or don't have them? Just saying "respect everyone" or "value everyone's input" isn't helpful at that point. Like, <i>how?</i> What does that <i>look </i>like?<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281725/#Comment_281725" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-19T12:43:21+00:00" title="July 19, 2010 12:43PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 19, 2010 12:45PM by lordgoon.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Queex</cite><cite>Posted By: lordgoon</cite>But is it really so easy for you to determine at the drop of a hat precisely what might or might not naturally occur to the character you're playing without external aid?

I think it's important to realize that they're all about the <i>player</i> talking--they have nothing at all to do with the characters talking:<br/><br/>1. Social acceptability of speaking up when we're trying to get input from another player. If you're too loud, Jane doesn't get to say her piece, that's no fun. This is probably the most common issue, right? You need to know when to shut up--but it's not really about "realism" or where your character's sitting. It's about when you, [insert your name here], are talking all over your friends.<br/><br/>2. Tactical decisions--in a context where the "right" decision is important, especially a tactical game that's supposed to be a test of your (the player's) wits, someone else suggesting something to you that's better than what you might have thought of yourself is effectively "cheating". Your wits are no longer being tested.<br/><br/>3. Some people's desire for a certain type of immersion: to have the information they receive as they play to be as close as possible to what their character is receiving/experiencing. That player may want to leave the room when they're not in the scene, for instance. In their case, even a reasonable and socially-polite interjection or advice from the other players can distract them from their desired sense of immersion ("my character can't hear you!").<br/><br/>In any case, here's where it comes down to for me:<br/><br/>If a player can ONLY speak in-character in your game--that's important to the game aesthetic somehow--then, yeah, if you're not in the scene, don't talk. But if you can offer out-of-game advice when your character is in the scene, but you won't let another player do the same just because their character "isn't there"... that's total bullshit.<br/><br/>To me "don't offer advice when you're not there" only makes sense in conjunction with "don't speak out-of-character, period."<br/><br/><br/><i>[ETA: And I have to laugh, because this was cross-posted with Roger, above.

My current CoC group are usually in favor of OOC speaking, kibbitzing, giving advice and whatever, until a "tension scene" arrives. "Tension scenes" are things like visiting the haunted house, being stalked by ghouls, and similar stuff. The kind of scenes that, in a movie, would have a creepy soundtrack. At that moment, the only people talking are those whose PCs are present. Other people talking would distract from the tension of the scene.<br/>\n<br/>\nmigo's POV makes a lot of sense to me, as it does the skydiving example.

I was under the impression that the original issue behind this thread was that there's something <i>wrong</i> with friction breaking out between players, or between a player and the GM, about "You're not there"-ish issues. My point was that these sorts of disagreements are often not only integral to, but part of the fun of trying to play a character as accurately as possible. Assuming that you'd be willing to include these sorts of creative disputes amongst the processes you're describing here, it sounds like we agree after all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Queex" title="Queex"><img alt="Queex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Queex">Queex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282305/#Comment_282305" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-22T05:20:57+00:00" title="July 22, 2010  5:20AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's something wrong, though,  if the cause of the friction is 'you're not there- shut up', because a good 19 times out of 20 'you're not there' is a cobblers reason to say 'shut up'.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_282406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282406/#Comment_282406" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-22T10:06:53+00:00" title="July 22, 2010 10:06AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yeah, I've got no problem at all with creative disputes and stuff.<br><br>I even don't have a problem with telling people to shut up when they're damaging things by <i>not</i> shutting up (frex, people talking over people).

This style of play gets a bad rap because it has been abused by so many self-absorbed powergaming nerds who just want to build up their stats like they're playing <i>Ultima</i> or something.

character isn't present in a scene, you shouldn't contribute to it. Rules clarifications, OK. Table talk, yes. Suggestions, no. Direct speech, no.<br/><br/>I'm becoming more and more convinced that this school of thought is a load of nonsense. At least, with regard to suggestions. Letting players make them is a way of keeping everyone engaged with the game, even if their characters aren't present. Player involvement trumps wrong-headed considerations of realism.</blockquote>I beg to differ. Going for, not 'realism', but <i>immersion</i> and <i>deeper emotional engagement</i>, I find it best for the players to interact with the elements of the game which are present in the scene, and to hold the other elements (and their possible players) back until they have a scene to show themselves in.<br/><br/>Having players commenting on the drama all the time, giving suggestions or jokiing about, makes the game into a chatty happening more than a vibrant fiction. It is alright if you really like the chatty style, but if you're into vibrant and engaging fiction you are better off having the players (and the GM) exercise some silent and observant patience from time to time. Let the other players have their moment with their characters, and they will give you yours.<br/><br/>A role-playing game, in spite of being a dialogue-based activity, don't really need all of us to chatter on all the time.

So much so that I regularly ask other players to be quiet when another player has the spotlight.  <br/>I've also had issues with over-talkitive players trying to give "help" in tactics, etc...  when it's NOT wanted.  Once a player actually yelled at another for "helping" too much.  So.........<br/><br/>My gangs do a couple things for this....<br/><br/>-  try to stay in-character at the table<br/>-  if there's a rule question, cross your fingers and hold that hand up to ask<br/>-  if a player seems stumped, another can ask if he'd like some help.  If so wished, that player can ONLY receive the "help" if his character makes a "Wisdom/Int"  check.  If made the player gives some insight or ideas to the other, mimicking as if the character thought of the idea himself.<br/><br/><br/>Overall I'm cool with table-talk, it's a game... we're friends,  we should be enjoying the time.  Then again, we all need to be respectful and watch just HOW MUCH time is  "taken away"  from game if we're off topic.  It's a measure of respect for the game time.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>-kev-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12545/youre-not-there-shut-up" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12545/youre-not-there-shut-up" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12545/youre-not-there-shut-up/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F12545%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F12545%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
