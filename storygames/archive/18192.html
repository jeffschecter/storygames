I've been wanting to break into freelance illustration for a long time but since it would be more of a hobby than a career, I haven't had time to build up the kind of portfolio that I would like. I'm interested in doing commissioned work for RPG designers on a pay what you can basis (hell, even just for a free copy of the finished product). The art work would be owned outright by the commissioner, I would just like to retain rights to use it for self-promotion/portfolio work. Minimum prices would be based off of the complexity of the work, the time to complete it in and the resources of the author.<br/><br/>I have some examples on my deviant art page, though there not the strongest. I'll try to add whatever other art I have lying around when I have time. If anyone's interested in sliding a few bucks my way in exchange for some pretty pictures, whisper me and I'll give you more contact information.<br/><br/><a href="http://fabledelf.deviantart.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://fabledelf.deviantart.com/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
