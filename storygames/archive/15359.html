The biggest thing that made ME understand the way things work in these games is Actual Play podcasts(I still try to find a good one of whatever game I'm trying to learn). This isn't the type of thing you can normally include in the rulebook though, so the next best thing is Examples of Play. Frequent and useful ones. I myself think that the route to go with for maximum understanding is full example of play paired with a miniature, specialized example for each rule. A single narrative tied through the examples is often a nice touch for me, but I think it works without that too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_348809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348809/#Comment_348809" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-13T05:42:22+00:00" title="November 13, 2011  5:42AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Mark,<br/><br/>I don't think there's a single resource that would be valuable for every kind of game. In fact, something like that would probably be guaranteed to be bland and vaguely useless.<br/><br/>Like Max said, when I'm picking up a game that is weird or different, I usually look up Actual Play posts (or podcasts) and read forum posts, here or elsewhere, where other people talk about the game.<br/><br/>But there's no substitute for sitting down and playing. That usually answers 75% of the questions. And then, when you take the other 25% of your questions to the internet ("Hey, I played 'Witch Doctor Boogaloo' last week and I'm confused as to how the red counting stones are supposed to work. Help a brother out."), you'll have the context to both ask sensibly and make sense of the answers.<br/><br/>So, I guess ... Read AP --&gt; PLAY --&gt; Post AP <br/><br/>What specific games are you trying to wrap your head around?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_348814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348814/#Comment_348814" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-13T09:11:52+00:00" title="November 13, 2011  9:11AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I read a shitload of stories.<br/><br/>(I also regret not taking classes about literature much in college?

Sometimes you will crash and burn, and that's edifying too.<br/><br/>So to answer your question, a game should be written to assume immediate half-baked play, by an enthusiastic group who half-read the rules.

I signed up because I want to learn how to do it in two."<br/><br/>And because he articulated that desire, I made sure to show him all my tricks for speeding up play and point out the things I was doing as I did them. It was, at least to that guy, a teaching game. So when you play with people who are more experienced, approach it intentionally and seek to learn the things you want to know more about. Whether you are overt about it or just pay close attention to others doing things you want to improve, I think this is a great way to hone your own skills.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_348821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MarkT" title="MarkT"><img alt="MarkT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/983/nP0EE6Z6XSTVP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MarkT">MarkT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348821/#Comment_348821" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-13T11:17:59+00:00" title="November 13, 2011 11:17AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great advice all around guys, thank you.
