Whereas other sorts of games (sports, board games, etc) have more established rules they can agree to follow, which is easier to manage on the social side of things. I believe (but could be wrong) that child psychologists often say that there is a certain phase in most children's growth where they become interested in strict rules and authority, and following those. This phase probably corresponds closely to the age where most kids stop doing the "let's pretend" thing--in the 8-12 age bracket or something like that.<br/><br/>(Now, I'm not an expert in this field, or even well-informed, so if anyone can either support that statement and give more information, or let me know why and how it's wrong, I would be very interested to hear that!)<br/><br/>Anyway, the funny thing I noticed was that these kids who were playing out in the yard, even though they weren't "playing pretend", were totally comfortable with making rules on the fly, with no apparent logic to it, and almost always accepted with very little argument. For instance, at one point one of the girls ran behind the tree to hide from the other girl holding the hose. Immediately, on of the other kids shouted, "You're not allowed to go behind the tree!" So, she stepped out and got sprayed. From then on, no one went behind the tree. Unless they changed that "rule" later.<br/><br/>It was tremendously fluid, with the rules of their games being negotiated, established, and sometimes (but rarely) broken, much like the way a roleplaying group negotiates and establishes what's happening in the fiction of a roleplaying game.<br/><br/><i>Interesting</i>, I thought. For these kids, playing (say) a sport or a board game is not any more structured or any more rigid than play "let's pretend".                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273308/#Comment_273308" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-27T10:18:11+00:00" title="May 27, 2010 10:18AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wonder what the underlying psychology of the "no tree" rule might be.

The "no tree" rule probably arose simply because it's a safe spot, where you can't be sprayed with the hose. Which takes the fun out of it. It's basically a kid's version of "Try that another way".  From my experience with kids rules and interdictions arise when some condition or (god forgive me) narration would offer someone an unfair advantage (and/or make them "win") or break their expectations of what is supposed to happen next. <br/><br/>Again, from my experience, Jesse also has a point, kids soon establish a pecking order and in fact become confused or disoriented when there is no "boss" (although they often give the role of "boss" on someone, and then force "the boss" to do what <i>they</i> want, so that's another interesting development).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273323/#Comment_273323" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-27T10:50:27+00:00" title="May 27, 2010 10:50AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 27, 2010 10:53AM by David_Berg.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, most RPGs don't have a rule for every fictional situation, right?<br/><br/><span style="color: #000088;"><b>Player 1:</b> "I cast super-cheap Sphere of Containment!

I really wish i'd picked it up at the time, as I've long since forgotten the title. The book was geared to that same age group or even slightly younger kids.<br/><br/>What struck me as interesting was that there was a whole section of a activities I'd class as being sorts of open-ended RPGs. They'd have a sort of fictional set up, some ideas for characters and events, and maybe some prop ideas, but no hardcoded rules of any kind.

A group could evolve so as to allow one person to emerge as a leader, but it was clearly a part of normal play that any participant could change rules and invent new rules at any time. I'm not sure why, but that was kind of poignant to me: to see this group of people very naturally do this fluid thing where making up new rules was in no way strange or unnatural, and not a point of argument, because it's just part of *how they play*.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite><br/>Edit: Oh, and as to the title of this thread, I've actually pondered a good bit about that specific example, especially since it has been used in a fair few RPG texts over the years.

Someone just pointed out in one of the other threads that most RPGs have unspoken rules along these lines. For instance, in a one-shot at a Con, there's a rule that's never verbalized but usually followed: if it all possible, character death is not on the line until the end of the session. If a situation comes up in the first five minutes of play that could kill a character, everyone will typically jump on board to making sure that doesn't happen. However, at some point later towards the end of the session, character death quite distinctly becomes "on the line": some level of dramatic tension is reached that makes death a worthwhile threat or meaningful outcome without removing the player from the meat of play.<br/><br/>It's interesting that I've never heard anyone discuss this explicitly, or deal with it with explicit rules. Very interesting!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273400/#Comment_273400" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-28T00:21:50+00:00" title="May 28, 2010 12:21AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another interesting thing is that kids can switch quickly in and out of the fiction.

In some cases it might a child who oversteps their 'authority' by making rules when they aren't recognized as having the right to do so. Sometimes it's about what's fair and fun. Other times I think it's an instinctive sense of what would be fun, sort of like riffing around the game table about what might make a scene particularly awesome.<br/><br/>I was quite shocked the other day at an event at my daughter's school when two first graders ran past me playing tag. When the chaser tagged the runner, the both spun around and did 1-2-3 rock-paper-scissors to resolve the tag. It totally blew me away. Apparently the boys in the class had a problem where everyone wanted to be "it" at the same time and there wasn't enough running. The teacher helped them devise a form of tag with multilpe "its" where conflicts are resolved using rock-paper-scissors.
