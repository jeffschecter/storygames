Some games like Mouse Guard have each character with a unique goal that is tied to the mission. What about \u201cplay to find out\u201d games that have no end set?<br/><br/>What are some of the best ways/worst ways games have done this?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390799/#Comment_390799" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-19T10:36:07+00:00" title="September 19, 2012 10:36AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 19, 2012 10:37AM by Rickard.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The most important thing is to give the players a goal that they may follow through the game. You may hiss all you like at the concept "You're sitting in a tavern and mysterious stranger walks through the door. He looks at you and ...", but it actually does the thing well: to give the players a goal with the adventure. Here are some other ways.<br/><br/>You are part of a group, for example a ghostbusters firm in InSpectres with clients seeking them up or a bunch of shadowrunners that are hired by a Mr Johnson.<br/><br/>You get a letter from an (unknown) relative who needs help. (Call of Cthulhu)<br/><br/>The players creates acquaintances that the PC's care about, that the GM then creates scenarios around.<br/><br/>The participants create a relationship map (including the PCs) around a specific event and then some kind of goal for their PC. (Svart av kval, vit av l\xf6gn / Black of Despair, White of Lie)<br/><br/>In my game This Is Pulp, all participants make up stuff on a map and after that they all decide together one thing on the map that the characters are after. Other than the map, there's no preparation in that game.<br/><br/>In Archipelago II all players write one destiny each to all the other PCs and then the player who plays a certain character choose one to follow. It's one of those "One story per character" kind of game.<br/><br/>But remember, all these are about creating a goal for the players to follow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390800/#Comment_390800" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-19T10:50:17+00:00" title="September 19, 2012 10:50AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>They don't consider 'characters' and 'plot' to be separate elements that need to be tied together, but instead generate plot entirely out of the characters' situation, goals, motivation, etc. (e.g. In A Wicked Age.)

I heard it called the Call of Cthulhu premise, because the set up make it very clear that you will need to create characters that even if it not natural stick to the plot:<br/><br/><i>"No normal person would go poking around deeper and deeper into unknown mind shattering terror. But in Call of Cthulhu you do. You will have to come up with character that no matter what just keep on poking around and stick together until they die or something worse happens to them."</i><br/><br/>---<br/><br/>The way I like to do it personally however is to start with quite minimalistic character and play o find out what happens. I leave the character concepts very open and exploring how the character are involved in the plot and what motivations they have to purse the plot is one of the things we leave open to explore trough play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390819/#Comment_390819" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-19T14:03:51+00:00" title="September 19, 2012  2:03PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 19, 2012 9:20PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Of all the World of Darkness games, I thought Wraith: The Oblivion did the best job of tying the characters to plot elements. Passions and Fetters were basically a roadmap for everyone at the table, telling them what was important to the characters as well as what motivated them, which is at least half of the work that goes into making character-focused plots right there.\n<blockquote>Creating characters before or in conjunction with building up the plot makes for instant buy-in, with less doubt about why the PCs would be involved.</blockquote>\nYeah, you really can't go wrong by making those connections at every stage of the game. Pitch the premise of the game early so people can think of characters who would engage with that premise, make characters as a group and reinforce the relationships between them all and with the premise of the game, direct the plot according to who the characters are and tie plot elements directly to character elements whenever possible...the more points of connection you establish, the better the buy-in becomes and the tighter the story gets.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390840/#Comment_390840" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-19T20:56:21+00:00" title="September 19, 2012  8:56PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Riddle of Steel is a personal perennial fave, and what got me into indie games in the first place. You define the five things your character is willing to fight and quite possibly die for. Those things, called Spiritual Attributes, are brilliantly tied into both the combat system and the advancement mechanics.
