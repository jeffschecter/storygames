But this session, and this game, are too good not to share.  </i><br/><br/>We were short two people for our regular TSOY game, so we played PSI RUN last night.  It went very well!<br/><br/>We cut the memories down to three each, to accommodate our narrow window of play.  We reached Crossroads in about two hours, with three players and one GM.  <br/><br/>Questions took some time \xe2\u20ac\u201c I left it wide open and, without guidance, all three came up with different sorts of characters. One was a weirdo in a green suit and mirrored eyes, one was a guy in a business suit with Scanners-like mindkilling powers, and one was a woman in a jumpsuit who \xe2\u20ac\u0153knew everything but her name\xe2\u20ac\x9d.  We rolled with it and everything was resolved in a satisfying way.<br/><br/>We played five scenes, and each player had one conflict, on average, in each.  <br/><br/>Some really juicy questions, and the answers:<br/><br/>How can I feel again?  (Only by being hurt)<br/>Who or what is \xe2\u20ac\u0153Marco Polo\xe2\u20ac\x9d?  (My trigger phrase)<br/>Why do people I get angry at die?  (Because I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve learned how to work the chip in all our heads) \xe2\u20ac\u201c that\xe2\u20ac\u2122s \xe2\u20ac\u0153all\xe2\u20ac\x9d, as in \xe2\u20ac\u0153every living human being\xe2\u20ac\x9d!<br/>What are these keys in my pocket?  (Keys to the Hole in Pittsboro)<br/>Who is The Man With No Eyes?  (The evil Dr. Lazarus)<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.meekmok.com/sassy/images/psi_run/psi_run_01.jpg"/><br/><br/>We set it in our home town and began with a massive car wreck (triggered by a suicide bomber in a Ford Festiva) in I-40, at exit 253.  There was a lot of fun and collateral damage as the characters took refuge in the Mardis Gras bowling alley, then stole a liquor truck and headed for <a href="http://eyeball-series.org/bighole-eyeball.htm" rel="nofollow">The Hole</a> \xe2\u20ac\u201c an infamous (and real) Cold War AUTOVON station outside Pittsboro, which we found out was a secret cloning facility and nest of evil.  There they confronted their creator, Dr. Lazarus, and returned to the creche where they were all decanted.  Cue the huge fight with elite government \xe2\u20ac\u0153Psi Troopers\xe2\u20ac\x9d, unleashing the Robotron defense droid, Crossroads for all, and fade to black.  <br/><br/>So the scenes were CRASH \xe2\u20ac\u201c BOWLING ALLEY \xe2\u20ac\u201c I-40 \xe2\u20ac\u201c THE HOLE \xe2\u20ac\u201c LIVING QUARTERS.  Here's a photo mid-game (the army dude is the chasers):<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.meekmok.com/sassy/images/psi_run/psi_run_02.jpg"/><br/><br/>Questions and comments we had:<br/><br/>1.  We all really wanted some mechanical adversity!  Outside of narrative there was no meaning to the arrival of the chasers.  Did I miss a rule?  What about injury \xe2\u20ac\u201c also color, short of death?  If we play again, we\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll probably require the use of the lowest die in a chaser scene and require the loss of the highest die if a character is injured.<br/><br/>2.  The chase itself is obviated toward endgame.  We had them all piled up at the end and it fit the story but was not freighted with any meaning.  Maybe this is a three-question only problem, not seen in a normal game?  Also, when does the chase begin?  We started immediately.  <br/><br/>3.  The short game worked just fine, for the most part.  No characters died, and many of the decisions were not that tough \xe2\u20ac\u201c I guess they rolled well.  <br/><br/>4.  We had a great time and PSI RUN is going into my bag for pick-up games!  Really solid and fun.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thor" title="thor"><img alt="thor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/thorhansen/Pictures?authkey=Gv1sRgCKPylM61jtOQbA#5529849930194336866"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thor">thor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89692/#Comment_89692" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-23T06:31:48+00:00" title="August 23, 2007  6:31AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Questions and comments we had:<br/><br/>1.

As far as I can tell, if your goal is to kill them you have that capacity.<br/><br/>I was thinking over at the Ash Can website that there might be a way to make some bad guys stronger within the story. Taking a que from Universalis, if a bad guy doesn't have a name they can be wiped out as always; but if a bad guy becomes invested in by the GM they can survive scenes which would kill other mooks. This fits the types of story we are telling and shouldn't be deprotagonizing. <br/><br/>Also it gives the GM more to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89696/#Comment_89696" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-23T06:38:44+00:00" title="August 23, 2007  6:38AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What impact does damage have on player characters, short of death, other than descriptive color?<br/><br/>What impact does the presence of the chasers have in a scene, other than descriptive color?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Iso" title="Iso"><img alt="Iso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Iso">Iso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89714/#Comment_89714" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-23T07:38:33+00:00" title="August 23, 2007  7:38AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (I was one of the players)<br/><br/>Here's another question that I had after playing: it seems like you could have several rolls in a scene.  Is that right?  For example:<br/><br/>Scene: Bowling Alley<br/><br/>Character 1: tries to stop attendant from calling the police (rolls)<br/>Character 2: tries to soothe a child frightened by his appearance (rolls)<br/><br/>Which means that there are *two* opportunities in that scene for the chasers to advance.  In a livelier, even more rolling heavy scene (say, Character 2 accidentally traps someone underneath some rubble by using psi powers and Character 3 wants to try to free them before they are crushed), the chasers get yet more chances.<br/><br/>Which makes it seems like the chasers will almost always be right on top of the players as opposed to just chasing them.  Now, again, without a lot of mechanical oomph, that isn't terrible, but it seems to make most scenes about the chasers being right on top of the players.  That's good or bad depending on preferences, but it seems a little weird.<br/><br/>It also makes the chaser option in the die rolling seem not all that threatening--if they are going to be on top of us already, what's the harm of putting one more bad roll there?   <br/><br/>I know that we, players, definitely put several bad die rolls to the chasers without much concern because it just didn't matter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89723">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chris_moore" title="chris_moore"><img alt="chris_moore" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://jesus8880.com/chapters/gematria/images/greek%20letters/psi-cap.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chris_moore">chris_moore</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89723/#Comment_89723" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-23T07:59:45+00:00" title="August 23, 2007  7:59AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, all,<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm so glad you played.  Here are some ideas we are working on that might address your questions:<br/>\n<br/>\nMechanical Adversity/Chasers:<br/>\n<br/>\nOne idea - When Chasers have arrived (or are ahead), you replace the Chase category with Capture.  5-6 no one captured, 3-4 one player captured (GM choice), 1-2 all players captured (Vincent's idea, which I like).  This spiral *could* end with your character being out of the game ("reeducated", labotomized, etc.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nInjury:<br/>\nInjury, right now, is color.  Some ideas we have are:<br/>\n-a penalty die for injuries.<br/>\n-converting long-term and permanent injuries ("Scars") into disappointing elements in the Crossroads scene; making the Scar somehow frustrate a character's goals in the epilogue.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way:  Depending on preferences, won't there always be a "dump" category?  Or can we tweak each step in every category to make them universally meaningful?  I'm going to think about this great feedback.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, and keep posting!  <br/>\n-Chris                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89725/#Comment_89725" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-23T08:03:41+00:00" title="August 23, 2007  8:03AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 23, 2007 11:10AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Chris!<br/><br/>By the way, our desire for mechanical consequences is really a tell for our preferences - I totally get the idea of a game without them.

How many rolls, on average, do you guys expect in each scene?  With three players, that's a lot of pressure to move the chasers forward if they each get one conflict per scene, and if they get two or more, it seems inevitable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chris_moore" title="chris_moore"><img alt="chris_moore" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://jesus8880.com/chapters/gematria/images/greek%20letters/psi-cap.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chris_moore">chris_moore</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90113/#Comment_90113" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-24T09:42:58+00:00" title="August 24, 2007  9:42AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sometimes I toy with the idea of: 4-6: no Chaser advance,  1-3: Chasers advance 1 scene.

It feels a little like the 6 in Charisma in the old D&amp;D game: why not do it when there really ins't much of a mechanical penalty.<br/><br/>I do really like the sound of Chase becoming capture--holy crap that amps up the chase!
