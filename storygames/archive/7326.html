Generally, it's either "Roll to decrypt" or some variant of "Encryption is impossible/not interesting/won't appear on-screen", which is somewhat understandable (It is, sadly, a somewhat fringe topic.) but also wastes a lot of the potential, IMO. <br/><br/>(At least in the games I know. There probably is a "Gurps PGP" out there that I don't know about but thatw ill be mentioned any second now. ^_^ )<br/><br/>So I've been thinking about sitting down to write a short "Gamers Guide to Encryption" to explain the basic principles, maybe a tiny bit of history (Cause, really, people far better and more knowledgeable then me have already written lots about those.) and then ways this could be integrated in a game, whether as obstacle or asset or whatever. Probably just a couple of pages and hopefully genre-spanning. (Though, obviously, with a focus on modern/SciFi, as the more we step away from that, the less "How things work now" applies.) For a 15 minutes example, I added a page about <a href="http://arcana.wikidot.com/public-key-encryption" rel="nofollow">Asymetric/Public Key Encryption</a> to J\xfcrgen Huberts nifty Arcana Wiki a while back.<br/><br/>So, my question before I actually sit down to research/write it: Would there be interest? Would you as a gamer have use for that? Or is it a case where those that are interested have already edicated themselves and everybody else not giving a shit? Or maybe there's already something like this out there that I missed?<br/><br/>Anyway, looking forward to your comments/ideas/thoughts.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_162774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162774/#Comment_162774" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-15T11:38:24+00:00" title="August 15, 2008 11:38AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are you talking about codes and ciphers, or the encryption of digital data?

Is there any sort of overlap between the two?</blockquote>Well, basically they are different application of the same "thing", as far as I'm concerned. <br/><br/>To quote <a>Wikipedia:</a> "<i>In cryptography, encryption is the process of transforming information (referred to as plaintext) using an algorithm (called cipher) to make it unreadable to anyone except those possessing special knowledge, usually referred to as a key.</i><br/><br/>So the difference between a simple Caesar Cypher ("Take the letter and shift it one step to the left of the alphabet") and something like RSA is just what kind of Cypher is used and how it is implemented, but the general idea/goal/method is the same: Do something to data to hide the meaning of said data. <br/><br/>(Ok, I lied. IIRC, there can be a case made for "Code" being <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher" rel="nofollow">substitution</a> on the level of words where a Cypher operates on the level of letters and stuff like that. Could missremember, though.)<br/><br/>For the text, I'd try to cover both electronic and "old-school" types of encryption, though with something of a focus on the current state, ie. electronic encryption through symetric and asymetric means, PGP, that whole shebang. Old-School Cyphers would appear and become especially relevant in a low-magic fantasy or historical context, though. (Cause magic could operate along similar principles to electronic encryption.) And fascinating historical snippets like the Cryptography craze of the 19th and early 20th century, with lovers writing each others encrypted love-letters through newspaper ads, just have to make an appearence. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Does that answer your questions?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_162780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162780/#Comment_162780" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-15T12:13:29+00:00" title="August 15, 2008 12:13PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I think so.<br/><br/>Sounds interesting.

(And also has a chapter about the future, some potential implications of stuff like Quantum Computing or Quantum Cryptography.) It's where I have most of my knowledge about the history of Cryptography from. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_162785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162785/#Comment_162785" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-15T12:31:22+00:00" title="August 15, 2008 12:31PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 15, 2008 12:34PM by renatoram.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For modern encryption, it should be simple: it's either "fake encryption" like many of the broken implementations found in small commercial programs (and so needs a "computer research" skill check to find a suitable cracking program) or "strong/true encryption", which means "YOU WILL NOT BREAK IT". So the goal should be "find the password and steal the private key", because deciphering something encrypted with Blowfish, AES and such simply is not gonna happen. Unless you move to scifi <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>If OTOH you want "movies encryption" it's a whole other kettle of fish, obviously (you normally have a very practical "override" button hidden somewhere, or you mash the keyboard very fast without EVER pressing space or touching the mouse).<br/><br/>For anyone interested in a really good book on encryption that reads like a novel I recommend Simon Singh's Codes and Secrets (IIRC) which goes from the antiquity up to quantum cryptography in the modern age, passing through caesar, queen Mary Stuart, the decoding of LinearB and the egyptian hieroglyphs, the ENIGMA machine and modern public key encryption.

The entropy content of ordinary human-readable text is quite low; to get 256 bits of entropy, you need a passphrase that's more than 20 words long. In fact, most people use three- or four-word passphrases.\n<blockquote>A message encrypted with a 1024bit key (which is short, nowadays) would take some MILLION years to decrypt, AFAIR.</blockquote>\nYou're thinking of an asymmetric cipher. The entropy in a 1024-bit RSA key is <em>much</em> less than 1024 bits (because it's not an arbitrary number, it's a product of two primes). Furthermore, the weak point in an asymmetric cryptosystem isn't the private key, it's the (much shorter) session key, and I'm not aware of any symmetric cryptosystem that uses arbitrary 1024-bit keys.<br/><br/>But as I said above, key length is irrelevant in the presence of weak passphrases.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_162850">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162850/#Comment_162850" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-16T06:17:29+00:00" title="August 16, 2008  6:17AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 16, 2008 6:18AM by Lord_Minx.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: renatoram</cite>So yeah, basically you could do a game supplement on the history of cryptography but it would have to be better, cheaper and more "gameable" than Singh's book <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/></blockquote>Well, it would certainly be cheaper, as I wouldn't charge anything for it. ^_^<br/><br/>(After all, this would be just a short article by an interested amateur.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Metal Fatigue</cite>It's not necessarily the case that something enciphered with AES or Blowfish is immune to cracking.

I'm reminded of the Schneier article about secure passwords/phrases, where he described how most operating systems/programs leak keys and passwords like mad, so a huge number of passwords are broken with a dictionary consisting of printable strings taken from the hard disk.<br/><br/>But yeah, even with perfect implementation, secure Cyphers and proper key length, the easiest target is still the user and his password.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_162861">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162861/#Comment_162861" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-16T11:31:41+00:00" title="August 16, 2008 11:31AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Lord Minx</cite>But yeah, even with perfect implementation, secure Cyphers and proper key length, the easiest target is still the user and his password</blockquote>\ne-xactly! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Why try to crack it when you can ask for the password?<br/>And by ask, I mean anything ranging from police interrogation to packing the poor sod and shipping him to guantanamo, to handing him to egypt to have him tortured on your behalf...<br/><br/>The true paranoid should always have some mean to securely destroy the data while appearing collaborative (as in, one passphrase opens the data, the other one destroys it silently).<br/><br/>Ah, cypherpunks... <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_162867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162867/#Comment_162867" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-16T12:59:02+00:00" title="August 16, 2008 12:59PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now there is something for the guide ... dumpster diving, information mining, password concealment ... these are gaming angles.
