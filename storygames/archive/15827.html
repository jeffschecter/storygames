It's obvious but the execution... brilliant! And I've been trying to avoid hyperbole like using the word "brilliant" for less than brilliant things. But I think it's true here.<br/><br/>The Mega Man video teaches you how to design scenarios that teach game rules as you play without realizing you are learning. As a bonus, the video is like a Luke &amp; Jared game design seminar if they were 19 and on speed. <br/><br/><br/>Let's take <a href="http://www.dungeon-world.com/" rel="nofollow">Dungeon World</a>. <br/><br/><br/>Specifically the <a href="http://www.dungeon-world.com/index.php/download_file/view/9/76/" rel="nofollow">Move List</a>. Could we design a Dungeon that used the techniques in the above Mega Man video to teach you these moves, step by step, room by room, without making it feel like a tutorial? <br/><br/>I think we can. <br/><br/>I would love if more games taught me how to play this way. Let me just play. Let me figure it out. And subtly teach it to me as I also have fun. <br/><br/><br/>This coincides with teaching tips my sister (who is a teacher, as is most of my family, and priests, and people in jail, we are Spartans after all... but that's another story) taught me. She said, for every 1 piece of information you teach, have the student do something. Think of it as "learn" then "play", "listen" then... "not do" but... "experiment". <br/><br/>It's changed how I run games.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus" title="Dionysus"><img alt="Dionysus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/694/n0ANCVBURZLRD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus">Dionysus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359531/#Comment_359531" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-14T09:48:51+00:00" title="February 14, 2012  9:48AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love this idea. <br/>Basically some kind of introductory wet of scenes which will run you through the various mechanics of the game, where there isn't a horrible cost if you fuck up.<br/><br/>Define try some food for thought - also would be good for setting theme/mood for a game session as well!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_359560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359560/#Comment_359560" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-14T10:56:33+00:00" title="February 14, 2012 10:56AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I could see a prison escape with a map (that would force linearity of encounters but also ensure that they met each of the challenges).  Consider: When you reach the gate, you see on the other side is a guard you quite well, explain how he is related to you through blood or marriage.  Somewhere else: As you turn a corner, you see a lone guard, tell us the worst thing he did to torment you.  Somewhere else: You come to a vertical shaft and see a basket big enough for a man dangling a bit above you, what do you do? Toward the end: You emerge from the dungeon only to find that you are in the middle of nowhere, where do you want to go?<br/><br/>A series of prompts like this could encourage people to take specific fictional actions that map onto the basic and special moves.<br/><br/>Elsewhere, I suggested writing each move on a card and sliding them across to the players, one at a time, as they come up in play.

We were drafted into the millitary and went through basic training and special forces (world war 1 variety) training, which involved several mock combats with paint sticks and blanks, which we took rather seriously. Wasn't a dungeon, but the game didn't have dungeons. Open ended combat problems were the closest analogy. 'Course then we were put in a trench and shelled for 13 hours straight and most of the people we trained with got shot. Didn't prepare us for that. But later, our understanding of murdering techniques and paranoia kept us alive. More importantly, it helped with character development. We got to know and disdain one another before cooperation-or-death.<br/><br/>I don't think that you can necessarily design an introductory rp segment using the same techniques as megaman uses, though. The parameters of the game are usually strongly different to the point that they need to be taught differently. I think a good design would combine the primary game elements (which unlike in megaman may be different from its basic operations) in a nonlinear puzzle. In some situations, a linear series of challenges makes sense but it's my suspicion that most of the time it won't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_359567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359567/#Comment_359567" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-14T11:25:23+00:00" title="February 14, 2012 11:25AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love this idea, although I've yet to see a really good implementation of it in the RPG medium.

Like when we play Dogs, I'll ask someone, "why were you chosen to be a Dog?" sometimes throwing in "by who?" and "when?" And I'll roleplay it out with them for a minute. Then I ask them to choose their Background. So I engage them, get them to give me something back, we roleplay (tapping into emotions), and then do something mechanical (choosing a Background as part of character creation). But it depends on the players. One size doesn't fit all so I'll socialize before the game starts to read what people are into (or just ask them) and adjust as needed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_359582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359582/#Comment_359582" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-14T12:10:08+00:00" title="February 14, 2012 12:10PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John, did you see the recent D&amp;D red box?

It started with a solo adventure in which you played a brave young fighter out to capture the bandit wizard Bargle.  Each section of the dungeon was designed to teach you one part of D&amp;D: the fight with the goblin teaches about rolling to hit.  The fight with the snake teaches you about hit points.  Then you encounter the cleric Aleens and she teaches you about healing (and turning undead).  Finally you face the wizard and learn about spells and saving throws.  Only after you finish this solo adventure do you build your character (and the first regular adventure in the book is about getting revenge on Bargle for his acts in the solo adventure).<br/><br/>The Bargle revenge adventure also acts as a GM tutorial.  The introductory parts provide a lot of guidance to a novice GM ("Here are four possible tactics for fighting the kobolds, and here's how to roleplay a kobold cptive")  Then as you enter the dungeon proper, you get detailed, interesting dungeon stuff and finally on the second level you're asked to create your own encounters and such.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_359601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359601/#Comment_359601" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-14T12:50:04+00:00" title="February 14, 2012 12:50PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am going to be trying something along these lines for out Wed EPT hack of DW. <br/><br/>"I would love if more games taught me how to play this way.

The entire level based system is less about your character advancing and more about the <i>players</i> advancing.  (This is especially true in more recent editions.)  You're a first level wizard, with a tiny handful of spells.  You learn how to use those spells most effectively to help your party.  After a while, you've started to get a hang for when Sleep is the spell needed and when Expeditious Retreat is the right answer.  That's when you go up to second level.  All of a sudden, you have more choices.  Now you can prepare more spells each day.  Awesome.  Can you figure out a good combo of two spells that you're already familiar with?  And after you master that handful of spells, you go up to third level and start getting <i>2nd level</i> spells.  So you have a whole new pile of tactical choices to make. <br/><br/>And this is all mediated over several combat and exploration phases, so you get to test out your abilities in a host of circumstances.  And as you go up in level, you start encountering more and more creatures with weird special abilities... your "immune to fire" or what have you.  These special abilities throw in more tactical and strategic complications for you to deal with as you grow in capabilities and in your understanding of the rules set.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359614/#Comment_359614" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-14T13:11:53+00:00" title="February 14, 2012  1:11PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If someone wants to do this for DW and make it available I will happily provide layout for it and post it to the DW site, fully credited to the author of course.

A session follows a loose script like this:<br/><br/>Character creation<br/>(5 min break)<br/>Intro combat<br/>Interaction with mortals<br/>(5 min break)<br/>Fighting a god<br/><br/>Each step has it's own script, which doesn't involve planning what is happening in the story, just the rules that will be engaged and when.  The script works well for me and I can adhere to it very closely since the dice are about the feel of the actions, not the type of actions themselves.<br/><br/>There is one moment I sometimes have to force, during the interaction with mortals step.  There are two options and players usually focus on one of them, but since I'm demonstrating the game, if no one looks like they're leaning towards the less used option (which becomes more important during long term play) I ask someone if they're willing to be the guinea pig, but still give them the reward that they really want.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
