(I have to remember to write up a full account of it sometime...) The game had some good moments, but there were a lot of times when we felt like we were struggling with the "creativity" required by the game. (Both my husband and one of my friends put it that way -- they both said that they "don't feel very creative" and that was a problem.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSome things we had trouble with:<br/>\n- Coming up with character concepts<br/>\n- Coming up with character goals/motivations<br/>\n- Framing scenes<br/>\n- Pacing<br/>\n- Playing the character roles%0                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece" title="Brennen Reece"><img alt="Brennen Reece" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece">Brennen Reece</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171516/#Comment_171516" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-26T12:34:26+00:00" title="September 26, 2008 12:34PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You guys should read <a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/1436677" rel="nofollow">"Play Unsafe"</a> by our very own Graham Walmsley.<br/><br/>Don't try so hard to be creative.

Play close to home.  Build characters based on things that are important to you. <br/><br/>For example, I'm an only child and have often wondered what siblings are like.  So I build characters with siblings.  I also have a bit of a "white knight" complex when it comes to women so I build characters who feel responsible for the woman their life.  Then I mix and match.  It is not uncommon for me to play characters with sisters, for example.<br/><br/>If I can target this "close to home" material at another player that's even better.  So for example if I'm playing one of my "white knight" characters I will come up with a reason as to why he feels like he should be protecting one of the women characters.  It doesn't matter what the other play thinks of this setup because however that player chooses to react will create drama.  Anything from "Oooo... my hero!" to "fuck you jerk, I can take care of myself." works just great.<br/><br/>If targeting another player doesn't work or make sense then it's a good idea to figure out how whatever issues you've loaded into the character manifest externally.  "Must always be right" is a good one as it externalizes as constantly trying to take control and undermine other people's suggestions.<br/><br/>Then Scenes and Conflicts become about stressing these interactions.  Have the big monster attack the "fiercely independent woman" while "Mr. White Knight" is watching and "Must Always Be Right" dude is shouting orders.

Like, you need to have the feeling of "I can't wait to see how these suckers are going to die."  If you're not inspired by the stuff you've made, that's hard.  Honestly, though, if your local play group is the kind of crew that has trouble with things like Primetime Adventures or other things that require a lot of player input on creative content and scene framing, maybe you should just play something else, y'know?  Or at least try to play some of the indie classics (PTA, etc.) before tackling something like Geiger.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171770/#Comment_171770" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-28T13:08:51+00:00" title="September 28, 2008  1:08PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Copy, steal, riff on ideas, images, characters, situations etc. from film, literature, theatre, music and anything else you find interesting.

For example, I played the very first Hero in Blood Red Sands playtesting. I was at a loss as to what to play, until I remembered a trope from anime.. the Bishonen Swordsman that tends to show up in a lot of anime fantasy. From that 2 dimensional character, I was able to fill him out.<br/><br/>A great place to look for and identify useful tropes would be <a href="http://tvtropes.org" rel="nofollow">http://tvtropes.org.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
