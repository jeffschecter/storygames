Almost nothing.  I hate the term Suspension of Disbelief.  I think this largely has to do with the fact that I define genres in terms of scope of conflicts and possible resolution and not in terms of "tropes" like most people.  I also have a willingness to not know what kind of story we're telling until it's been told and reflect on it.<br/><br/>So I'm likely to say in *retrospect* of a game, "Well that was all very gothic" or "How noirish."<br/><br/>Otherwise I tend to setup a game in terms of conflicts, emotions and a little dash of atmosphere.  So, I guess perhaps I get annoyed when things fall out of those established ranges but that's much more about me connecting with other players on a emotional level than not "buying" something that happens in the fiction.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_107571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107571/#Comment_107571" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-09T14:42:32+00:00" title="November  9, 2007  2:42PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Jesse said. I don't find that suspension of disbelief, <i>per se</i>, is much of an issue for me. Sometimes I will start at something particularly jarring (strange ideas about human behavior, emotions, and relationships, especially - if I can't map the behavior of a human being to my understanding of how human beings behave, it bugs me), but I tend to just incorporate it and move on. The game is about the relationships and the conflicts, not the details.<br/><br/>However, a clash of visions among players can be really frustrating - if one person thinks we're playing a swashbuckly adventury sort of game, and another is busily drawing up detailed plans and empire-building, that's a pain. Not because of SoD, but because I don't know what I'm <i>supposed</i> to believe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_107579">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107579/#Comment_107579" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-09T15:28:23+00:00" title="November  9, 2007  3:28PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Playing a role-playing game breaks my suspension of disbelief.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_107587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Temple" title="Temple"><img alt="Temple" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b340/kreutzer/ubt.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Temple">Temple</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107587/#Comment_107587" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-09T16:07:22+00:00" title="November  9, 2007  4:07PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My dispeblief is permanently suspended from active duty.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_107588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107588/#Comment_107588" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-09T16:09:48+00:00" title="November  9, 2007  4:09PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Attacking the concept of suspension of disbelief is counter-productive to this thread.

But there are times when you're playing the game when you're more "into it" than others.  Sometimes things happen that pull you out of it in the same way they would if you were watching a movie.<br/><br/>I think that in addition to things that happen "in-game" there are things you do during a tabletop game will also break your suspension of disbelief.

Also, there are times where I'm like, "WTF, that TOTALLY wouldn't happen that way". Then I make a conscious decision:<br/><br/>* If the GM looks like he can "fix his description"or change the encounter in minor ways by adopting a suggestion, and the suggestion wouldn't disrupt anything, then I make the suggestion:<br/><br/>"Actually, wouldn't the pirates keep two guards or so outside, as they'd be on the lookout for us since they know we're on their trail?"<br/><br/>* If it looks like my suggestion that would re-engage that Belief Engine would disrupt the game, or is just untenable for the way things are going, then I *believe extra hard* (no shit) and just let go, thinking, "Yeah, it just happened that way. The pirates didn't consider posting guards because they were probably distracted or something".<br/><br/>There's one woman in my group who has to take characters with one of the following traits or "drawbacks" every time she plays:<br/>* Young<br/>* Foolhardy<br/>* Brash<br/>* Man of Action<br/>(or the equivalent)<br/><br/>Otherwise, she picks apart an adventure. "I'm a 4th level mage, but why in God's name would I descend into this cavern when I know kobolds are there?  I would rather alert the guards, and come back with a company of at least 50 men, or perhaps just hang back and let them take care of things. Treasure? I can't spend treasure if I'm dead!" etc.  CoC games, particularly: "Why would I explore this cursed house? I'm just a reporter!"<br/><br/>But the funny thing is, if she knowingly chooses one of the above traits (and she often does), she will make a comment like "If I wasn't foolhardy I'd totally not go down there with just 4 people. But since I am, I'm totally charging ahead. To the caverns!"<br/><br/>Note, that this is interesting: That same player, when we play PTA, that alone is justification enough for all suspension of her disbelief. She *thinks* in TV terms, having been suckling on Buffy, Angel, Firefly, ER, etc etc for years. So even if she is not "foolhearty", and I introduce a situation where a normal sane person would never take a plunge (ex: Chasing after a killer without first contacting the police, the FBI, the CIA, and 10 mercenaries), she'll totally say, "Oh, this is totally the scene where I single handedly run after the killer by myself". She treats everything as an archetypal scene from a show or movie (or what a Movie Person or TV Person would do), and even though it sounds a little weird when she says it, that's her totally wearing that cloak of suspension of disbelief.<br/><br/>So for her, thinking of the RPG as a modern TV serialized show helps her totally suspend her disbelief.  Since some great PTA experiences, I've actualyl found myself even running traditional games more like TV shows with that group (calling scenes, etc).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_107757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107757/#Comment_107757" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-11T00:27:15+00:00" title="November 11, 2007 12:27AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Uh.</p>\n<p>I find the term 'suspension of disbelief' to be totally misdirective; at <em>best</em> it is describing a process without considering cause or effect, which seems very odd indeed.

It was a con game and the group woke up to find themselves and the city had been teleported into a strange afterlife. There was no  world outside the sphere the city occupied. Anyway, some other folks had woken up earlier and this guy was busy establishing military and political control (he called it order and discipline) and started giving us orders and a fight broke out between his group and a group of "terrorists" that were opposing him. <br/><br/>I know we were "supposed" to side with the order and discipline guy and get into a fight with the "terrorists." But I kept thinking about how this wasn't my fight and "who's this dictator dude that I should follow him? Maybe the terrorists are actually just trying to depose a mad despot." The party seemed to have the same thought and we spent the rest of the four hours exploring and finding a way out of the city. No adventure, just walking around and looking at stuff and going "Oooh. weird." <br/><br/>In retrospect, had I just decided my character was afraid of thinking for himself and just wanted someone to tell him what to do, I could have blindly followed Pappa Doc into a rip-roaring four hours. It wouldn't have been perfect, but it would have been better than it ended up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_107829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107829/#Comment_107829" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-11T17:39:18+00:00" title="November 11, 2007  5:39PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>I'm a 4th level mage, but why in God's name would I descend into this cavern when I know kobolds are there?</blockquote>\nDon't tell her about the kobolds until its too late!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_107835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107835/#Comment_107835" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-11T18:51:48+00:00" title="November 11, 2007  6:51PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There was a D&amp;D game I sat in on recently. Was a group I sometimes play with, like once every other month, whenever I drive more than 2 hours to see them. They were die-hard D&amp;D 3.5 players. The game master is setting up this scenario where my guy joins up with this group to go hunt a dragon that has been plaguing the countryside. My character, being of a more philisophical and academic bent (basically a philosopher warrior) starts asking questions about the dragon, its past actions, when it has attacked. Every answer I get from the game master seems to indicate the beast only attacks after people head into its territory, so without thinking I say in character "Why don't we just leave the dragon alone? Put up signs to warn people away. Why are we going to kill something just for defending its home? I thought we were heroes."<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could have heard a pin drop. Everyone just stared at me like I'd killed a small puppy in front of them, the GM included. I quickly said "I mean... of course we should kill it. Let's go."<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game continued, but I just wasn't into it after that.<br/>\n<br/>\nME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_107857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Merten" title="Merten"><img alt="Merten" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://merten.kapsi.fi/pics/fiat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Merten">Merten</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107857/#Comment_107857" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-11T23:53:49+00:00" title="November 11, 2007 11:53PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Otherwise, she picks apart an adventure.

My Suspension of Disbelief, or the feeling of being there, suffers (might not break, depends on the occasion) if I'm required to make decisions that just don't make sense from the perspective of character. Or if another character, npc, or the world in general continuously acts in non-consistent way - sudden weirdness works just fine. If, for example, the characters find themselves herded towards something without a reason (which might not be apparent to them), it tends to wreak havoc to SoD, though it might not do it instantly.<br/><br/>Likewise, an agreement about the theme of the session does miracles. If we agree that the style of the game is akin to a fast-paced, no-holds-barred, head-first tv-show, the problem is reversed. Not going in head-first breaks the SoD.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/schlafmanko" title="schlafmanko"><img alt="schlafmanko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/schlafmanko">schlafmanko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108012/#Comment_108012" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-12T17:52:27+00:00" title="November 12, 2007  5:52PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What breaks my suspension of disbelief depends in large part on how much I trust the GM or the player who's doing something anomalous.

In Harn, this same scenario is patently absurd. <br/><br/>In Champions, for instance, donning bright colored spandex and apprehending villainous evil-doers by way of flexing your own superhuman muscles is the order of the day. In The 23rd Letter, this same scenario is utterly laughable. <br/><br/>For me, suspension of disbelief seems to get shattered when elements that are completely at odds with the established tenets of a given setting, genre, or style of play get introduced into said setting, genre, or style of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone" title="Quintin Stone"><img alt="Quintin Stone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://rps.net/QS/Images/pipboy-32x32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone">Quintin Stone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108401/#Comment_108401" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-15T11:07:15+00:00" title="November 15, 2007 11:07AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very little breaks my suspension of disbelief.
