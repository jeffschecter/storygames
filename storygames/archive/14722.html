I think one player had his characters e-mail data back and forth, but for the most part if player A's lunar character needed something from Earth, they directed their request to player B's terrestrial character, and vice versa.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_334830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334830/#Comment_334830" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-16T17:48:06+00:00" title="July 16, 2011  5:48PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the point of having a team is to have meaningful conflict between team members.  Generally it is uninteresting to both create and resolve conflict between your own characters.  I think a game like that could work if you have mechanisms to rotate who controlled which characters and NPCs.  Otherwise, you might as well play totally tactical game like Descent: Journeys in the Dark.  You could probably design a good 1-shot game wherein one player plays a sniper and the other player plays the sniper's spotter with both alternating playing the target and describing what the other sees.  It would be really intimate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334848/#Comment_334848" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-16T19:45:33+00:00" title="July 16, 2011  7:45PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: k.graz</cite>After re-reading some military sci-fi classics (Heinlein's "Starship Troopers," Philip K.

Are you going to hit that perfect sweet spot of incomplete information and first person role playing experience?  Probably not.  But your are going to get to play more roles, be exposed to a greater variety of encounters, and have a lot more spot light time than if you were one voice in a group.  I'd say go for it, less bickering, less meta-gaming, more game play.  Sounds like win + win + win = WIN.  I'd love to have a GM that would run that type of game for me. <br/>--<br/>TAZ                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_334851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334851/#Comment_334851" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-16T20:06:11+00:00" title="July 16, 2011  8:06PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 16, 2011 8:06PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, we do this sometimes.

Worked pretty well, but the players liked their Sgts more than draftees. I think this was because I was worried about the opposite happening and overcompensated and also playing an experienced soldier was more fun than a budding superhero.

In part, we were driven to it by the rules that required that many of the PCs be on the injured reserve list.  Also, having multiple PCs allowed for a broad range of skills and equipment.  In effect, it wound up being troupe style play where the focus of the campaign was on the unit as a whole in their efforts to survive and establish a future for themselves.  <br/><br/>I've long wanted to try out troupe style play for a Star Trek campaign.  Each player would have two characters:  an officer and an away team member.  The players would bid or negotiate for rank and seniority in the groups, with one character being the most senior in one group and the the other character the most junior in the second.  For instance, the player of the captain would have the most junior character on the away team, and the commander of the away team would have the most junior officer (i.e. helm, communications, navigation, etc.).  The other personnel on the ship (i.e. grogs) would be run by the party as a whole.  As in Ars Magica, the focus of the campaign would be on the ship itself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_334888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AlexMayo" title="AlexMayo"><img alt="AlexMayo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AlexMayo">AlexMayo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334888/#Comment_334888" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-17T06:50:46+00:00" title="July 17, 2011  6:50AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Never done it, but Arc Dream's <b><i>Godlike</i></b> describes TOG groups being upwards of 10 members per team - guess the players could all take control of multiple TOG members - and would make sense given the high lethality of the system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skade" title="skade"><img alt="skade" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skade">skade</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334892/#Comment_334892" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-17T07:02:46+00:00" title="July 17, 2011  7:02AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've done it several times, with mixed results.  My first Ars Magica story arc I had the players all make mages and custos, and the story was done from both the perspective of the mages themselves and the servants.  It was a neat conceit for a time, but the players obviously prefered the mages.  When we first started playing Pathfinder (beta rules in Rise of the Runelords) I was not running the game for once, and was asked to play two characters so that the group would be four, for balace issues.  I played a wizard and cleric, one male, one female, totally different perspectives and attitudes, gave one an accent and it worked out really well.  The only complaint was from the DM who felt I coordinated my charcters actions too often, to which I replied we should all be coordinating.  In highly tactical games I think it works well, in games that require siginificantly more time speaking in character or intensive long roleplay I think it becomes more difficult to switch between two characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/k.graz" title="k.graz"><img alt="k.graz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/049/nXPWPVIT01SE7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/k.graz">k.graz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335052/#Comment_335052" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-18T08:58:18+00:00" title="July 18, 2011  8:58AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks all!
