At the end of the poker game, the ship will be totally submerged, and only the Devil can save you. The Devil is (of course) the bank. <br/><br/>Instead of cash, you're betting pieces of your soul. The object of the game is to gather more pieces of your opponents souls, so that you can get off the boat with the Devil's help without losing your own soul. You each have ten chips. Make sure you can identify each player's chips. The Devil (bank) only mediates, and makes sure that each scene has a start and a finish. <br/><br/>When it's your turn: <br/>- Place a bet: Play out one of your character's childhood memories. Your memories are fond, but there is always a hint of the Devil's influence. DARKNESS. <br/>- Fold: Play out a memory from your character's adult life - a happy moment that led to your character's sins. <br/>- Hold: Play out a short scene that includes your own character as well as one - two of the other characters. This is where your sins and your connections become apparent. Do you love each other, do you hate each other, have you been deceitful and evil? <br/>- Going all in marks the end of your character's story: Play out a scene in the life of the character that could have happened if you'd been a more righteous man. <br/><br/>The winner in the end is the person with the most chips. If you have no chips, you're going down with the ship, and then on to Hell. Of course, there are no real winners in a game with the Devil, and it'll be a brilliant player who wins back all his/her own chips and those of the opponents. In other words, you might live, but you'll have lost parts of your soul. <br/><br/>Drink wine whilst playing, if anything, or some other dark liquid that hints of DARK and HORROR and SCARY. <br/>Don't eat candy or anything sweet. There's no sweetness when the Devil is involved.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pete" title="Pete"><img alt="Pete" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pete">Pete</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389780/#Comment_389780" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-11T04:30:50+00:00" title="September 11, 2012  4:30AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Poorly Translated Indian Comic</b> is a role-playing poem for 3-5 players.

The other players will assume the role of Commentators.<br/><br/>Write down the following sentences on the index cards, one sentence on each card:<br/><br/>* Impressionistic, Pastel, Sounds<br/>* Clinical Reportage, Black and White, Sights<br/>* Emotional, Fast, Touch<br/>* Bullet Time, Slow Mo, Exacting Detail, Smells<br/><br/>Place the cards face up in front of The Shooter With A Grim And Firm Purpose.<br/><br/>The role of The Shooter With A Grim And Firm Purpose is to just describe their intent: "I do this," "I do that," "I walk there," "I shoot at...," and so forth.<br/><br/>The Commentators take it in turns to describing the result of The Shooter With A Grim And Firm Purpose's intent. Yeah, the Commentators are sorta like passive GMs.<br/><br/>When The Shooter With A Grim And Firm Purpose states their intent, they will also pick one of the cards and slide it over to the Commentator next in line to narrate. The Commentator will then describe the result of The Shooter With A Grim And Firm Purpose in the style indicated on the card. Once the result has been described, the Commentator slides the card back towards The Shooter With A Grim And Firm Purpose. The Shooter With A Grim And Firm Purpose then states their next intent... play cycles in a back and forth style like that.<br/><br/>To start the game, the player of The Shooter With A Grim And Firm Purpose reads the following out loud.<br/><br/><i>"The waters of the lake have stained my trousers of my police uniform wet up to the knees. The sun shines brightly through the woods. Gun metal feels cool to my touch. The air is choked with the smell of summer. Ah! Here they come to greet me. They think I am here to protect them. The island is Utoya. My name is Anders Breivik. I raise my pistol, take aim at its head, and pull the trigger."</i><br/><br/>The intent of The Shooter With A Grim And Firm Purpose is to stalk and murder the folk on this island. Crack on.<br/><br/>The game finishes when the Commentators have collectively described the killing of 32 folk.

Make sure it's from your community.<br/><br/>Write your dog's name on the top of the card. Number some lines on the card from 1 to 6. Using the information on the poster or post, write down 6 traits about the dog and its behavior. Mark each trait as either "D" for "domesticated" or "dog", or as "WF" for "wild &amp; free" or "wolf." Most likely, you'll have more "D" traits than "WF" traits to start.<br/><br/>Take turns. When it's your turn, you narrate what might have happened to your dog, starting with them at home and showing how they got out. The other players play the real world as you collectively imagine it. <br/><br/>When you encounter a thing and aren't sure how your dog feels about it or will react to it, roll a die and consult the appropriate trait, narrating the dog acting in that manner. If the interaction makes the dog feel more comfortable and relaxed, cool. But if it makes them more upset, replace one of your "D" traits with a new "WF" trait as the panic and anxiety sets in. However it goes, switch to the other player after you resolve the roll.<br/><br/>The lost dogs can potentially encounter each other during the game. When they do, both players roll.<br/><br/>After each player has several turns, make one final roll to determine whether the dog goes home or allows itself to be recovered (if you roll a "D" trait) or, alternately, never returns home (if you roll a "WF" trait). In the latter case, never describe what actually happens to the dog, aside from noting that they remained wild and free.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389803/#Comment_389803" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-11T10:37:45+00:00" title="September 11, 2012 10:37AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2012 10:38AM by Arpie.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            11:27 AM:<br/><br/>Each player needs three index cards.

The lazy susan is spun, and the wind blows out a candle, preferably only one, but if more are blown out, then, oh well.<br/><br/>Players look at the remaining lit candles for names. Players with blown out candles have died, and become the darkness. Feel free to describe their disappearances or deaths. As darkness players, they taunt the player in the next round of actions.<br/><br/>Play continues until all candles have been blown out. Noone survives.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_389959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389959/#Comment_389959" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-12T15:36:55+00:00" title="September 12, 2012  3:36PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Really good, this thread, thanks to you and your games!

You each are wanted gunmen in the old west, facing each other down in the middle of a dirty street.<br/><br/>Someone slighted the other, or maybe they want to turn the other in for the bounty on their head. That's all decided as you take turns slinging insults and taunts at each other. Each turn you take slinging spit, you can pick up one of the dice in front of you with your shootin' hand, and hold it in your clenched fist. You can't use your other hand AT ALL. The more dice you can get into your hand, the better it is for you.<br/><br/>As soon as someone drops one of their dice, BANG they fire off a shot at the other. If it's on purpose, they better be damned confident. If it was an accident...they should'a been more careful, butterfingers.<br/><br/>If the die comes up a 6, the opponent is hit and dies. Otherwise, the other gunman can fire off a shot, back and forth until someone either gets a 6, or one of them runs out of dice.<br/><br/>If you accidentally drop two or more dice at once, you misfire, and count the lowest result.

Best strategy is to pick up one die first, let the other player pick one, and then you pick up and drop one.  You have 1/6 chance of immediately winning, they have a 1/6 chance of countering (technically less than 1/6 since they have to survive first), and then you have a 100% chance of stabbing them.  The fix (which you may just have run out of time to explain) is that you'd have to ensure a simultaneous 'draw' of the dice.  Perhaps something like a count down that is repeated, "1..2..Draw..."  Done that way, the last die will be the one in the hand of shooter that did not drop.<br/>--<br/>TAZ                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389988/#Comment_389988" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-12T21:07:57+00:00" title="September 12, 2012  9:07PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I didn't really think it through.

You're not sure what and you're not sure why.<br/><br/>You start with 9 white six-sided dice in the middle of the table.  3 players and a GM.  You'll need extra black six-sided dice (or a contrasting color from the other dice)<br/><br/>As it chases you, you get to do things to try and get away.  Maybe you remember which way town is, or you think you have something useful in your backpack.  Narrate what you think will be helpful to you and the group.  Then choose how many dice to roll, you can pick up 1, 2 or 3.<br/><br/>If you roll a 4, 5 or 6 on one or more of the dice, you succeed.  Narrate what this success means and how it'll help you escape.  You also keep one white die in front of you.  The rest are discarded for now.<br/><br/>If you roll a 1, 2 or 3, something bad happens.  You catch a glimpse of whatever is chasing you, you see the remains of one of it's previous prey, your path is blocked, etc.  All the dice you roll are discarded.<br/><br/>For both results, the GM gets black dice equal to the number of white dice discarded.<br/><br/>Once every player has described an action and rolled the dice once each, the GM can describe whatever it is that is chasing you, not in complete detail though, as the monster attacks someone.  The GM rolls up to 3 of their dice, if any come up a 5 or 6, they can kill one player.  They discard down to one black die regardless of the result.<br/><br/>The players now add 6 white dice to the middle of the table and take turns narrating again.<br/><br/>At the end of the GM phase, he keeps 2 black dice.<br/><br/>At the end of the third GM phase, any surviving players may roll any kept white dice.  If they get a 4, 5 or 6, they can narrate how they escape to safety.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rgrassi" title="rgrassi"><img alt="rgrassi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rgrassi">rgrassi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389992/#Comment_389992" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-12T23:50:26+00:00" title="September 12, 2012 11:50PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            TomasHVM, why not put together these games into a file and store somewhere with the title "Some little dark roleplaying games"?<br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_389994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389994/#Comment_389994" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-13T00:11:25+00:00" title="September 13, 2012 12:11AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, I will not.

What matters is the light has vanished and the dark is coming for your people.<br/>You and your companions are choosen to brave the dark and bring back the light to the world.<br/>This will require a great sacrifice.

Each player has three candles in front of him or her. <br/>At the beginning two of each hero's candles are burning.<br/>All three of the GMs are burning.<br/>The candles are the heros "lifepoints" and "attributes"<br/>You need dark and light dice.<br/>For a challenge roll a light dice for each canlde burning in front of your hero and a dark dice for each one extinguished.

They should be hidden and shrouded but their hungers can easily distract them, but distraction should come with a scarifice.

It might be at the beach, the amusement park, in a ghost town, or the depths of space. Each player at the table assumes the role of some hapless victim trapped in the agreed upon setting. <br/><br/>This game requires a standard deck of playing cards. The story uses the conventions of Hearts for game play, however scoring and a few details are handled differently.<br/><br/>Depending on how many players are at the table, the number of cards dealt varies: 3 players get 17 cards, four players get 13 cards, five players get 10 cards, six players get 8 cards, and for seven players they only get 7 cards.<br/><br/>After the cards are dealt, the dealer begins the game with the phrase, "By the prickings of my thumbs, something wicked this way comes."  The player to the left then plays their first card. But, each time a card is played the player has to add to the story depending on the suite of the card played.<br/><br/>Diamonds - Add something to the setting that aids the player: weapons, a first aid kits, a safe place to hide, a working cell phone, etc.<br/>Clubs - Add something to the setting that hinders the player: a locked gate, the power fails, the weather takes a turn for the worse, etc.<br/>Hearts - Describe how the player is wounded, demoralized, or loses an important  piece of equipment.<br/>Spades - Add something wicked: a monsterous detail, a terrible scene, something that adds madness and fear.<br/><br/>Unlike Hearts, you don't keep score with points but with the number of tricks (hands) that you win. After all the cards have been played, the next player 'spends' one trick to describe a detail in the final scene. If you don't have a trick, you're dependent on the other players to save you. Tricks can be spent on your escape plan, attempting to defeat the monster(s), or revealing those dark secrets you've been working on for the whole game. Go around the table crafting the final scene using those tricks one at a time. The one exception is the trick that contains the Queen of Spades, the Black Lady, Death. If you have more than one trick left, save this for last since your character tragically does not make it in the end. <br/>--<br/>TAZ<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390147/#Comment_390147" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-13T18:30:48+00:00" title="September 13, 2012  6:30PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So... who won?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390157">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390157/#Comment_390157" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-13T19:25:57+00:00" title="September 13, 2012  7:25PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 13, 2012 7:38PM by zircher.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You'll have to play to find out.

See, when I saw the word 'dark', I did'nt take it literally, unlike so many in the aforementioned thread. I thought, what's 'dark' to me? And lo, a single word emerged: privation. The core conceit being that resources are scarce, and doing anything -- anything at all -- taxes what little you have in reserve. The kind of sheer, inexorable survival where staying in the green means having to put a bullet in your friend.<br/><br/>Naturally, the brain went with a post-apocalyptic tableau, but the musings below should fit just about any situation with high risks and hard to come by resources. Anyway, here goes...<br/><br/>Reserve is key.<br/><br/>Commit Reserve to get what you want. Roll dice equal to that commitment. Win or lose, committed Reserve is forfeit.<br/><br/>Use d6s, 4 or higher is advantage, 1s return to your pool, the most advantage wins and ties exhaust both parties to neither's advantage (retries require the situation to change in some way before rolling).<br/><br/>The world is perilous and resources are scarce. What will you sacrifice to stay alive?<br/><br/>Steel is skill, strength and ammo.<br/>Heart is fellowship, empathy and intuition.<br/>Past is learning, forethought and memory.<br/><br/>Each pool starts at 6. Acting requires committing Reserve from the appropriate pool. If nothing significant is at stake, spend 1 Reserve and narrate the outcome. When a pool is depleted, you can no longer act accordingly; you're injured, exhausted, out of ammo, etc. When all pools are depleted and nobody has your back, you die.<br/><br/>You can commit Reserve singly or jointly. Committing means acting. To help out, make sure you have Reserve to commit from the appropriate pool and explain how you contribute to the effort.<br/><br/>To replenish Reserve, you must secure shelter, food, water, magazines, ammunition and so on. To do so, name the size of the cache you are after, 1 through 3. This is the number of dice's worth of Reserve therein.<br/><br/>1 is a small cache: a single survivor, a looted store, a place to rest.<br/>2 is a moderate cache: a small group, food supplies, a place to sleep.<br/>3 is a large cache: a gang or small community, an abundant food supply, a place to recuperate.<br/><br/>Double this number to give the GM a budget for whatever stands in your way. This budget is committed like Reserve and functions much the same way. 1s are retained and may be committed anew. The cache is only disbursed when the GM has nothing more to commit; introduce new challenges if need be.<br/><br/>Once disbursed, the cache replenishes any pool appropriate to the fiction; a hardware store is unlikely to replenish Heart, but definitely Past.<br/><br/>Manipulation and disagreements pertaining to the disbursal of cache Reserve is...really just par for the course. No honour among thieves. All that.<br/><br/># # #<br/><br/>Needs a bit of framing and direction-pondering (besides the frantic rush for resources), methinks. Maybe some kind of bargain/dirty deal mechanic, too.</blockquote>\nCrossed posted with permission.<br/>--<br/>TAZ                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_390620">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390620/#Comment_390620" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-18T01:03:20+00:00" title="September 18, 2012  1:03AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's the skeleton of a dystopian fable.

Doing something to challenge the players this time ...<br/><br/><b>The Stare</b><br/>- a story-game for 4-5 players<br/><br/>You start by voting; which one of you has the less willpower? The one voted to be weakest is the one who gets to start the story. He/she will narrate ...<br/>- what kind of person she is telling the story of (name, age, gender, occupation, and/or other details)<br/>- where that individual live<br/>- what is happening to him/her<br/><br/>You may narrate anything about your person, but ...<br/>- as the person you talk about meets another person, any other player can take up the mantle of this person, and try to outstare you. <br/><br/>If you keep your calm, and make him turn away, your person will dominate the other one, and you may keep narrating. You may narrate anything about the relationship between your person and a person he/she dominates. <br/><br/>You keep narrating until you meet a third person, any player not assigned a person may take up the mantle of this one, and try to outstare you. If you win, you narrate, until you meet a fourth person ... (etc).<br/>BUT; if the other player wins the staring contest, he gets to take over the role of storyteller. <br/><br/>His person will dominate your person, so he may narrate anything about your relationship, and of course; send the story in other directions too, leaving your person behind. Now the story will all be about his person, and what happens to him/her.<br/><br/>This is how it goes, until all of you have a person to tell the story of. However; you may still introduce new persons to the story, and those are free for all too; any other players may take up the mantle and try to outstare you. When all players have two persons, they can start to take third too, and so forth ...<br/><br/>When a player has taken up the mantle of a second person, his first person may be killed in the narrative. Anyone bringing your first person into the tale, and succeeding in outstaring you, may kill your first person. You must, of course, try to outstare them, so you may narrate how you escape death. You may turn the tables too, and try to murder the first person of the other player. This is done, however, in a new staring contest.<br/><br/>The story ends when only one person is alive, of the first persons you picked to be yours. The player of that person gets to tell the tale of how he lived on, with the regrets and happy memories of an old scoundrel ...<br/><br/>Some advice;<br/>- tell effective tales; don't dwell too much on details, but be sure to include one<br/>- do scene-framing and time-jumps as you like; as long as you are the storyteller, you set the mood and pace<br/>- not all staring contests are yours to win; lower your eyes when nothing big is at stake<br/>- challenge is a good thing; even the ones loosing a challenge may grow on it<br/>- tell a tale of consequence; no person is perfect, and every conflict will change something<br/>- have fun!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390680/#Comment_390680" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-18T10:55:32+00:00" title="September 18, 2012 10:55AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 18, 2012 10:56AM by Arpie.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What I think is fascinating is how many people on this site can churn out a workable dark game in 10 minutes.

Z is the initial letter of your family name. Two of you are twins. The rest are not related. Find the names now, as normal as they can be, and note them in BIG letters on the top of your sheet.<br/><br/>Even more curious: all of you are employees of the same firm; <i>Advena Computers</i>. You make up your own title in the firm, and 2-3 words describing your core tasks (example; software, development, service). Help each other do this, and be clear about who is highest in the hierarchy. None of you are executive officers in the firm, but hierarchy is important. Note the name of the firm, your title, and the tasks on your sheet.<br/><br/>But most curious of all; you all have married partners with the same initials; M.L.Z. Husbands are all named Max Love Z. Wifes are all named Minnie Love Z. Note the name of your partner on the sheet.<br/><br/>And then you all have 8 year old twins! What a coincidence! The go to the same school, in the same class, under the same miss Gloria Beadle. But that is where the coincidences stop; they are all named differently. Make the names of your twins, and note them on the sheet. Note the name of the teacher too; miss Gloria Beadle.<br/><br/><b>&gt;</b> Game-play<br/>Now you are ready for the rules of play ...<br/><br/>Play take place with your home city as the setting. That should make it easy for you to describe locations for the scenes you frame.<br/><br/>The first scene will take place in a staff meeting at Advena Computers. You play it out, in character, as normal as you can. Be boring, unoriginal, tedious. Nothing special should happen at this meeting. The scene ends (not necessarily the meeting) when one of you cut the air with his/her hands. That is the way to end any scene, and anyone participating in a scene may end it this way. When this is done interaction stops immediately, no discussion.<br/><br/>After the first scene, you take turn framing scenes, the oldest player starting. <br/><br/>Frame a scene by saying:<br/>- who is there<br/>- where are you<br/>- what is happening<br/><br/>Be short in framing your scenes; no long stories or explanations. <br/>Do it, and dive into the interaction.<br/><br/>Each one of you should follow this sequence:<br/><b>- Home scene<br/>- Work scene<br/>- Holiday/children scene</b><br/><i>(so all of you will do a home scene, then all will do a work scene, then a holiday/children scene. And then you all start anew, with home scenes)</i><br/><br/>You may include any other character, with family or without, in your scene. You have to include your own character in any scene you frame. Any family of yours is played by players with no character in the scene. If all characters are present in a scene, any family will only be played by referring to what they say and/or do.<br/><br/>The first round of scenes (that is; until each of you have gone through the sequence once) are short, and should be dominated totally by normality. <br/><br/>From the moment the first of you start on his/her second sequence of scenes, the weird should start to seep in. Each one of you may do this in your scenes, by your own choosing. None may say anything against any elements of a scene you frame. <br/><br/>The weird will seep in, and it will be more and more challenging ...<br/><br/><b>&gt;</b> The weird<br/>- Your twins are so happy, so happy, so HAPPY!!!<br/>- Your partner is growing bored, adamantly and intrusively bored<br/>- Your boss is placing strange tasks upon you; "Please Z; make roses grow in the loo!" ... "Z; you must sing for us at the next staff-meeting!" ... "Now we need to hug, Z, all of us need to hug! There is too much anxiety in the offices! Make everyone hug!" ... etc.<br/><br/><b>&gt;</b> The weird<br/>- You have this mouth in your hand, whispering advice to you; "Don't do it!" ... "Kiss him!" ... "Pull of your trousers!"<br/>- Your ass is starting to make a fanfare each time you meet someone; "Pruh-Pruh-Pruh-PRUUUH!"<br/>- Your ears are growing, folding themselves over your eyes in some situations<br/><br/><b>&gt;</b> The weird<br/>- All noses looks like cocks to you<br/>- People have no eyes, only empty spaces, black holes into their heads ...<br/>- Why do everybody try to fly when talking to you; <i>It's impossible! You have no wings, for fucks sake!</i><br/><br/>Make up stuff as you go along, and play for as long as you like.

Make your parent proud.<br/><br/>The adult does their best to point out how horrendously the child has fucked up by doing whatever they did.  How could you be such a disappointment?  No matter what the kid says,berate them for being wrong.  SO FUCKING WRONG.

Narrate whatever the soul and others are doing, as a setting for the dialogues.<br/><br/>Whenever one of you frame a scene, the other one should be the active demon. The soul is not a slave of these demons initially. This is a story of how the demons sneak into the soul, and make it loose the things it cares about. So let the demonic influences creep into the tale little by little. Start out by looking for a way in, and then to expand your influence, from scene to scene. You tell a tale of a light soul giving in to temptation, of happiness beset by unhappy accidents, of love and reason conquered by corruption ...<br/><br/>Make it a slow and insidious process.<br/><br/>Remember that all have a capacity for evil; even you! So be a patient and powerful demon, and enjoy it!<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391620">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes" title="Snake_Eyes"><img alt="Snake_Eyes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes">Snake_Eyes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391620/#Comment_391620" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-28T04:21:48+00:00" title="September 28, 2012  4:21AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Unnatural Disaster: Acting as God<br/><br/>SET UP<br/><br/>Each player starts with 3d4 3d6 3d8 3d10 3d12 3d20 3d30; 21 dice.<br/><br/>RESOLUTION<br/><br/>Choose how many dice you want bet, each player can have different bets, minimum is 3 dice, roll them against each other.<br/><br/>If you roll the maximum number on a dice, you must pick a lower dice, or two higher dice (if you have any dice left) from your pool, and roll them as part of the resolution.<br/><br/>If you roll a 1, your opponent gets to add those dice to his unused pool immediately, they are not counted towards your roll.<br/><br/>If you rolled any multiples of the same number the \u201cAmount\u201d of dice showing the same number is called \u201cMagnitude\u201d where the number on the dice is called \u201cStrength\u201d.<br/><br/>i.e. rolling 2,3,4,5,5,5,6,6,7 gives a either a Magnitude 3 Strength 5 (by using the three 5s) or Magnitude 2 Strength 6 (using the two 6s).<br/><br/>The highest Magnitude wins, and the Strength determines the dice you \u201ccapture\u201d.<br/><br/>The winning player takes all the opponents dice that had results of less than the Strength of success.<br/><br/>i.e. if you have won with a Magnitude 2 Strength 5, you take all the losers dice that rolled 4 or less.<br/><br/>If you have two or less dice left in your pool at the end of a resolution you participated in, take one dice from each other player.<br/><br/>GAME<br/><br/>You play Immortals that create natural disasters to punish other faiths, and therefore increase loyalty within your own faith.<br/><br/>During your narrate how you divinely intervene upon the faith of another player, through a natural disaster or warfare.<br/><br/>If your faith is under the effects of a natural disaster you *may* bring any other player into the resolution.

Each sheet consisting of this:<br/>- name (our world, personal and family)<br/>- crime (must be serious; murder, rape, vicious robbery, brutal child-abuse, serious economic crime, etc.)<br/>- serving time (years)<br/>Mark the backside of each sheet with a big C, and place them in a pile, face down, shuffled.<br/><br/><b>Incidents</b><br/>Then you make another set of sheets, three each; with <i>incidents</i> taking place in the prison; that may be linked to one or more criminals. You are free to come up with any variation of believable incidents. It may be murdering another inmate, trying to break out, uproars, harming a guard, finding Jesus, doing good service in the library, taking exams, etc. Both disruptive and constructive incidents may be part of it. Discuss them, if you like. Note each incident on a sheet, mark the backside with a big I, shuffle the sheets and place them face down.<br/><br/><b>History</b><br/>Then you make yet another set of sheets, three each; with a <i>happening/situation</i> from the past of a criminal. You are free to come up with any kind of happenings in the past of a criminal; happy or sad; brutal or redeeming. It may be abuse by peers, parents on drugs, heavy drinking habits ... It may be a good family, services to the community, a wife and children waiting ... Make a good mix of negative and positive happenings; three each. Note each happening on a sheet, mark the backside with a big H, shuffle the sheets and place them face down.<br/><br/><b>The jury</b><br/>You, the players, are members of a <i>jury</i> of respected citizens. As a freely elected jury it is your job to decide wether a serious criminal is to be set free and helped return to normal life after serving his/her time, or if he/she will be put to death. <br/><br/><i>The Life &amp; Death Act</i> of 2021 is built upon the fact that serious criminals have a habit of repeating their crimes, so society has a right to evaluate them at the end of a sentence, to see if there is any hope of them becoming "respected citizens". This shall be done by freely elected "respected citizens" who constitutes a jury with power to end the life of the criminal, or reestablish him/her to society. They do this jointly, and any decision must be unanimous. <br/><br/><b>Playing the game</b><br/>You start the game by one of the players drawing a criminal. Read it to the others, and place it face up on the table before you.<br/><br/>As you draw the criminal, you take the role of that criminal, standing before the jury begging for your life. You rise now, and stand before the table, as the criminal will do before his jury. You will stand there for the whole interview that decides your fate ...<br/><br/>The rest of the players are your jury; the citizens that hold your life in their hands. They may ask you any questions, about your past, your crime, your behavior in prison ... and you must answer to the best of your abilities. Will you be brought back to life, or put to death?<br/><br/>The jury will ask questions, and talk freely amongst themselves, about the reliability of this criminal, or lack of. This is a formal hearing on life and death of a human being, so it should be conducted with serious faces and sincere intentions. You have a great responsibility. <br/><br/>Any jury-member is free to invent prison-incidents and happenings that you know of from the past of the criminal. And you may draw a card from the I or H-stack at any time, to inform the interview with "facts" about the criminal, in the past or in prison. The criminal may object to any "facts" presented, and give his/her version of it. Or he may plead that he has changed ...<br/><br/>The interview ends when the jury has reached an agreement on life or death. One of them declares their verdict; life or death.<br/><br/>The criminal may say anything as he is dragged from the room. If he is set loose, being free to go, he may thank them in any way, or just leave.<br/><br/>Then another player draws a criminal, and you make a new interview. You do this to all of you have played a criminal. Then the game is over.<br/><br/><b>Have a cry!</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_392029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392029/#Comment_392029" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-01T19:45:27+00:00" title="October  1, 2012  7:45PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>After midnight</b><br/>- a role-playing game for 4-7 dark souls<br/><br/>You play this game after midnight, in the light of candles.<br/>You sit in a ring, on the floor, faces towards each other.<br/>You breathe calmly, and make a soft blowing sound each and every time you exhale.<br/>Breathe like that for some minutes, before one you start talking.<br/>Any one of you may start talking, thus beginning the tale.<br/><br/>The rest of you continue making that blowing sound while he/she talks.<br/>It is always the one to the left taking over, when someone stops talking.<br/>When you take over, the others continue breathing, and you spin the tale further.<br/>Whenever you talk, YOU are the soul we all focus on.<br/><br/>You will talk about your life, as it will be lived from next morning.<br/>The morning, and your future life, will be strange ...<br/>The world will be as you know it.<br/>Your house, the bed, the tooth-brush; every little material thing is in place.<br/>But the humans ...<br/><br/>You are you, a human.<br/>Other humans in your life will be animals.<br/>Strange spirit-animals.<br/>Some spirit-animals have names; the people you love.<br/>You may say their names to them, and that will make them react.<br/>They react as animals.<br/>They don't speak.<br/><br/>All encounters with the spirit-animals should be narrated.<br/>They have warm fur.<br/>Sharp teeth.<br/>Claws.<br/>Antlers.<br/>Roaring or lowing voices.<br/>Animals are fast and wild.<br/>Spirit animals relate to you in unexpected ways.<br/><br/>All humans will be spirit-animals; with the exception of the other players.<br/>All players in the game will be humans; themselves.<br/><br/>You may meet up.<br/>If you do, you may talk, in character.<br/>Why are you here?<br/>How did the others turn into animals?<br/>When did it happen?<br/>What do they do to you?<br/>Why?<br/><br/>Making soft blowing sounds throughout the whole game.<br/>There is no final answer to all your questions.<br/>When one of you has a turn, without talking, the tale is over.<br/>Continue breathing for some minutes.<br/>Blow softly out when exhaling.<br/>Stop blowing.<br/>Wait.<br/><br/><b>The End</b><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_392278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392278/#Comment_392278" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-03T17:01:05+00:00" title="October  3, 2012  5:01PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>ANGST</b><br/>- a game for two<br/>- play "yourself"<br/><br/>Take turns:<br/>- say what the other player should do<br/>- he stares at you, and must narrate what he does<br/>- he may <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> narrate doing the thing you say he should do<br/>- you should talk to him about it; ask him why he hasn't done it yet<br/>- he may <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> answer that question; he must say something else<br/><br/>Then you switch sides.<br/>Do that as many times as you will.<br/>Fun is not the point.

It is piloted by a slave race of women, under the control of immortal men originally from Jupiter and drawing power from the Sun itself.<br/><br/>The Moon's women can perform telepathic miracles but are slaves to the men's technology. The men, appearing to have muscular and athletic physiques have a mass of uranium, they possess technological marvels but project a magical demeanor and occult dogma, to conceal the nature of the alien slave technocracy elite world-power.<br/><br/>The Earth itself is home to a extraterrestrial serpentine race of powerful magicians. The snake-men control nearly the entire world's supply of money and therefor power through computer manipulation of the stock exchange, and carefully placed android replicants posing as world leaders they have assassinated.  The only thing keeping the Earth from spiraling into anarchy and destruction and the aftermath of nuclear and biological panocide is the angels of the moon-women.<br/><br/>You all together have been hired as celestial mercenary soldiers to join the rank of angels, and having successfully infiltrated their group must remove from power the archangels to for fill your unholy pact with the Devil.<br/><br/>DICE:<br/><br/>Roll three dice when you want something to happen, if you roll doubles it is a failure, on a triples it is a disaster or error. Otherwise the total number is how awesome you were. i.e. that many fatalities caused in an explosion, that many millions won gambling,  that many KOs in a fight.<br/><br/>END<br/><br/>When you destroy all of the archangels, and bring about the apocalypse pull up chair, have a beer, and relax!

One player starts by singling out another player's character; narrating how he/she is somehow separated from the group. That player must interject, talking over (louder) than the first before his/her character is narrated as being gruesomely killed. Having gained narrative control, the new speaker must then put another character in jeopardy.<br/><br/>The Catch:<br/>Each player holds half a birthday candle and cannot speak unless they hold it six inches from their chin (perhaps affixed to a ruler?). If a player blows out the candle, that player gets to narrate how their character dies. The louder they must interject, the more likely they will die. Tensions rise with the voices. If the candles burn low, the last one lit gives narrative closure to player holding it.<br/><br/>Possible Settings: <br/>      "Well, it's beginning to snow again. The car won't start. We've been holed up in this shack for hours and it's getting dark.  John goes outside to see if he can get a single bar on his cell phone -"<br/>     "And while I'm out there I see a figure, I think it's Lisa, go around back to the out-house -"<br/>     " It's actually Carol. I've lent her my coat and hat -"<br/>     " I don't actually have to pee. I'm sneaking out for a smoke. Carl made me so mad - why would he go down into the cellar all alone like that?"<br/><br/>    "Captain's Log: 12 11 2286. John Smith, commanding. Two days out from Gold-Dust Prime. Six more to Earth. We have the indigineous life forms secured in the med-lab and Science Officer Jones has gone down to check on them -"<br/>    "Personal Log: Science Officer Jones. One of the specimens is missing. I hesitate to point fingers but... Payload Specialist Anderson is the only other person with access. I may have to confront her.

Make sure it is totally dark. <br/><br/><b>The ring</b><br/>Light a single candle. Place it in a place where you may gather around it, in a ring. Stand in the ring around the candle, holding hands. As play progresses you will tighten the ring. It is up to you to do this at will, until you stand with your faces very close to the candle. It is nothing you talk about; just do it from time to time, during the game, so you end up standing very-very close in the end ...<br/><br/><b>The ghosts</b><br/>You are all ghosts; the sentient, but ethereal, remnants of dead people. You will all whisper in this game, as long as the game is played, from start to end. No one will leave the ring, or raise their voices.<br/><br/>There are no rules to who whispers first, or when, or how often. That will be resolved by intuition and chance amongst you. Any one of you may start to whisper, as a ghost. Any one may interrupt, and take over. Let other people have their whispers, but don't be shy to open your mouth and give the tale another twist.<br/><br/>When you whisper, you will always narrate what other ghosts are doing; floating around, seeing living people, trying to talk to them, following them, meeting other ghosts, etc. They will not steer their ghosts; they are kind of floating around in winds no one sees or feels. What they may do, is to make their own whispers, when you narrate that they do. They may whisper desperately to their former families or friends, and to each other. Other ghosts may hear them, and answer, of course, but that is all. No physical interaction of significance is possible.<br/><br/>As ghosts you are damned to live in this world for ever, without ever being able to take part in the life around you. You see everything, but have little influence on anything else but other ghosts. And the handful of you are the only ghosts present in this street. You may never leave it. <br/><br/>You may have people experience a chill, or a bleak wind against their chin, but nothing more. You are not poltergeists, that may move material objects. You are weak ghosts. You float around in the houses of you living family, or the ones that have moved into your houses after you died ... and may not communicate with them.<br/><br/><b>The dark</b><br/>You play the game until one of you, by will or accident, blows out the candle.<br/><br/>When that happens, you are all trapped in darkness. There is nothing there but you, and slowly, slooowly you come to realize that something has happened. The darkness is total, and eternal, and have bereft you of even the sight of your former world. You are not dead; you are still ghosts, but now you are trapped in the darkness with nothing but your own whispers ...<br/><br/><b>Good luck!</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403636">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes" title="Snake_Eyes"><img alt="Snake_Eyes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes">Snake_Eyes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403636/#Comment_403636" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-13T22:42:05+00:00" title="January 13, 2013 10:42PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            WE THE SIMULCRA ARE ALL THE SAME INDIVIDUAL<br/><br/>A game for 3 or more participants.<br/><br/>PLAY<br/><br/>Player <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> plays the protagonist, this could be themselves or anyone else (I recommend Bruce Willis / Nolins from The Outer Limits - Scatterday).<br/><br/>Player <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> plays the antagonist, an exact copy of the protagonist, from genetic material, appearance, voice, mannerisms and memories. For all intents and purposes they are the same person.<br/><br/>The Protagonist/ Antagonist can not be in the same space until the last scene.<br/><br/>Additional Players play the friends, co-workers and relations of the Protagonist/ Antagonist pair.

(Either it is misplaced, called to check messages, or a mis-dialed number.) The antagonist and protagonist briefly exchange conversation believing that a friend is having a joke on their behalf.<br/><br/>The protagonist and antagonist should quickly escalate threats of force or harm towards each other, convinced they are the "real one" and the other the imposter.

The default is CREEPY TRAGEDY.<br/><br/>Each player then secretly writes down one word that represents what they'd most like to see within the chosen genre.  Examples for creepy tragedy: murder, revelation, cold, abyss, abomination.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, whichever player's word best encapsulates the gist of the story is the winner.<br/><br/>Randomly assign each player one Talker.<br/><br/>Sit or stand around a central Surface that everyone can easily reach.  Turn off lights, put on blindfolds, and make sure that no one can see anyone else.<br/><br/><b>Talkers:</b><br/><br/>Talkers are hand-held objects which can be easily distinguished from each other by feel.  They act as "talking sticks" -- whoever holds each Talker gets to speak according to that Talker's province.  The provinces are:<br/>- action<br/>- sound<br/>- sight<br/>- sensation<br/>- smell &amp; taste<br/>- memory<br/><br/>If you have fewer than 6 players, omit or roll together from the bottom up.  (That is, with 5 players, either ditch Memory or include it with Smell.)<br/><br/>Time to tell a story.  The story starts like this: you cannot move, hear, see, feel, smell, or remember anything.<br/><br/><b>The rules:</b><br/><br/>No one can speak without a Talker.<br/><br/>When you have a Talker, you must speak in the second person, and only concerning your Talker's province (see Examples).<br/><br/>Whenever you finish speaking and are silent for more than a few seconds, you must put your Talker onto the Surface.<br/><br/>Whenever you have a Talker, you may discard it from play.<br/><br/>Whenever you hold a Talker for several minutes without speaking, you must discard it from play.<br/><br/>Whenever you have no Talker, you may grab a Talker from the Surface.*<br/><br/>You may not undo (or render irrelevant) anything another player has said.<br/><br/>When no one speaks for several seconds, the game is over.<br/><br/>*If you have just put down your Talker after speaking, you cannot just pick it right back up again.  Wait until the next person to speak has finished speaking and put their Talker down (as best you can guess).<br/><br/><b>Ending:</b><br/><br/>When the game ends, take off the blindfolds, turn on the lights, reveal the players' words and select a winner.<br/><br/><b>Examples:</b><br/><br/>Action: "You move forward.  You look around."<br/><br/>Sound: "You hear WHSSSSHHH the wind in the leaves."<br/><br/>Sight: "You see a man beckoning you to advance.  Off in the distance, you see a glow just over the trees."<br/><br/>Sensation: "You feel something brush against your leg."<br/><br/>Smell &amp; taste: "You catch a powerful stench of wet mud."<br/><br/>Memory: "You recall a time when you entered a place like this, with a gun, looking for someone."<br/><br/><i>Never infringe on another Talker's province!</i>  You can never say, "You see a man, who says 'Come with me' and beckons," because the "You see a man" sight and the "Come with me" sound belong to two different Talkers!<br/><br/><b>Explanation:</b><br/><br/>It doesn't matter who wins; the victory condition is just to remind players to choose and pursue a vision for the story.  In the end, it's more important to work together to craft a story that flows well.  Thus the "yes, and" rule.  <br/><br/>The intent of the game is to play around with the channels of information available, and to inexorably narrow those.  As Talkers get discarded, the story's protagonist finds themself more and more in darkness, unable to see, or hear, or act, until all players but one must passively receive the ending.  A film analogy is "closing down the iris" (of the camera), thus the title.<br/><br/>I'm also hoping that this might simultaneously get multiple players immersed in one character.  When no one can make eye contact, and one player says "You", everyone else experiences that as "Me".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_403860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403860/#Comment_403860" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-16T23:46:57+00:00" title="January 16, 2013 11:46PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David; <i>Iris Down</i> is a gem!

You are locked into the basement by your evil stepparents, who laugh with glee as they tell you that they are now going to summon \u201cthe bogeyman\u201d who will take you away one by one.  You hear them begin their Cthulhuesque chanting upstairs, as you frantically look for some way to escape.<br/><br/>Chargen: select a name, age, gender, and 1 Useful Item (pocket knife, matches, bottle of water, magnifying glass, lucky glove, security blanket, etc.)<br/><br/>Mechanic: each round, one player talks about one monster that really scared them as a child.  As they talk, that creature manifests in the basement and tries to grab that player\u2019s character. The rest of the group tries to figure out the best way to defeat, neutralize, or escape the monster.  <br/><br/>Everyone rolls 1d6, plus another die if they use their Useful Item (which is then used up; the player takes the higher result).  If anyone rolls a 1-3 as their high result, the monster grabs the targeted character and begins dragging them away into the darkness.   Keep track of how many sixes are rolled.<br/><br/>The other characters can try one at a time to free the victim, describing what they\u2019re doing and rolling a die (or 2 dice, if they give up their Useful Item): on a 5 or 6, their strategy works and they\u2019re both free, but on a 2 they switch places with the victim, and on a 1 they are both caught and dragged away.  Anyone caught by a monster who still has their Useful Item can choose to give it up to automatically escape. <br/><br/>Continue until either all the characters have been taken, or the group has rolled 12 sixes, which means the surviving kids have found a way to escape.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamofpeace" title="Dreamofpeace"><img alt="Dreamofpeace" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/262/nTKQSP3YRT3C1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamofpeace">Dreamofpeace</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411469/#Comment_411469" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-06T15:37:27+00:00" title="April  6, 2013  3:37PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 6, 2013 3:37PM by Dreamofpeace.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh I forgot to give that game a name!
