I know it needs some work, but the last one I did got some great feedback here, so I thought I'd share the new one as well. The theme for this one is Reality TV -- anything from Survivor to American Idol to Here Comes Honey Boo Boo... but all of it with a unique Fiasco twist.<br/><br/>The draft of Reality TV playset can be found here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0Ut5mF-spZydzlwTjhBVTRES0E/edit" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0Ut5mF-spZydzlwTjhBVTRES0E/edit</a><br/><br/>Any feedback will be appreciated. Right now, I am fairly satisifed with the Relationships, and I'm approaching satisfaction with the Needs and Objects. But the Locations could use some work, IMHO. I'm also not loving the opening, but I think it fits (if you get the reference). Anyway, take a look if you have a sec. Thanks!<br/><br/>If you are curious, the last one I did is now in "final" state and can be found here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0Ut5mF-spZyZ1pnTXUxRFFxOTg/edit" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0Ut5mF-spZyZ1pnTXUxRFFxOTg/edit</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
