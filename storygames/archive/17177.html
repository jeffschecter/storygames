I am sure they have been asked many times, and maybe you have some useful links.<br/><br/>1/ hitting a goblin and hitting a dragon have the same difficulty, as situational modifiers do not apply. Doesn't this create incoherence during the game? If i am good enough to best powerful monsters, shouldn't i be able to dispatch minor ones? Can the MC/GM just say you dispatch some minor enemies without rolling? (I doubt it, because by hitting them you would activate a move, forcing you to roll)<br/><br/>2/ why only one playbook/class is allowed per group? I can kind of understand it for AW, but why shouldn't I be allowed to have a human fighter and a dwarf fighter in the same party? Or a military man and a duelist, build out of different fighter options? If I am allowed a fighter and a ranger, I don't see why not two fighters with different options.<br/><br/>3/ how do you adjudicate when hirelings/allies move against enemies ? I would find it hard to be impartial and just follow the narrative without mechanical help.<br/><br/>4/ when there is no resource tracking for enemies' spell use, how do you adjudicate what enemy spellcasters can do or not and when they run out of spells?\xa0<br/><br/>Thanks for helping me understand!<br/>I.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389712/#Comment_389712" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-09T17:47:18+00:00" title="September  9, 2012  5:47PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 9, 2012 5:48PM by Johnstone.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1. If the dragon is immune to your sword, trying to hit the dragon with your sword doesn't trigger the hack n slash move. It triggers a golden opportunity for the GM to make a hard move. That's what makes the dragon more powerful than a goblin, not the to-hit difficulty -- or rather, it's an in-fiction to-hit difficulty, not a mechanical to-hit difficulty. Find another way, go get a magic, dragon-killing sword, then when you come back you can hack n slash the dragon. Unless he kills you with fire before you get close enough, of course.<br/><br/>2. Niche protection, basically. Especially in Dungeon World, you start off with all the moves, instead of pick two or three. So two human fighters start off mostly the same. This is pretty boring. Once, long ago when I was playing Vampire, I made a character that was a Gangrel lead guitar player. And when we started playing, we found out that another player also made a Gangrel lead guitar player. I had arranged all my points so that I was the absolute best lead guitar player possible, but the other player had read the Toreader Clanbook and knew about the Musical Aptitude merit so his character was actually a better lead guitar player than mine. I was like "fuck this guy" (but thankfully I don't have to play with either of those wankers now, him or me).<br/><br/>3. No idea.<br/><br/>4. Make it up beforehand? Just decide? The NPCs don't have to use the PC rules or anything, their magic can work however you want it to work. Doesn't have to be Vancian, even.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389714/#Comment_389714" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-09T18:51:28+00:00" title="September  9, 2012  6:51PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1. The thing you're missing is "fictional positioning," which is a core concept. You can only make moves when you have the positioning in the fiction of the game to do so. Like Johnstone says, if you have a magic dragon-killing sword, maybe you can just attack a dragon with a normal move. Otherwise, you're kinda fucked.  When you say: "I do [move]" the GM is supposed to ask, "Okay, how do you do that?" which is partially to make sure that makes sense in the fiction. Sometimes you have to do a few things (get into position, obtain an item, sneak somewhere) before you can make the move you want, and sometimes that involves making other moves first (like Defy Danger in DW or Act Under Fire in AW).<br/><br/>2. Practically it's because you only print out one of every playbook when you prep for the game. There's also niche protection stuff. But there are AW-based games where having multiple playbooks of the same time is totally fine, or even ones where there's only one playbook. The Regiment and World of Dungeons are both examples.<br/><br/>3. If you want to do it the easy way, leave it to the players to order their hirelings around. Otherwise, they're less likely to risk their necks for no reason, and kinda skulk in the background. But you can make moves against them when you get to make a GM move. Or you can write impulses for them ("Braktar is arrogant and brash") and then, when there's a quiet moment in the game or the PCs are arguing amongst themselves, you look down at your hirelings and have them act on their impulses (Braktar does something arrogant and brash).<br/><br/>4. NPCs don't use the same rules as PCs. They do whatever they do and aren't limited by spells-per-day or anything like that. They don't have levels anyway. They just do what it fictionally makes sense for them to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389717/#Comment_389717" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-09T19:40:58+00:00" title="September  9, 2012  7:40PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 9, 2012 7:41PM by Felan.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            RE: the dragon question, <a href="http://www.latorra.org/2012/05/15/a-16-hp-dragon/" rel="nofollow">this really sums it up</a>  (originally from the DW forums, posted on Sage's blog).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389719/#Comment_389719" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-09T20:13:10+00:00" title="September  9, 2012  8:13PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What no one has really addressed is the fact that goblins are nigh imortal, all of the other races descended from them you know, and have fended off worse than you for millenia.

I bet there's a goblin sorcerer that has a move like "Put a hex on them." So when they're going up against that guy and get a 7-9 or 6-, that's a thing the sorcerer can do, probably doing some harm/a debility in the process. Like others have said, NPCs don't have to live by the same rules as PCs -- don't feel constrained to limit them to the spells the PCs can access, or force them to adhere to the restrictions the PCs have to live with.\n<blockquote>and when they run out of spells?</blockquote>\nThis isn't really a thing that happens, RAW, in Dungeon World -- at least, in my experience. If the player loses a spell on a miss, that's their call. I guess the GM could make you lose your spell on a miss, but I'm not sure I've ever seen that done. The alternatives are usually more fun/interesting, IMO.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389723">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389723/#Comment_389723" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-09T21:21:41+00:00" title="September  9, 2012  9:21PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, with the answers to question 1...is the mechanism driving AW a "task based" resolution method or "situation based" resolution.<br/><br/>If we need to resolve a bunch of situations in order to get ourselves into position to address the situation...then I'd suggest it's task based, but how do we define the number of tasks to resolve in order to resolve the situation.<br/><br/>For a game claimed to be "highly procedural", and claimed to show GM/MCs exactly how to run things...this gap between narrative to mechanism seems to be a pretty big oversight.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389725/#Comment_389725" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-09T22:36:02+00:00" title="September  9, 2012 10:36PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If we need to resolve a bunch of situations in order to get ourselves into position to address the situation...then I'd suggest it's task based, but how do we define the number of tasks to resolve in order to resolve the situation.</blockquote>\nThere's no explicitly defined "number of tasks to resolve in order to resolve the situation." The players say what their characters are doing. If it falls under a move, do the move. If it doesn't, the DM says what happens. Sometimes, that'll be something like "Your father's sword may have sentimental value beyond measure, but it still bounces off the dragon's tank-like scales. It rears back and takes a deep breath. What do you do?" or "The duke laughs at your request. No, you can't roll to parley, you need actual leverage to do that, unless you think you have some here that I'm missing?"<br/><br/>I guess I'm just not seeing this "gap between narrative to mechanism" you speak of? If what happens in the narrative fiction of the game fulfills the conditions of a move ("When you attack an enemy in melee", "When you consult your accumulated knowledge about something", etc) apply the mechanics associated with that move. It's that easy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389727/#Comment_389727" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-09T22:50:27+00:00" title="September  9, 2012 10:50PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I 1/ hitting a goblin and hitting a dragon have the same difficulty, as situational modifiers do not apply.

Dremmer may be a badass warlord with an army of psychotic goons, but if you've got a gun, or fuck, even a knife, and you're in a position to use it, you just might kill the bastard. <br/><br/>Likewise, in Dungeon World: it doesn't matter how many demon princes you've brought to heel: if that goblin pokes his pointy stick in you, you're gonna bleed. There's no casually dispatching a lesser foe. Pay attention when something is trying to kill you.<br/><br/>That said... look at the stats for a goblin, and a dragon. Yes, your roll to hack and slash them is the same... but the dragon has a lot more hit points, a lot better armor, and deals much more damage on an attack. A fight with the dragon is going to be long and bloody, and when it gets to trade attacks with you because you rolled a 7-9 that 2d10+5 (4 piercing) bite is going to leave much more of a mark than a goblin's 1d6 spear, yeah?<br/><br/>Now, that all said and done... if you, as the DM, really want to make a custom move that says "When you casually dispatch a lesser foe", because that better suits your vision of the world works, then yeah, feel free. Or you could even just say "Yeah, this dude doesn't really count as an 'enemy' any more so much as a 'speedbump', so I don't think Hack and Slash is really even required. You kill it. Your sword gets a little bloody, do you want to leave it like that so that it looks badass or clean it off before sheathing it?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389730/#Comment_389730" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-10T00:59:29+00:00" title="September 10, 2012 12:59AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 10, 2012 1:01AM by John_Harper.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1.

Moves in AW do exactly as much as they say they do, and you invoke them if they say they should be invoked.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389744/#Comment_389744" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-10T14:33:04+00:00" title="September 10, 2012  2:33PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Task vs. conflict is kind of an out-dated distinction, which AW illustrates quite well.

Otherwise the game devolves into a D&amp;D-esque papercut match, where you just hack-and-slash. It isn't mechanically justified to call a 1st-level fighter with a sword and a thousand-year-old adamantium dragon a "fight." Would that be a fight in D&amp;D? Of course not, you'd probably, as GM, let them know so by your description of how horrible the fighter's death was. In DW, which is an homage to that dynamic, if it isn't a fight, you don't trigger the move. If one side or the other so overwhelms its opponent, it isn't worth rolling, because the outcome isn't really uncertain.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389762">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389762/#Comment_389762" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-10T19:13:40+00:00" title="September 10, 2012  7:13PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It'd be like someone saying, "As the car speeds toward, me I'm going to grab on to it's bumper and flip it over.

If he shouts, you're made, but you could take him out with your knife, easy. What do you do?" "Oh, I kill him, of course." "All right. Moving on...." <br/><br/>Also, I don't recall the ruling on this in Dungeon World, but I do know that you can just trade harm for harm in Apocalypse World even if PCs don't feel like making a specific move for a fight. In cases where PCs have serious armor on and NPCs do very little damage, that's effectively the same thing as saying that the PC automatically kills the NPC.<br/><br/>In summary: As folks point out above, it's all about fictional triggers. If it makes sense in your game for level 10 PCs to take out goblins like it ain't no thang, maybe don't even bother with hack and slash unless there's a whole mess of them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389782/#Comment_389782" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-11T06:23:21+00:00" title="September 11, 2012  6:23AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2012 6:23AM by Ry.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I find this hard too.

Is that right?<br/><br/>If so, here's some concrete ways:<br/><br/>It's tougher to get close to an ogre. Weapon ranges set up the fiction for Hack and Slash and the like, and the ogre's got reach on you (most likely) so good luck getting in there with your sword. It'll most likely be Defying Danger to get in close past its long limbs.<br/><br/>An ogre's moves are way tougher. When you get a 7-9 to Hack and Slash a goblin and it gets to counter attack it'll probably stab you or maybe poison you. An ogre might fling you across the room and smash you into a wall.<br/><br/>An ogre, being a big tough thing, will likely have more creatures supporting (or controlling) it. A goblin might have a few goblin friends to watch his back, but an ogre might have a pet worg, some enslaved orcs, and so on.<br/><br/>The fictional description of each probably effects Hack and Slash too. Maybe you as the GM describe the ogre with thick skin like old leather, tough and stiff. That's probably a reasonable fictional basis for saying that hitting it with a stick isn't really Hack and Slashing. On the other hand a goblin's probably kind of squishy, so smacking it with a quarterstaff is an attack.<br/><br/>And, on top of that, there's just the stats of each. One attack (through Hack and Slash, Volley, or just dealing damage because of the fiction) is fairly likely to kill a goblin. That's much less likely for an ogre, which means it has more time to do bad stuff to you.\n<blockquote>Can we feel free to ignore the *when you do it, you do it* when we feel it's appropriate? How would that break the game?</blockquote>\nI'm probably biased, but I'd say don't ignore it.<br/><br/>What you should do (and this may be what you're getting at) is clarify the fiction. Sometimes swinging your weapon at something isn't Hack and Slash. There are examples in the book of it not being Hack and Slash because the creature you're attacking can't defend itself (so you jkust deal your damage) or because there's no chance of actually harming it (so the GM just describes the outcome).<br/><br/>Once you start ignoring the fictional triggers the game gets a little loose and formless. The moves (player moves and GM moves) all reflect what the game is about in pretty core ways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389806/#Comment_389806" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-11T11:16:16+00:00" title="September 11, 2012 11:16AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ry, I meant: if I say I swing my sword at something, then this should mechanically force a hack&amp;slash move, unless this is fictionally incoherent.

Whereas in Dungeon World, you have to think about it before the dice are rolled, and decide who's a threat to whom based entirely on the fiction.

It's probably murder, though.<br/>- Likewise, if you swing at an armed and angry ogre, it might not be hack and slash, either!

(a.k.a Portray a fantastic world)<br/><br/>You're the players' window on the world. Your judgement is entirely based on the fiction in <em>your game</em>. Your dragons could be common beasts kept as pets (you'd probably want to run them through the monster creation rules again in this case, as it likely changes their stats). In that case, you portray that fiction, and maybe their flesh isn't that tough and smacking them with any old blade can hurt them (maybe triggering a move like Hack and Slash, maybe dealing damage, maybe Defending, whatever).<br/><br/>That's the entirety of the criteria. You look at the fiction and see if what's happening really could hurt someone, based on the situation. A village-forged sword against inch-thick metalic plates on a beast older than dirt with an ancient spell forged from a star protecting it? Probably not an attack, so you take that into account when triggering moves. A village-forged sword against the lizard-like scales of what's essentially a big lizard with really bad breath? Sure, that sounds like an attack, so that might trigger a move of some sort.<br/><br/>The monster stats in the book provide a useful starting point. The dragon stats mention some things that inform the fiction, if you use our dragon. If you don't, no big deal. The really baked-into-the-game bit isn't <em>what</em> monsters are tougher than others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB" title="PeterBB"><img alt="PeterBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB">PeterBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389824/#Comment_389824" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-11T13:55:31+00:00" title="September 11, 2012  1:55PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2012 1:56PM by PeterBB.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>Being worried about fiat makes sense, but I think it's important to make a distinction between <i>deciding</i> if something's a threat, and <i>judging</i> if something's a threat.

But in your particular game, you'll be making moves, following your agendas and principles, and saying what you should always say, and I suspect you'll oftener than not find it pretty obvious what comes next.<br/><br/>Say the party is exploring a dungeon, which is full of all sorts of dangers (because you're "Filling the characters' lives with adventure"). They've entered the dungeon before, but they turned back after a tense standoff with a giant lizard. They're back, and they've brought ranged weapons this time, since it was seemingly slow.<br/><br/>Your players enter the front chamber and ask "What do we see?" Since they're looking to you to see what happens, you have to make a move. You decide to "Show signs of an approaching threat". <br/><br/>You could just have it be the lizard, but since they left and came back, you've been "Thinking offscreen" and decided to advance one of your Fronts' Grim Portents. One of your fronts has to do with a wizard (Arcane Enemy - Power-mad Wizard. <i>Impulse: to seek magical power</i>) who is manipulating the goblins (Horde - Humanoid Vermin. <i>Impulse: to breed - to multiply and consume</i>) into leaving the dungeon and attacking civilization. One of your grim portents is that they disrupt the ecology of the dungeon by spreading into the whole complex. <br/><br/>So, because of all that, and because you're "Thinking Dangerous", you decide that your move will be: "You enter the chamber, and are immediately assaulted by the smell of offal and blood. You see the lizard, stabbed in multiple places, and with its head removed. Written in its blood on the wall is something in Goblinish script, but you can't read it."<br/><br/>Then, later in the dungeon, the players fail a roll, and its time for a hard move. You decide to "Separate them". You look at your dungeon map ("Draw maps, leave blanks") and see that they're near the edge of the goblins' territory. So you say, "You're carefully tracing the path as you go, and get deeply absorbed in doing so. You don't notice the movements above you until, all of a sudden, three creatures swing down on ropes and snatch up Theomar. Thorg, you can turn in time to see them disappear into a hole in the ceiling."<br/><br/>Because the principles say to "give every monster life", you also say, "Theomar, you can see that these creatures are quite small, no more than three feet tall. They're humanoid, but with joints that bend the wrong way. Their long, wiry fingers grip you with an impressive strength. They take you to a dank room lit by sputtering torches, where a slightly larger version of the creatures is addressing an assembly of some sort. He turns to you and begins to speak in a heavily accented, but passable, Common."<br/><br/>Then, yet later, Theomar tries to parley with the goblin leader ("Griklak", since you have to "name every person"), he fails again. You decide that Griklak is infuriated, and immediately flies at Theomar. Theomar says, "I grab a sword off a nearby goblin" (He rolls to Defy Danger and succeeds) and then I take a swipe at Griklak. I want to chop the fucker's head off."<br/><br/>Does the player roll Hack and Slash? I think it's pretty clear that the answer at this point has to be yes. You've seen the goblins kill the lizard, you've felt their strength, you've watched their speed. It's pretty clear.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389825/#Comment_389825" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-11T13:58:16+00:00" title="September 11, 2012  1:58PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel like it's pretty fantastic to wade into a sea of goblins, swinging my sword, screaming bloody murder and for, you know, it not to be hack and slash.

That's deliberate, to avoid comparison. Level is just shorthand for how many abilities they have. It's not a fictional thing.

I mean, since the game doesn't really model accidentally hitting a weak spot. <br/><br/>That said, if you want to model some accidental junk, a custom move is easy:<br/><br/>When someone swings their weapon blindly against a fire they're unlikely to damage, have them roll + nothing. On a 10, two, on a 7-9, one: they hit a weak spot and roll damage, they know what the weak spot is and how to do it again, they don't get attacked in kind. <br/><br/>Or <br/><br/>When a creatures defenses make it unlikely someone could damage it, roll one die. On a 6, they may hack and slash, otherwise they get attacked before they can do much. If the character is a fighter, paladin or ranger, make it a 5 or 6.<br/><br/>Either of them make the chances fairly slim in comparison to normal, and certainly make their lives interesting.

Your judgement is entirely based on the fiction in <em>your game</em>. Your dragons could be common beasts kept as pets (you'd probably want to run them through the monster creation rules again in this case, as it likely changes their stats).</blockquote>\nThat's the entirety of the criteria. You look at the fiction and see if what's happening really could hurt someone, based on the situation. A village-forged sword against inch-thick metalic plates on a beast older than dirt with an ancient spell forged from a star protecting it? Probably not an attack, so you take that into account when triggering moves. A village-forged sword against the lizard-like scales of what's essentially a big lizard with really bad breath? Sure, that sounds like an attack, so that might trigger a move of some sort.</blockquote>\nWell, but these are overblown examples.  If the PCs are trying to attack, then they presumably think they've got a chance.  The likely case is that it's a well-made steel sword wielded by a strong expert striking against an old, super-strong beast with very hard scales and very dense muscles.  <br/><br/>If I was just thinking about the fictional world and not about the mechanics, my answer would be something like "Well, it could do a little damage - especially if they're lucky and/or skillful enough to strike in a weak spot - but the chances are slim."  <br/><br/>In practice, I could make either the call that he can go ahead and roll hack, or not - and either way have a fun game.  Both versions would be significantly different in outcome and feel, but consistent with the facts as I gave them before.  I'm capable of making that judgment, but it feels false to me to claim that it is an easy, obvious decision that is precisely defined by the rules.  <br/><br/>So long as it has a reasonable chance of doing harm and the defender is able to defend themselves, it's Hack and Slash<br/><br/>I guess I don't know how else to state it? Your example there\u2014"it could do a little damage, but chances are slim"\u2014that's Hack and Slash plus some strong armor. The fact that you think "it could do [...] damage" means that the "attack" criteria is met (I'll assume the "melee" requirement is met as well) so the move triggers. The "a little [...] chances are slim" part is covered by the damage rules, in particular armor and HP. If you're using a pre-made monster then we've already figured those out, based on the fiction. Otherwise you came up with them yourself. Either way, I feel like both parts are covered.<br/><br/>Is it a judgement call? Yes, of course. But it seems like a pretty easy one to me. The rules define two conditions that must be met, in the fiction. You (and everyone else at the table) make a judgement call on if those apply.\n<blockquote><blockquote>I feel like it's pretty fantastic to wade into a sea of goblins, swinging my sword, screaming bloody murder and for, you know, it not to be hack and slash.  Maybe in my game, if you do that, you just deal your damage to all the goblins.  That's part of the fantasy.  Total goblin annihilation.<br/><br/>It's a cop out to say "it's a move when it's a move and it's not when it isn't" but it's the truth.  It's dependent on all kinds of shit that emerges both from the principles and agenda and how you (with help from your players' input) come to understand them.</blockquote>\nI don't think what you say here by itself is a cop-out.  I think subjective judgment works fine for all sorts of things.  It isn't actually that tough to GM something like Amber Diceless, A Thousand and One Nights, or even pure pretend without rules.  <br/><br/>I do think it is a cop-out to both claim that it works this way and say that the choice is precisely defined by the rules + the fiction. </blockquote>\nRules: "When you attack an enemy in melee..."<br/>Fiction: "These monsters aren't even able to defend themselves to you, we already know you're beyond simple goblins. As you wade through them you leave bloody goblin corpses strewn about and emerge on the dias where Garlax, the Goblin God, sits.

It seems like doing those things makes the difference between the party trying to make the suicidal charge and having enough information to realize that that almost certainly won't work with some monsters.  In other words, those techniques and moves are key to making and maintaining the shared understanding of the fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389975/#Comment_389975" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-12T17:39:24+00:00" title="September 12, 2012  5:39PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>However, if someone *really* wants to do it, it won't break the game the way it would in AW, Monsterhearts, or MotW.</blockquote>\n"If two people in the group are interested in playing the same Skin, there are a couple of ways to handle that.

A situation like this:<br/><br/>Player: "I run the ogre through with my sword!"<br/><br/>GM 1: "Okay, sounds like Hack and Slash"<br/><br/>GM 2: "He has reach on you, how're you getting close enough?"<br/><br/>GM 3: "It seems like your sword doesn't really have much chance of harming him, yeah?"<br/><br/>I guess in that way it's not "precisely defined" in that at different tables given the same fictional starting point the GMs could arrive at different judgement calls. <br/><br/>But! If those GMs are playing by the rules they're portraying a fictional world and making their judgements based on the fiction and communicating those with the players. So what's essentially happened is the GMs have established facts about the fiction: GM 1 says that an orge's reach and thick skin aren't a big deal in the world, GM 2 says that (presumably) orgres bleed like everyone else but they're hard to get to, GM 3 says their reach isn't a big deal but their flesh is tough. (Of course this is assuming that everything to that point is the same\u2014it's also possible to be in a situation where the ogre's normally dangerous reach isn't a big deal.) So long as they're all being consistent, communicating the fiction to the players, and abiding by the rules, all of those are valid. Nothing in the game depends on how tough a monster is, just on the fact that the monster's toughness is clearly rooted in the fiction.<br/><br/>I see that as "precisely defined" per table, but not "precisely defined" table-to-table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390216/#Comment_390216" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-14T08:18:51+00:00" title="September 14, 2012  8:18AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now I want to do some portal fantasy where I get up from my DW game and just go sit down at another DW game.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390223">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390223/#Comment_390223" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-14T10:03:52+00:00" title="September 14, 2012 10:03AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cross-posted from RPG.NET:<br/>The parallel to Sage's example in D&amp;D is:<br/><br/>Player: "I run the ogre through with my sword!"<br/><br/>GM1: Okay, roll to-hit.<br/><br/>GM2: His arms are really long.

If the party makes too much noise or causes an alert to be raised, it will come upon the scene in 1d4+1 rounds?" You as the GM are arbitrarily deciding which monster(s) or statblocks to use, and in doing so are dialing in the difficulty for the PCs. You as the GM are pre-determining the traps. It's story-before, but it's still fiat. Trad RPGs rely on a GM who is willing to make judgment calls at some point. DW just makes this more apparent, since its story-now play relies on judgment calls being made on-the-fly, as opposed to beforehand.

The MC telling the player their longsword won't do much good against a werewolf because the MC doesn't want the werewolf to die is fiat. It's an arbitrary reason to say "no you can't attack it". Saying the player's longsword won't do much good against a werewolf because it was agreed upon earlier in the game that werewolves can only be harmed by silver weapons is not fiat. That's preserving the fiction.<br/><br/>So if I understand, theoretically Dungeon World doesn't tell you if werewolves are only vulnerable to silver weapons, but if it's established during the game, that's a prompt for the MC to say "Well, you can't Hack and Slash because your weapon is made of steel not silver."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390275/#Comment_390275" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-14T13:46:02+00:00" title="September 14, 2012  1:46PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>So if I understand, theoretically Dungeon World doesn't tell you if werewolves are only vulnerable to silver weapons, but if it's established during the game, that's a prompt for the MC to say "Well, you can't Hack and Slash because your weapon is made of steel not silver."</blockquote>\nA bit of both, actually. I think the werewolf actually says "vulnerable to silver" as a Special Quality, just because that one's kind of ingrained. Which isn't to say it can't be different, just that there we thought it was a reasonable default.<br/><br/>Incorporeal is an even better example: several monsters say their incorporeal and that generally means mundane items don't do anything to them. That's something we established ahead of time for some monsters because for, say, a ghost it just makes sense.<br/><br/>So either because it's established by your prep or because it falls out of Spout Lore or whatever, some monsters might be invulnerable to some things, or vulnerable to others, or whatever. The important part is what gets established around the table, and playing consistently with that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman" title="Ross_Cowman"><img alt="Ross_Cowman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2VVx8Kc--zY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACZ8/3Pco6NeJ4Ng/photo.jpg?sz=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman">Ross_Cowman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390277/#Comment_390277" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-14T14:33:50+00:00" title="September 14, 2012  2:33PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In AW you ask questions and then use those answers to make the player's lives interesting. <br/>For example, in an AW game at PAX a couple of weeks ago, I started by asking each player small details about where they lived.

Just follow the characters around in their normal lives, find out what they are afraid of, then turn those fears into monsters. <br/><br/>Ask the warrior, why do you carry around a sword, what do you need to defend yourself from?<br/>Ask the thief, why did you teach yourself to hide in shadows, what are you hiding from?<br/><br/>When you put the creative decisions in the hands of the players you get a level of buy in that is uniquely satisfying.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390279/#Comment_390279" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-14T14:35:12+00:00" title="September 14, 2012  2:35PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 14, 2012 2:38PM by Zachary_Wolf.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Makes sense to me.

Do you let them "learn the hard way by trial and error" or do you try to hint at it with Future Badness?<br/><br/>I think stating it flat out is kind of lame, IMO.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman" title="Ross_Cowman"><img alt="Ross_Cowman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2VVx8Kc--zY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACZ8/3Pco6NeJ4Ng/photo.jpg?sz=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman">Ross_Cowman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390280/#Comment_390280" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-14T14:50:22+00:00" title="September 14, 2012  2:50PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here is a big deviation between AW and the way most folks play DW. <br/>In AW you look to the fiction for your answer.

It says, AFAIK, not to prep encounters but IMO thats a bit different from not prepping anything. Forex look at the hollow children "harm move" in the book, that must have been prepped.

Well, that was a black werewolf, this is a white werewolf. It's only susceptible to fire.  In some groups and situations this is an awesome twist. In other groups and situations, it's a dreadful mistake.

The MC can still totally do a bunch of stuff. And in practice, I've found that if the MC doesn't do stuff to really drive play, the game can seem pretty flat. You can't always follow the characters around because sometimes the characters aren't actively pursuing things other than their own pleasure and safety and that's not really what the game's about. Plus, they have enough agency that -- without the MC really bringing it -- they're pretty capable of creating a tidy life for themselves, even amidst the waste.<br/><br/>Plus, the MC is a player too, right? The things you want out of the game are just as important as what the players want! The MC makes their voice present at the table by doing the same thing the other players do: bringing the fire, making hard choices, playing close to the bone, barfing forth, etc. And if you abide by your principles and moves, you do that without running roughshod over what the players want. That, I think, is where the magic is: where those energies meet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390316/#Comment_390316" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-15T00:53:15+00:00" title="September 15, 2012 12:53AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 15, 2012 12:54AM by John_Harper.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, jeez, Ross, no.

Like, say I make a big badass clan of cannibals and I'm like: "Can't wait to see what happens when they eat one of the Operator's crew." But then the Battlebabe sneaks into the cannibal compound at night and straight-up assassinates the leader while the Hocus brings all the cannibals into her cult and makes them promise not to eat people no more. Well, shit. That's why we play to find out, right? Because just because I say stuff as MC or plot stuff doesn't make it so. The PCs can totally take that and do whatever they want to with it. Maybe there's one ex-cannibal Gretch who's not really over how awesome people taste, who will still make a play after one of the Operator's crew, but it's in a completely different context now and may not even be important anymore. As the MC, I don't get to decide who or what's important in the game, necessarily. I just put the messed-up world out there, play my stuff as hard as I can/want, and the PCs engage with it based on what they care about. Anyway, that's been my experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390588/#Comment_390588" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-17T15:16:40+00:00" title="September 17, 2012  3:16PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><br/>I still use and love the variation (can't remember who came up with it) where on a miss, you tell the players something patently false, and if they act on it or convince others to act on it, they mark XP.

It's a combination, as a GM, of "ask questions and build on the answers" and offering something at a cost, with a little bit of a bend to the "address the characters" rule.<br/><br/>Failed Spout Lore = "Okay, Xeno, so these Goblins here, despite their terrifying appearance, they're peaceful Goblins who just want to be loved.
