                    OK, so here's my dilemma.  <br/><br/>Some games define a conflict as solely between players.  That is, there isn't a conflict unless another player objects to your narration.  A simple example is Soap.  The mechanic is that anyone can enter any sentence of narration on their turn.  The only way that it doesn't happen is if another player objects to that sentence.  <br/><br/>Here's what I found when playing Soap with a few friends -- play could go around for several rounds of all the players without an objection.  Even if bad things were happening, players were often content to let them occur.  In order to create a conflict, I had to narrate something that was not only bad for another character -- I had to narrate it such that the <i>player</i> didn't like it.  This worked in a sense, but I was troubled by this.  It's much much better in Polaris, because one player (The Mistaken) has the designated job of coming up with narration which the player opposite won't like.  In Polaris, I'm not really playing for what I want as a person.  Rather, I'm sort of role-playing an abstraction ("What the forces of the Mistaken want") rather than a specific character.  So I (John) don't want the game to turn out that Bill's PC suffers as much as possible and never succeeds.  However, as a player of the Mistaken, that is my job and I do it.  "Drifter's Escape" is also good for this -- two players are "role-playing" the Devil and "the Man".  That gives a direction for what to play.  If I'm playing the Devil, I call for a conflict if something happens which the Devil doesn't like.  <br/><br/>In some other games, rolls are called for at defined times.  For example, whenever a minion wants to do Violence or Villainy to a townsperson, the player has to make the appropriate roll.  In "Breaking the Ice", there is an attraction roll for each scene.  Really, calling for rolls at specific times is common in many RPGs.  <br/><br/>So how do we define conflicts, or more generally the need for resolution?  I see a few functional options here: <br/><br/>1) Define conflict as between characters, and give ownership of certain characters to different players.  When a character of one player comes into conflict with a character of another, then the players may agree to a roll.  <br/><br/>2) Define abstract roles for different players, like the Mistaken.  A players "role-plays" this force and what it wants.  <br/><br/>3) Define when rolls should happen independent of the wishes of the characters.  <br/><br/>What are the advantages and disadvantages of each of these?                </div>

                            I've always had some trouble with "player vs. player" conflicts, as well. In most groups I play in, there will be very few conflict rolls with this approach. Because we can all agree that, yes, Billy getting his hand cut off is a cool thing. In a "say yes or roll the dice" sense, we would almost always be saying yes.<br/>
<br/>
I prefer a little more structure for conflicts, in the style of Polaris or PTA. It's not about the players having a conflict of interest, it's about the <i>character</i> wanting something, and facing an obstacle to that.<br/>
<br/>
I think a blend of your oprions 1 and 2 is what I'm after these days, both in design and in play. The advantage is, the rules tell us that we need to have conflict rolls, and then they require us to have them. So there's no disconnect there. Full agreement among the players doesn't keep conflict rolls from happening.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure what the downside of this method is, but maybe someone else can supply that.                        </div>

                            Nine Worlds explicitly defines conflict as two <i>players</i> disagreeing about "what happens next." (The game master is a player.) It's the first thing I explain in the rules chapter. <br><br>Now, certainly, when we play we can all smile and get along and come up with COOL stuff collaboratively narrating events. Neat. It's also powerfuly under-rewarded. As in, no conflict, no reward. PERIOD. No so neat.<br><br>If your interests as a player do not conflict with another player's interests, you are doomed to never accruing Points, never altering your Muses, never resolving your Muses. In short, you are doomed to a boring game.<br><br>So, my answer in one of my games is: "Yes, absolutley, conflict is totally about when players disagree about what they want to happen in narration. But, the trick is that they are hugely <i>rewarded</i> for doing this. If they don't, the game will be set on 'idle' until conflict happens."<br/><br/>Actually, right now, I'm not seeing how ANY conflict resolution in any game works otherwise.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

So I've got a slight feeling but am not entirely sure how things work.  What should I to do if I personally really liked a player's narration of his plan for freeing the prisoner from the transport, and privately feel that it would be cooler if he succeeded than if he failed?  <br/><br/>It seems like a tricky thing.  In boardgames and card games, there are usually defined victory conditions to play for.  So I play to achieve those conditions rather than a vague "have things the way I like them".  The game is still fun for other people even if I get the victory conditions.  The same thing applies to Polaris.  The Mistaken has a defined goal, and when I am someone's Mistaken I play for that goal.  In both these, the game is giving me directions as to what I should be trying for.  <br/><br/>Is there a similar directive in Nine Worlds?                        </div>

<i>--- crossposted with john kim. I think he says it a little better than I do, below ---</i><br/>
<br/>
That bit in Nine Worlds always bothered me, Matt. Because of course I want to be rewarded with points and such. So of course I want to engage the conflict system. But it's very easy (automatic, even) for me to get along with my fellow players and not disagree about what happens next. So, in order to engage the reward system, I have to either A) "pretend" to be in disagreement, for the sake of drawing a conflict or <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> Narrate something no one really wants to see (including me, probably) in order to prompt a conflict.<br/>
<br/>
Option A will be the one I choose every time, and it falls a little flat for me.<br/>
<br/>
What's actually happening is we're drawing a conflict when the character tries to get something and is opposed by another entity in the game world. The players aren't in disagreement. Everyone thinks it would be cool if Heracles tries to capture Aristo, for example. Does he get away or not? I don't know, let's have a conflict and see.<br/>
<br/>
What is NOT happening (in my games) is: Heracles's player DEMANDS that Heracles capture Aristo and Aristo's player DEMANDS that he get away -- and the two of them can't come to an agreement, so we have to draw a conflict. That never, ever happens, and I don't expect it to.<br/>
<br/>
See what I mean? When we're in the flow of the game and everyone is grooving on the imaginary vision, there aren't any "what happens next" disagreements. Aristo gets captured? Cool! He escapes later by dressing up like an Aegis agent? Cool! And so on. We're all happy and agreeing, and no one gets rewarded. Bah.<br/>
<br/>
I'd rather not jump through any hoops of pretending to be in disagreement just so I can engage the reward system.                        </div>

                            Hmm, I just see myself disagreeing on principle fairly often, not because I dislike narration, but because I can think of something else interesting that could happen.<br>
<br>
I think this is just an off-shoot of stakes-setting.  What you're looking for is not moments of disagreement, but moments when the act of choosing between two divergent but interesting alternatives will be fun for the group as a whole.  Of course, if they are blowing you away with their narration of how things go wrong for their character, fine--but sometimes it is interesting to act as the advocate for the other side.  Give them a chance to get out scott-free, to get away with murder for now.  Force the possibility of being the only survivor, or the person who doesn't care about others on the character--just to see if it gets them riled up.<br>
<br>
If antagonists are not against the character but against the player, then you can be the antagonist by being against the player and for the character.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

In some of the recent play, I created a muse, "Leave Aristo behind on Mercury."  I have not had any problem using my character to create problems for Aristo.<br>

Perhaps its my long history as a gamemaster, but I don't have any problem with creating drama for other peoples characters.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Right. I don't have any trouble with that either. That's not where I see the problem.<br/>
<br/>
The problem I see is, the players don't have to disagree in order to create interesting, productive conflicts for the characters. But the Nine Worlds text says that conflict starts when the players disagree about what happens next.<br/>
<br/>
I don't play that way. I usually <b>agree</b> with the other players, <i>especially</i> when they're creating drama and adversity for my character. We don't start conflicts because we as players disagree, we start them because we think it would be cool for our characters to get into trouble. That's all I'm really saying.                        </div>

                            It seems like we're getting caught up on the word "disagreement." I'm not actually seeing much, um, disagreement about the issue, though. Anyone?<br>
<br>
John, I stick by my claim and by that wording. If you have a different idea than another player, and you want to see which one happens -- even if both are cool -- I term that disagreement. I call it that because agreement would be picking one mutually and going with it. "What happens next, this or that?" Advocating a position necessitates that you "disagree" with at least one other player about what's going down.<br>
<br>
In my experience, Nine Worlds usually works something like this: <br>
<br>
Player: "I my Archon want to go to Mars. My character has a Join the Free Spartan League muse."<br/>
<br/>
GM: "Ok, you go to Mars." <br/>
<br/>
(The players agree. No conflict. Then, later ... )<br/>
<br/>
Player: "I want to join the Free Spartan League. Remember that Muse I have?"<br/>
<br/>
GM: "Um, neat. But, they won't let you in. You have to prove yourself first. Kick Leonidas IV's butt first in their new arena, and you're in."<br/>
<br/>
Player: "Awesome! Draw cards, man!"<br/>
<br/>
BUT, nine worlds can work like this: <br/>
<br/>
Player 1: "We're going to Mars."<br/>
<br/>
Player 2: "No, Mars sucks. Remember what happened last time? I don't want us to go there. Besides, we've both got Muses on Jupiter, let's go there."<br/>
<br/>
GM: "Sounds like a conflict to me. Draw. The winner decides where the aethership goes."<br/>
<br/>
Player 1: "Damn."<br/>
<br/>
I call both of these situations disagreement about what happens next. In the first example, when the player wanted to join the Free Spartan League, the GM could have just as easily have said "Right, you're in." The Game Master had a choice (as could other players in similar situaitons). He could have agreed to the player's desire to join, just like that. It would have resolved a Muse (which means I sorta lied eariler -- you can get rewarded in Nine Worlds outside of a conflict). The players would have been agreeing about what happens next. Agreement/disagreement, narration/adversity. <br/>
<br/>
Similarly, in the second example, Player 1 and Player 2 could have come to some kind of negotiation. Maybe Player 2 relents and goes to Mars. Or, maybe vice versa. If they can't resolve their ideas about what happens next in the story, the GM did the right thing there.<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, I term both disagreement between players about what happens next.<br/>
Others do not dig this use of the word disagreement. (shrug) Seems to me we're talking about the same thing. That's cool.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

<i>EDIT: cross-posted with Matt Snyder.  I'll reply in a separate post.</i><br/><br/>Er, yeah.  What John Harper and Shreyas said.  <br/><br/>To elaborate:  I don't have any problem creating drama for other people's characters either.  My point was that I'm trying to create drama for their characters -- which is something that the other players actually enjoy.  Perhaps you're interpreting my Soap example wrong (?).  It's not that the story was boring and that all of the characters got along.  Quite the opposite.  The story had lots of drama.  That's exactly what made it lack <i>player</i> conflict.  The players didn't object to their characters encountering trouble on the meta-level where Soap's mechanics are.  So for a while, we just got into adding sentences to the story.  For example, I narrated a scene where Liz's character woke up drunk and late for an urgent operation that she was supposed to do.  Liz reacted like "Cool" and didn't bid to change it.  I think we went around two or three more rounds and then I decided to try out the mechanic by deliberately narrating something which Liz would <i>not</i> like in the story.                        </div>

                            Aha! John Harper, I just went back and re-read and found where we're getting caught up (er, I think). <br/><br/>You said: 
<blockquote>What's actually happening is we're drawing a conflict when the character tries to get something and is opposed by another entity in the game world. The players aren't in disagreement. Everyone thinks it would be cool if Heracles tries to capture Aristo, for example. Does he get away or not? I don't know, let's have a conflict and see.</blockquote>
Yeah, sure, the players agree this is a cool scene. So what? That's agreement about the scene framing, not about the outcome. I'm talking about disagreement about outcome, not framing.<br/><br/>The key to the statment is <i>what happens next</i>. By that I mean the outcome: Is Aristo captured or not? There, the players disagree. Herakles' player says "Yes, catpured." Aristo's player says "No way, not captured." If the DON'T disagree and take these stances, what the hell are they doing entering a conflict? They should just narrate the story if they agree! Simple. <br/><br/>BUT, if they don't have a vested interest in one outcome or another, what the hell is going on then? If you're playing Aristo, and you don't want to avoid capture, then I say you need to have your head examined. I mean, what the hell must you be thinking to say "Eh, I don't care, and neither does Aristo, whether or not he's captured. Isn't this a great scene?" BOOOO! No, it is not. It's a scene filled with no actual player-to-player tension and probably a bunch of posing. If you have something actually riding on the outcome, and are surprised one way or another, then yes it'll be a great scene then.
<blockquote>What is NOT happening (in my games) is: Heracles's player DEMANDS that Heracles capture Aristo and Aristo's player DEMANDS that he get away -- and the two of them can't come to an agreement, so we have to draw a conflict. That never, ever happens, and I don't expect it to.</blockquote>
This is a valid conflict resolution. I've seen it happen, and if the group agrees to the rules, it's the most basic and important reason system exists. That it doesn't happen at your table doesn't invalidate use of the word "disagreement."<br/><br/>I mean, consider. The difference between Herakles' player saying "I DEMAND this happens" and "My goal for this conflict is this thing happens" is very little.  In the first statment, the player is either acting like a dick, or could back of on his tone or something. But, eithe way, they're staking their creative claims. Stakes ... goals. Nine Worlds is built purposefully to handle this.<br/><br/>Frankly, I think it's a shame that it doesn't happen that way at your table sometimes. It makes for some truly suprising outcomes in the story, and I've found such suprises to be the biggest delight to my gaming experience in the last year or two.                        </div>

                            Ah ha! I see it now. Your use of "disagreement" is not one I'm familiar with.<br/><br/>All that stuff you talk about in your post to me above? I do that stuff. That stuff is not "player disagreement" to me. It's player-provided adversity, tension, pushing for exciting outcomes -- all that. Yes.<br/><br/>When we play, we are all in agreement that "what happens next" should be obstacles to our protagonist's desires, tension, uncertainty, suffering, etc. We are throwing that at each other non-stop. And yes, OF COURSE we care about certain outcomes more than others, and are fully invested in the story of our character.<br/><br/>And, when it comes right down to it, even if the GM and I agree about what happens next, <i>we are still very likely to draw for a conflict anyway</i>, because that makes for more tension, more uncertainty, more twists to the tale (and more engagement with the reward system). To me, the thing that sparks a conflict is not "player disagreement" but earnest, committed play that always drives towards important conflicts with uncertain outcomes.<br/><br/>But if we're down to semantics, I'm happy to wave it away and call it good.                        </div>

That's because it relied on us naturally generating player-to-player disagreement.  (Technically there is the goal of finding other players' secrets, but there isn't much you can actively do towards that on your turn -- nor do you have much motive to stop other players on their turn.)  In Soap, resolution happens with every sentence.  Either the sentence gets added or it doesn't.  The problem is, it's very difficult to narrate anything which can't be effectively undone on the next player's turn.  <br/><br/>In contrast, Polaris worked better for us, because it gave clearer directives of what the players should try for.  So as the Mistaken, I have a clear task for my game role.  Conflicts can be judged as between what the Mistaken wants (i.e. the in-game force of demons) and what the character (i.e. the Heart) wants.  Maybe a different example would work better.  Let's try from something you said:<br/><br/><b>Matt Snyder</b> wrote...<br/><i>BUT, if they don't have a vested interest in one outcome or another, what the hell is going on then?

It's a scene filled with no actual player-to-player tension and probably a bunch of posing.</i><br/><br/>I don't think this example is very useful, because it includes both player and character.  So, obviously Aristo wants to avoid capture.  But what about the player?  What if you eliminate the "neither does Aristo" from your statement?  So I'm playing Aristo, and thinking about it, I feel that some prison drama could be cool.  Thus, I the player am fine with Aristo being captured.  However, Aristo hates it and fights capture tooth-and-nail.  Do you still think I need to have my head examined?  <br/><br/>This is particularly an issue for the GM, but it can be for players as well.                        </div>

                            John Harper, you're calling me on it. That's not what I'm interested in, because, no, I don't think you're that silly. I'm interested in whether I made the distinction between two things worth noting so we understand each other here. I wasn't interested in "accusing" you of ... anything at all. C'mon back at you! We're discussing the issue, not casting stones.<br/>
<br/>
John Kim, fine, remove the "Aristo doesn't want to." That's actually better. It better supports what I'm arguing, which is that players either agree with one another about outcome or they don't (i.e. agreement = no conflict, disagreement = conflict), and that I'm saying "agreement" about framing is NOT equal to agreement about outcome.<br/>
<br/>
In your latest example, where you want prison drama to happen, you are AGREEING with the other player that Aristo gets captured and then simply coloring a fun scene where he resists (i.e. agreeing about the outcome). Again, no conflict in that situation because players agree about what should go down.<br/>
<br/>
So, did the point about framing vs. outcome as "disagreement" make any sense?                        </div>

                            One of the issues that resonates here and in the "Why a GM" questions is about conflicts.<br/><br/>Personally I think that adversarial roles taken on by the players can have a very negative effect on the game. One of the main reasons for a GM in my view is to assume those negative roles instead of the other players. While this will create an us against "him" mentality; a good GM can use that.<br/><br/>One of the things that I have dome to accomplish this is to eliminate opposed roles and replace them with difficulties based on flat values. So if I have a mental+skill of 12 I have the same minus to charm as anyone else with a mental+skill of 12, and not a 3d6 roll that may offer more or less resistance.

Did my point about the spark for conflicts make sense? Are we actually just calling it by different names, or do we still have something else to discuss here?                        </div>

It better supports what I'm arguing, which is that players either agree with one another about outcome or they don't (i.e. agreement = no conflict, disagreement = conflict), and that I'm saying "agreement" about framing is NOT equal to agreement about outcome.</i><br><br>I'd like to try to slow down a bit and sound out where are differences are.  Yes, agreement about framing isn't the same as agreement about outcome.  And yes, obviously players either agree or they don't.  I don't think I said anything that disagreed with that.  In the Soap game I cited, we were agreeing on both framing and outcome.  The players had bad things happen (i.e. outcomes) to their PCs, and weren't spending tokens to contest them.  <br><br/>But getting back to my topic: a games mechanics don't have to be defined as happening when the <i>players</i> disagree.  All three of my options (#1, <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, and #3) were about options where the players don't have to disagree as people.  I guess I should add in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a> -- the players disagree as people, and one player proposes something which another player doesn't like.  <br/><br/>I'd like to go on about the advantages and disadvantages of all four of these, but first, does what I've said so far make sense?                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Cool. Guys, yes, I think we're agreeing noisily. No sweat.<br/>
<br/>
John Haper, yes, the sparks thing makes sense. I think it's all-but required for what I'm talking about as well. I think it's worth discussing this, AND that we're probably calling it different names. What I mean is we can always discuss it and learn something, or instuct to other readers, perhaps.                        </div>
