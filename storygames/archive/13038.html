Just one catch - it\u2019s in Tucson, Arizona, and she lives in New Jersey.  Her father says she can go, but on two conditions:  she takes her seventeen year old sister--Ruby--with her, and her cousin--Joe, to make sure they don\u2019t get into too much trouble.  Her father is not only Joe\u2019s uncle but also his boss at an architecture firm where Joe does drafting.  <br/><br/>So they get in her green VW bug with fresh flowers in the bud vase, and head out.<br/><br/>Her first situation - in a restaurant in Pennsylvania she catches her little sister making out with a total stranger.  She scolds her little sister, trying to get her to stop, (earns a black stone and rolls +/-/-)<br/>Ruby:  Don\u2019t mess this up for me!<br/>Amber:   He\u2019s twice your age!<br/>Strange man:  Twice her age?  Wait - how old are you?<br/>Amber:  She\u2019s seventeen!<br/>Strange man:  Woah!  I thought you were twenty one.<br/>Ruby:  Argh.  (Runs out of the restaurant.)<br/>And Joe picks this moment to get food poisoning.<br/><br/>(Going like that, trying to fix the Prices of each previous roll kept things comical for a while:)  Joe fell in a well and couldn\u2019t get out, the tow truck they used to try and rescue him broke, his pants ripped embarrassingly, their car was stolen, Ruby got in a car with a different strange man and drove away, and Joe and Amber ended up getting arrested.  Finally they got a good roll - so Ruby bailed them out and the new strange man (\u201cDwight\u201d) offered to take them to the concert.<br/><br/>Dwight gets everyone but Joe baked on the drive.  Amber goes along with it when he gives the pipe to Ruby. (And earns a white stone which she uses to buy off one of her black ones.)<br/><br/>Joe\u2019s wearing orange prison pants since his were ripped beyond repair, and Amber points out an outlet mall to him, and then a Joann\u2019s, suggesting they could make themselves costumes for the show..  Joe agrees. <br/><br/>They stop in a motel, and in the middle of the night Ruby leaves to go to the strange man\u2019s room.  Amber tells her not to go(, and gets a black stone, but aces the roll.)  She has her Epiphany:  \u201cYou know Ruby, I\u2019m sorry, I really should let you live your own life.  But you don\u2019t even know that guy.\u201d <br/>Ruby says she\u2019ll use protection, and goes to the guy\u2019s room, and Amber lets her.  (Amber is Done.)<br/><br/>She tells Joe she can\u2019t sleep and wants to work on their costumes.  Joe helps, (and after a lot of hints Joe\u2019s player says \u201cOh, I\u2019m supposed to quit my job and become a clothing designer?\u201d  \u201cA costume designer.\u201d) and realizes how much he enjoys it, and decides he\u2019s going to quit his job. <br/><br/>(Joe's player narrates a scene) After the concert, where he hand in his resignation to Uncle Kevin, who of course scoffs at his new life path.  (Joe is Done.)<br/><br/>The epilogue:  later, another Lady Gaga show.  Amber and Ruby and Dwight are there - Ruby and Dwight are now an item.  And Joe made their costumes.<br/><br/><br/>It was the first time my wife played and so it had some issues - it's hard to teach someone a game when they have to keep secret information from you, you don't know if they're playing it right or not and can't adjust.  Considering that, it turned out quite well.  Mark Nau's black stone mechanic might be a little brutal, but the game still turned out solid - don't think I'll change it for now.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
