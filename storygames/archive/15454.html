It's possible you've not gotten much response in spite of the enthusiasm around here for Danger Patrol because the most interesting Threats are those the players come up with!  At least in thematic terms.  We can't come up with anything more interesting for you and your players than those things you are excited about for the initial setup of the action arena + those Threats suggested by the "dangerous details" provided by your players in the moment.<br/><br/>I'll give you an example and follow with a couple things I've learned about Threats in Danger Patrol.<br/><br/>In my <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=12048&amp;page=1#Item_14" rel="nofollow">Schrodahedron</a> of Doom game one of the players was emphatic about a past relationship his character had with Princess Naalil.  These comments followed from some non-leading (I hope) questions I'd posed about the characters' context in the opening action scene.  Mystic Explorer Esssevian or "S-7" was a Danger Patrol hero who was also an emotionally damaged patient of Professor Borium.<br/><br/>Following the Suspense scenes, Danger Patrol navigated time and space in their pursuit of Plutonian villainy.  Some kind of disorientation following this journey suggested itself.  I have a base opposition economy in mind for any second Action scene and juice it with any fallout from the interstitial Suspense scene.  One of these "extra" Threats, then, came in the form of "The Anger Within S-7".  As with a Major Threat following a Total Disaster roll, I narrated that S-7 had to overcome the anger that the disorienting journey had provoked before he could address any of the more terrestrial threats in the arena (I made it a Normal Threat though).  The idea for this Threat came entirely from the player, his narration of Esssevian's instability and sadness over his forbidden love.  Danger Patrol is about listening.  The dangerous details provided by the players when they add danger dice train you to listen and then re-incorporate that input.  Later in the session!  Even when it doesn't arise directly from that mechanic!<br/><br/>In a case like this it doesn't matter whether you yourself are interested in the nature of the opposition.  The player will be.  <br/><br/>Some things I've learned about Threats:<br/><br/>1) Relative to the Bonus Dice and the number of Danger Dice, it doesn't much matter what Trait the player wants to use to attack a given Threat.  Say "Yes!" and roll with it.  The player might have suggested Detective or Professor to have Esssevian attack his anger.  I might have countered that it was kind of a Mouse Guard "Nature" roll and allowed him to roll "Explorer" to fight this internal conflict.  Go with whatever they want unless it's really a stretch. That's what they are interested in and you might get even more Threat grist out of that enthusiasm and their narration.  I understand John Harper isn't entirely satisfied with the lack of Trait differentiation in the Beta version of DP and I think I agree.  This free-and-easy nature arising out of the lack of differentiation between the Role niches is an interesting byproduct of the current version though.<br/><br/>2)  Countdowns!  You'll have read this elsewhere too I'm sure, but multiple simultaneous Threats with countdowns are key to increasing interest and excitement.  Right from the beginning of the scene.  You'll all be excited to learn which Threats the characters prioritize.  They'll roll a lot of Danger Dice in their hurry to attack multiple against-the-clock Threats and generate Disasters as a result.  Those disasters should arise from player input whenever possible, the dangers they added. <br/><br/>3) This final one took me a while to come to.  Apart from normal Threats like Crimson Apes, don't have most of the Threats be "monsters" with "hit points".  Sure, sometimes.  But more often I like to have my Major, Elite or Master Threats be what the baddie represented by that Threat is doing.  Don't just have Uldarr the Unfathomable or Grand Commander Kukov be a baddie out there with 9-12 hit points and when the heroes hit them often enough with combat Traits they are killed or knocked out.  Have the Threat be what Uldarr or Zukov is <i>doing</i>.  Right then.  With a countdown.  This does two things.<br/><br/>     a) It allows further flexibility in how the heroes are attacking the Threat.  Yes, your Flyboy or Agent Trait will work great to prevent the thing Uldarr is up to!  If the Commando on the team wants to help prevent the Threat by shooting Uldarr in the kneecap with his raygun that works great too.<br/><br/>     b) You have more flexibility in narrating the outcome of what happens when the Threat is overcome.  This is particularly important in the first Action Scene.  It's a matter of expectations.  If Uldarr is presented as a 4E monster with nine hitpoints then you've cheated them if, after chewing through those nine hits, he gets away.  If the Threat was "Uldarr's Mystic Meddling" as he seeks the Chronos Orb then maybe he escapes!  Maybe the heroes even convince him to give up his pursuit and he joins forces with them!  This flexibility should of course be used in the service of incorporating player input, not in robbing them of victory.  They are Danger Patrol heroes after all...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352224/#Comment_352224" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-22T01:19:45+00:00" title="December 22, 2011  1:19AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matthew, that's great advice.
