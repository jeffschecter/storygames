Some of the excitement wears off during the course of the thread as the details of the system emerged and then due to the game's cancellation by its original publisher.  But you can read all that if you choose to click through.<br/><br/>What's significant to me is how much creative energy some folks \u2014 like me, I'll freely admit \u2014 invest in the <i>Warhammer 40,000</i> universe.  Not just in the miniatures, which can be consuming all by themselves, but in the fictional setting that is, in a practical sense, totally unnecessary for the core game.  Games Workshop has put a great deal of time and effort into making that setting as richly detailed as possible while still preserving the core conceit: in the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war.<br/><br/>Recently I resurrected <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=5338" rel="nofollow">another old discussion</a>, this one about a group of players using <i>A Thousand and One Nights</i> to tell stories of the 41st Millennium.  The game sounds awesome and I encourage you to read that thread, even if it means you go away from this one for a little while.  Go ahead, I can wait.<br/><br/>:: intermission music ::<br/><br/>Anyway, the two discussions taken together set me to thinking about how we get our 40k on outside the confines of the miniatures game.  Some use the official system of <i>Dark Heresy</i> and <i>Rogue Trader</i>, of course, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that (I'd kill for a game), while others seek alternative venues.  So my question is: which camp do you fall into?  What game are you using to adventure in 40k's grim future?  Are you considering an alternative, but haven't come up with one yet?  What would a system have to have to get you playing 40k as a roleplaying setting?  What would you focus on in that setting?<br/><br/>So many questions.  I look forward to the answers.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246517/#Comment_246517" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-14T05:26:23+00:00" title="December 14, 2009  5:26AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am a huge 40K fan.I love Space Orks with a creepy intensity.

It's just perfect for telling stories about individuals here and there in the 40K setting. I even wrote an Oracle for it on Abulafia and would write more if I thought I would ever use them. My first oracle focused on heresy and humanity, but I think there's a lot of room for stories about the non-human races.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_246518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246518/#Comment_246518" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-14T05:29:40+00:00" title="December 14, 2009  5:29AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bret, I wonder if an Ork-specific and/or a Chaos-specific oracle would be the way to expand on what you've done already.

The show is set in the 40k universe, we are all playing members of the Imperial Guard invading a planet and trying to survive.  It's been a lot of fun, especially since everyone at the table is aware of the setting details, and we can reference various bits and pieces of fluff to the enjoyment of all. In terms of fluff, we focus on the Grim-Dark and really zero in on the utter hopelessness of us being Guardsmen, the lemmings of the 40k universe.  And yet we struggle against it, trying to survive against much larger and stronger xenos and creatures of chaos. <br/><br/>Dark Heresy is pretty awful. I mean, the concept of the game is being the Inquisitor's bitch, when by all rights you should be the Inquisitor.   I still remember a game store owner saying to a friend of mine "The great thing about Dark Heresy was that if the characters are in trouble, their boss the Inquisitor can come in and save them! Plus the GM gets his own character!" No thanks.  <br/><br/>The thing I really like about Primetime is the uncertainty of where the episode is going to go.  The structure of the game really lends itself to unexpected turns.<br/><br/>We also joked about that in addition to the Strong and Able mature rated live action show, there was a cartoon that was very much in the light hearted feel as GI-Joe episodes.  Here's the theme song:<br/><br/>Strong and Able!<br/>Fighting For You in the 40th Millenium!<br/>Strong and Able!<br/>Orks and Eldar, Xenos beware!<br/>Strong and Able!<br/>Fighting Chaos whenever it strikes!<br/>Strong and Able!<br/><br/>We'd sing it during commercial (bathroom) breaks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_246523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246523/#Comment_246523" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-14T05:40:04+00:00" title="December 14, 2009  5:40AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sam, I had an idea to do a series of Warhammer fantasy In a Wicked Age oracles, and I would do one for reach army.<br/><br/>With 40K I could probably do something similar, or do it more themed like the prepackaged IAWA ones and base them on theme.

When this 4E campaign is over, I might do that again or 3:16.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>What would a system have to have to get you playing 40k as a roleplaying setting? What would you focus on in that setting?</i><br/>\n<br/>\nIt'd have to capture the narrative feel given by the novels (especially as portrayed in the first three Horus Heresy novels) and, preferably, the ruleset should be compact (less than 128 pages or cheap enough every player can own one). Ergo, the actual Dark Heresy game, which I own, is out the window. PTA qualifies. I'd like to see what the next version can do for 40k RP.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe focus would either be Manifest Destiny (Imperium vs. Xeno, Eldar reclaiming a Maiden World) or Unification (Imperium + Eldar vs. Tyranid + Necron). I think they're two sides of the same coin.

We were basically doing Sorcerer and Sword and tacking on the psionics rules (treating psionics as Demons) from Jared's Schism mini-supplement.  It was a really fun game.  The Inquisitor's demon was his Psionics.  We also had a Mechanicus who had a xenos technological demon as part of his systems.  <br/><br/>It was a good story about a group that was trying to destory the golden throne so the emperor's body could die and be reborn.<br/><br/>I don't remember exactly how we played humanity.  I think we did a dual humanity and part of it was about being corrupted by chaos, and or handling or dealing with chaos type stuff.  I don't remember.  I know I had a thought later that it would be interested to define Humanity as orthodoxy (to the imperial cult and methods.) So the Inquisitor (or member of his retinue) who hit Humanity 0 would be declared a heretic whether actually corrupted by chaos or not.<br/><br/>I have been thinking more recently that it might be interesting to play an Inquisitor game using Dirty Secrets.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_246669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246669/#Comment_246669" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-14T17:08:59+00:00" title="December 14, 2009  5:08PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm currently designing a game called Vultures, which is a Necromunda lovechild.

I used the demons from Dread and ran a hunt in a Hive World. It was a good fit as the game was essentially about lousy punks trying to survive a demon infestation.

Ruling dynasties fight for dwindling resources to protect their families and their people. Sorcerers are the dudes who have armored power suits that let them use psionic abilities trained through the generations. Lore is Selfishness (for yourself, for those you love); Humanity is compassion for others, the ability to see the greater good of humanity, act on the needs of others not connected to you, forswearing or sacrificing your own needs or the needs of those closest to you for someone else.<br/><br/>Some sorcerers are called raptors, who use their lore to banish the psionic systems in the armor and kill other sorcerers in order to stop the struggles on the planet. <br/><br/>I'm seeing huge citadels, massive war machine factories, scarlet skies, big battles, battles between nobles, battles within dynasties and so on...<br/><br/>I realized I loved the armor and the images, but didn't want to learn all the material that I really know didley about (except SPACE HULK) which I've always loved.<br/><br/>I've got some folks interested in trying <i>Sorcerer</i>, so I whipped this up this setting so they'd have a sword &amp; sorcery, a modern day and a future SF setting to choose from.<br/><br/>I created up a five page PDF with stolen art to show to the players. <a href="http://playsorcerer.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/future-perfect.pdf" rel="nofollow">You can see it here.</a><br/><br/>I think the setting gets at least what <i>I like</i> about it... without all the -- you know -- EVERYTHING that might swamp me and my players going in cold. The genestealers are there in the form of mutated humans altered or controlled by psionics and sorcerers. I've got endless wars. Lots of factions. Dynastic struggle. <br/><br/>And, for me at least, I get the tension between protecting your own and protecting the earth as a whole. For me, that's where the characters aren't just foul -- they're just human. <br/><br/>My best friend Eric is a really good guy, so he often doesn't plug into <i>Sorcerer</i> characters right away. But in the last year he's fallen in love. Just got engaged. Crazy about her. He worries that something will happen to her -- because he never wants anything to happen to her.<br/><br/>When I was coming up with this setting (which he might play in) I thought of the phrase, "If you could save Christine, but you had to burn down the world to do it, would you burn down the world?"<br/><br/>I imagined him suddenly shuddering -- a good <i>Sorcerer</i> shudder, where you move from one option to the other very fast because they both make sense and you're not sure what to do. I thought, "This time he's not going to have any trouble plugging into the game."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249640/#Comment_249640" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-05T05:25:57+00:00" title="January  5, 2010  5:25AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Christopher, that's a really nice little document you put together.
