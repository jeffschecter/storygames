                    The point of applied theory is to consciously do things with a purpose.<br/><br/>We can apply gaming theory in two fora: design and play.<br/><br/>So what is theory in this regard? It's a framework for understanding the dynamics at play.  It consists of definitions, categories, and patterns that allow us to talk about what, why, and how things happen at the table. These frameworks are not "true" -- they are just more or less useful in understanding what's going on and predicting as well as helping to bring about certain events and dynamics.<br/><br/>First you understand, then you use that understanding to play or design with a purpose.<br/><br/>What's the alternative? Just play or design without clearly understanding what you're doing or why you're doing it (not in the abstract "because it's fun" way, but in detailed decision-by-decision patterns).  For some people, this is attractive for a variety of reasons.  Just like most people don't want to understand magicians' tricks or study literary or musical theory for fear of losing the magical enjoyment of the respective media.  That's a valid play preference.<br/><br/>But I believe in designing with a purpose, and I personally prefer playing with a purpose.<br/><br/>For play, once I understand what I enjoy and what dynamics enable me to play that way, I can focus on that and play with a purpose.  If my whole group does that, we've achieved a focus and intensity that I contend is near-impossible to attain without the understanding that underlies playing with a purpose.  It does take away some of the magic of the early days of my roleplaying, though, and I won't get that back, ever.<br/><br/>For design, once I understand how play dynamics work and which mechanics, rules, textual and optical elements, etc., support certain dynamics, I can design with a purpose.  My design will be more focused and will contain less white noise.  If this design is then used by a play group, I contend that the group will achieve a focus and intensity it would have a harder time achieving with a less-purposeful design (because the white noise gets in the way).<br/><br/>If you ask me about any aspect of one of my designs, if I did my job right, I'll be able to give you an answer that shows that I had a clear reason, one that ties into the dynamics of play that I want to encourage or enable.<br/><br/>Combine the two for a cumulative effect.<br/><br/>In conclusion: Whether or not you want to play with a purpose is a personal preference, and telling others that "they don't understand their own fun" shows a lack of understanding in itself.  But design with a purpose is the professional responsibility of any designer.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in all these discussions about "theorists" and "anti-theorists," this point of view might help to defuse and clear things up a bit.                </div>

                            Roger, <br/><br/>he would be a player. Can he play without knowing the underpinning? Sure. As I said above. Could he benefit from knowing all the game's rules, how team dynamics work, what the overall strategy is?  I'd think so.<br/><br/>He certainly knows his particular purpose, what he's after and how to achieve it.

I'm trying to reconcile this with 
<blockquote>The point of applied theory is to consciously do things with a purpose.</blockquote>
and
<blockquote>What's the alternative? Just play or design without clearly understanding what you're doing or why you're doing it.</blockquote>
It <i>seems</i> to me that our defensive linebacker has no inkling of the applied theory behind football, and yet has also avoided playing without clearly understanding what he's doing or why he's doing it.  <br/><br/>He's found a third way: conscious, purposeful play without applied theory.<br/><br/>I seem to have met numerous RPG players who similarly also achieve exactly the same thing.<br/><br/>Is there something I'm not understanding here?<br/><br/><br/>Cheeers,<br/>Roger                        </div>

                            Hmmm.  I'm not so sure.<br/><br/>I mean, yeah, he understands <i>that one game ruleset</i> really well, probably.  But does he understand, on a theoretical level, the structures and theories of football games as a class?<br/><br/>Has he studied the CFL and the NFL and the XFL?  Has he considered the repercussions of different ball sizes, wider and narrower fields, different rules about how and when points are scored when, say, a field goal is missed?<br/><br/>Maybe he has.  But I suspect it's as likely that he hasn't.  (As an aside, the guys who design and write and re-write the rules for these sorts of things -- what sorts of blocks are allowed, what sorts of calls can be challenged, even things like salary caps and league structure -- I have no doubt that those guys have the theory side of things down cold.)<br/><br/>Similarly, there are DMs out there who understand one game -- D&amp;D, say -- really really well.  They know the rules inside and out.  They can play that system like a fiddle all day long.  But they haven't sat down and considered its theoretical underpinnings, and compared it against Call of Cthulhu and Paranoia and HeroQuest to examine how all the parts fit together.<br/><br/>That's how I see this metaphor shaking out, anyway.                        </div>

                            Graham,<br/><br/>Say we have a coach who happens to have a lot of experience, and a coach with the same experience who also understands all the fineries of the rules, the dynamics in play, the physics of throws, arcs and catches, the psychological underpinning of calling time outs to throw off the other team, etc.<br/><br/>Coach A might be as effective as coach B, out of intuition.  But I think it's very unlikely.<br/><br/>So yeah, sure, a roleplayer (to get back to the actual topic) who plays instinctively and doesn't want to look into the theory can focus on all the good stuff out of gut instincts.

I never said it wasn't.<br/><br/>However, as Josh says: if the person recognizes patterns of what s/he likes and seeks those out consciously, that's applying theory.  Once you analyze and understand your play on a conscious level, you're entering practical theory territory.<br/><br/>Please recognize, once again, that I'm not saying that playing with a defined purpose is superior than playing without.

                            Roger, you are mistaking the book for the game.  An experienced DM, even if he's only ever played D&amp;D for years upon years, has years upon years of experience with many different games of D&amp;D.  That they came out of a single book is irrelevant.  If he abstracts from prior experience and applies that abstraction to current play, he's practicing theoretical thinking.                        </div>

Maybe he's right, maybe not; maybe you're right, maybe not.  But I think we can agree that these definitions are not interchangeable, and may be mutually exclusive.                        </div>

Beaten to the punch by 28 seconds.  Curse you, BishopRoby!<br/><br/>In addition to tacking on an amen, though:
<ol>
<li>This has been where I'm coming from in other threads, where I think I've come off as merely combative.  I don't know how widely recognized this idea is.  It seems to me that there are people who propone that there is no theory but The Theory, whichever that Theory happens to be.</li>
<li>Referring to the original post, I begin to think more and more that there's room for parallel, related but separate theories, distinguished by purpose.  More and more I see sections of the Big Model as diagnostic, but certainly directed at play.  It seems to me that there would be use to developing theory that was decidedly directed at design.  And of course my own hobby horse: a critical theory.</li>

Okay, so now we find the root of the problem.  Graham, come on.  David Beckham plays <em>soccer</em>.  I'm sure if you review the thread in the light of the <em>proper</em> meaning of football, everything will become clear.                        </div>

                            Graham,<br/><br/>Could you tell me what you think "football theory" actually is?  Beckham absolutely understands the game, and every move he makes is conscious.  He knows his reason for playing--to win--and he knows which techniques in which situations are most likely to contribute to this purpose.<br/><br/>Also, since you brought it up: is football a creative endeavor like roleplaying?  The analogy might just be not working out that well because sports are not group creative activities.                        </div>

AND THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE DON'T DEFINE OUR TERMS!<br/><br/>Anyway. This is interesting. Let's see if we can reach some common ground.<br/><br/>Christian, I agree with much of what you're saying: I prefer to play and design with a purpose. I generally like theory discussions.<br/><br/>However, I also think that there's value in <i>ignoring</i> theory and trusting intuition. I think this is the case in most artistic pursuits: the Rolling Stones wrote great songs without knowing music theory; Jack Kerouac types without understanding literary criticism; and, when David Beckham curls the ball into the top corner of the goal, he doesn't quite understand the physics (if he stopped to think about it, he'd miss).<br/><br/>That's not to say that theory is valueless: just to say that, occasionally, it can hamper creativity. Sometimes, when I'm designing a game, I don't want to design for a purpose: I want to design for fun. Later on, I'll think about the theory.<br/><br/>Could you agree with me that it's sometimes good to design (or play) <i>without</i> thinking about theory: because it frees you to be more creative? And that some people <i>prefer</i> not to think about theory, because they find it hampers their creativity?<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Here's a part of my original post:<br/><br/><i>Just play or design without clearly understanding what you're doing or why you're doing it (not in the abstract "because it's fun" way, but in detailed decision-by-decision patterns). For some people, this is attractive for a variety of reasons. Just like most people don't want to understand magicians' tricks or study literary or musical theory for fear of losing the magical enjoyment of the respective media. That's a valid play preference.</i><br/><br/>And then I wrote:<br/><br/><i>Please recognize, once again, that I'm not saying that playing with a defined purpose is superior than playing without. They're two equally valid preferences.</i><br/><br/>So yeah.  We can agree for the play part.  For the design part?  I have yet to see a non-purposeful design that persuaded me that it was worthwhile.  What I see are bits and pieces people have leftover from the designs that influenced them getting stuck in otherwise innovative designs.  Heartbreakers with good special ideas but too much baggage.<br/><br/>I don't think you can even begin to creatively design before you free yourself from the trappings of traditional design, and I'm not sure you can do that without analyzing RPGs as a dynamic social activity first.<br/><br/>Imagine someone who gets into RPGs through Vampire.  Now he sets out to design his own game.  If he doesn't reflect on what the activity actually is and how rules facilitate that, I'm afraid his design will have a lot of Vampire's trappings.<br/><br/>There might be people who can just burst out with innovative things without thinking about RPGs on that deeper level first, but I haven't seen that happen, and I'm not sure where that'd come from.  Maybe from people who've never played RPGs before?                        </div>

                            When I was in art school I had a freind who was a neo ab-ex guy. He insisted that there was nothing to be gained for the artist by trying to engage art intellectually, you could only do it with your gut.  I disagreed.  I think it's both.<br/>
<br/>
Instinct always plays a big part.  I see people talk about this and I sometimes perceive a message that they think people who think systematically about rpgs do so when they are playing.  My freind asked me if I thought about what I painted while I was painting it.  I said "not really.  Maybe a little in the spaces when I'm not actually doing it."  But engaging my concious brain with my art did inform the art process<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I'm trying to say is that I've found theory valuable because once I absorb it, it becomes a part of my unconcious experience.  I don't think of it while playing but I beleive that on an unconcious level it helps me play better.<br/>
<br/>
When I teach people how to paint we necessarily have to talk not only technique but about ideas.  I always tell them it will feel awkward at first, conciously trying to practice what they've been taught.  But at some level of practice it becomes unconcious, then they can be lost in the flow of painting again.                        </div>

Totally. I think most artistic development follows this pattern: <br><br>1. You do whatever-it-is (in my case, scenic painting, 2D drawing) out of interest or desire. Maybe you have some talent, maybe you have a lot of talent, whatever.<br><br>2. You get some training (in my case, undergraduate level courses). You learn technique and, dare I say it, theory (perspective, color theory, proportion, etc). It's hard, because you're learning new stuff, you're learning new ways to think about your activity, and you're trying to make the stuff in your head have something to do with what you're doing on paper. You may actually start doing whatever-it-is <i>worse</i>, because you worry or think about all the theory and technique stuff, where before you just did it.<br><br>3. You practice, you learn, and you absorb the material. It becomes part of how you approach the activity, and now your level of talent, whatever it is, in supported by what you've learned from your critical thought about the activity. You've synthesized, and your output is better than in 1 and 2.<br/><br/>This is basically how I feel I have developed since I started critically thinking about playing RPGs. I think the addition of the social element of the activity adds nuances to the process, but it's a fundementally similar, if not the same, basic track.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Instinct is merely internalised experience.  I rely heavily on instinct, I don't kid myself that it comes magically from nowhere though, my reliable instincts come from experience and my most reliable instincts from understood experience.<br/><br/>Anti-theory in the other threads is merely shorthand for people opposed to GNS theory, many of them are active proponents of other theories.  There are people who are opposed to any theory or the very concept of theory, but I think that has relatively little to do with the merits or otherwise of any given theory under discussion.<br/><br/>Otherwise, Nathan summarises things well.  It goes like this:<br/><br/>Unconcsious incompetence.  You're shit, and you don't know it.<br/><br/>Conscious incompetence.  You're still shit, but now you know you are.  Ouch.<br/><br/>Conscious competence.  You can be not shit, but you have to think about it in order not to be.  Ouch again.<br/><br/>Unconscious competence.  You're not shit and you don't need to think about it anymore.<br/><br/>Stages two and three are pretty painful, but this is a commonly recognised learning model for a wide range of activities.  I see no reason to think this doesn't apply to roleplaying.  If theory helps you get to stage three or four, go for it.                        </div>

                            Game design has a craft to it, just like any other art.  Yes, you can get by with innate talent, but if you want to get really good, it requires practice and knowledge (i.e. theory) - both of which hone natural talent and can substitute for it.<br/><br/>Saying that a game designer doesn't need theory is like saying that visual artists don't need to study anatomy or perspective.  You don't, necessarily - but either a) you're going to have to take the long, hard road to learn to draw figuratively; or b) your art will always be near the same groove you start it.                        </div>

It was <b>hard</b> to go from unconscious competence ("I know what I'm doing, just don't ask me how I know it!") to conscious incompetence ("I thought I knew what I was doing, but I couldn't explain it") on the way to conscious competence ("I know what I'm doing ... ask me how I know it!")  I did it because, for me, I'd hit a wall in terms of how far I could develop unconsciously.  I just wasn't getting better, and I wanted to.

                            Works for me Joshua.<br/><br/>The only thing I'd add is that plainly for some people theory is a valid tool for moving up the rungs.  Others, for whatever reason, find it less helpful and have to rely on other tools to help them move on up (and it may be worth explaining the theory to those folk, as some may be finding it less helpful because they don't understand it properly or how it relates to them).  And of course some others deny there's a ladder in the first place, but they're wrong.                        </div>

                            At a whack, theory appeals and works for us verbal and linguistic learners most.  We like reading and talking about theory.  We post and read long, long, long threads and have fun doing it.<br/>
<br/>
The pretty models and clever diagrams that theory tends to turn out appeals for the visual thinkers (I'm thinking especially of John Harper's keen illos here), but there aren't very many of these, and I think a lot of visual learners just aren't engaged.<br/>
<br/>
The kinesthetic learners (the largest group) learn by doing, and so theory is close to useless for them -- although actual play experiences go a long way to showing them the theory in concrete terms.  My wife is totally kinesthetic, has zero interest in theory, but loves innovative games that take cues from theory.                        </div>

                            Joshua, again that works for me.  I think those distinctions are good ones and help explain why some people find theory useful while others don't.<br/><br/>I mean, those aren't the only reasons, but I think they are powerful ones.<br/><br/>So, if that's so is there a better way of reaching out to the visual and kinesthetic guys?  Is this where the Forge booth emphasis on actual play demos comes into its own, taking the products of theory and showing people how to apply by doing rather than talking?                        </div>

                            I think so, Max.  It's one of the reasons why I run a full slate of indie titles at every local con I can get to.  Having people <em>do</em> it is far more effective than trying to explain it to them.  GO PLAY and all that. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>
