                    I've got an idea on how to use Conflict Resolution for immersionists.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, dig on this, like in Enemy Gods, you are playing both a hero and a diety in that hero's pantheon.  When it comes time for a conflict, you put aside the hero for a moment and take up the role of a diety and two dieties, one of the player's choice who initiated the conflict and another of the GM's choice.<br/>
<br/>
So, stakes setting is part of the god and goddess' role-playing and they do so with their own petty and capricious goals in mind.                </div>

                            I can't remember where I read this, but I quite like the conceit. Dunno how well it would work in practice, however.<br/><br/>You've all seen <i>Serenity</i>, right? That kinda Western-style of talking, and the bit where Mal goes "This is how it is. Anybody doesn't wanna fly with me anymore..." Somebody suggested using a key phrase as an IC-Stake setting device (I guess it would work best for things like Dogs, but hey).<br/><br/>For example:<br/>"Here's how it's gonna be: You, brother, are gonna give up your sinnin' ways." Stakes: Does he repent?<br/><br/>"Here's how it's gonna be: We're comin' for you boy, if you like it or not! Ain't no hiding going stop us!" Stakes: Do the Dogs track down and encounter the character who this was directed to?<br/><br/>Thinks... isn't this kinda-sorta how the key phrases in Polaris work with regards to Stakes?                        </div>

                            Judd, the problem with that idea is that ANY time you "put away the hero" you risk breaking immersion.<br/>

How different is it, to put away the hero and take up the god, than it is to put away the hero and take up the director?                        </div>

                            Nice try Judd, but no dice. It's an interesting way to have conflict resolution, but it breaks immersion into tiny tiny pieces.<br/><br/>So you're playing a character. If you're an immersionist, you are the character (to a degree). Now, in general, to stay immersed you'd have to keep being the character.<br/><br/>Conflict comes up. To face it while maintaining immersion you'd have to keep being the character (note that this is subtly different then being "in character" or "Inplay", depending on finicky definitions). Any mechanics which force you to step to the meta level and make tactical/strategic decisions breaks your immersion, because you have to evaluate your character from the outside. What you suggest is even worse, because it forces you completely out of your character <i>and into another one</i>.<br/><br/>Tiny, tiny pieces on the floor is all that would be left of your immersion in that character.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><br/>Warren - that's actually pretty neat. I don't see any reason why it shouldn't work. Has nothing to do with conflict resolution, though <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>

I wonder how it would work in play, especially since sometimes the stakes are unstated.                        </div>

                            Why doesn't it have anything to do with conflict resolution?<br/>
<br/>
As I see it, Conflict Resolution requires 1) A desire for a certain outcome and 2) Resistance to that outcome (Say Yes or Roll Dice). The "immersion" problem seems to be that 1) should be a player desire, and as such is normally specified out-of-character, which breaks immersion.<br/>
<br/>
This trick basically allows the player to use his character as a mouthpiece for his desires without having to (technically) go out of character, and as such, should allow Conflict Resolution without breaking immersion.<br/>
<br/>
Am I not getting something?<br/>
<br/>
(Vaxalon - Fred, IIRC?) I never have unstated stakes in Dogs, so I think this would work OK with them. Where it might fall apart if in games which require counterstakes to be set and agreed. I'm not sure how you can get a significant amount of stakes negotation to happen smoothly IC - except for the Polaris model, perhaps?                        </div>

                            Warren  - you're not really getting immersion.<br/>
<br/>
Immersionists are not actors that don't want to "break character", for whom your suggestion would be excellent. Immersionists strive to "become" their characters, to change their perspective to theirs and to make all decisions from "within them" (this phrase is inaccurate).<br/>
<br/>
To force them to use a specific set of phrases means that comes the time to have conflict (something that immersionists don't seperate from free-play, because that would break immersion) they have to step out of their characters and pick from within that set of phrases. It's an improvement over other systems in that interruption of immersion is limited and thus easier to ignore, but it's still an interruption.<br/>
<br/>
To be honest, I'm not sure immersionists need a conflict system as elaborate as use-of-phrases would suggest.<br/>
<br/>
(Disclaimer - I am not the Grand Guru of Immersion, and feel ratehr uneasy making sweeping statements about it. I've only been practicing one type of it for ten years or so)                        </div>

                            Fair enough. I've always associated Immersionist = Strong Actor Stance until now. I still don't think that one "I want this to happen" key phrase would require much stepping out of character (EDIT: or much reaching 'beyond' the character - I assume Immersionists are happy to go "I really want Evil Bob dead" or "I have to warn the village before the Orcs get there" if they felt that it came from thier character)  - compared to your typical Task-oriented combat system (say) would require, but I'm happy to concede that I don't really know much about this kind of thing.<br/>

                            Tony - I think it could work. It's more ritual then I like in my gaming, but I can see how it can be done while maintaining immersion (also - it's wicked cool).<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that you'd have a hard time convincing immersionists that they have to do this every time they want to do something, or every time the GM wants to oppose them. In effect you'd only be able to do it rather rarely.<br/>
<br/>
The immersive gameplay usually doesn't usually have "official" stake setting as such, because both the characters' "wants" and the opposition to it should flow naturally from the SIS. This is a bad explanation, but I'm having a hard time articulating this.                        </div>

Just to agree with you, if one is immersing yourself into a character, why can't that character have certain 'key phrases'?<br/>
<br/>
I don't get it either.<br/>

                            I think so, too, Brand.  I mean, according to this misinterpretation of fragile immersionism, literally every time the player reaches for the dice, cards, tarot etc the immersion is broken.<br/><br/>"I swing my sword at them" [rolls] ('task") isn't any less immersion-breaking than "I vow on my here sword to rout these three bandits" [roll] ("conflict"). It's just that, after the dice hit the table, there's a little more interpretation and story to fill in with conflict resolution.<br/><br/>How that happens is the key to if it breaks "immersionism" or not.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            One point that hasn't been brought up is that the stakes of a conflict may not always be what the fictional characters involved <em>want</em>.<br/><br/>If I'm doing some hella cool immersive play with a teenager in high school, the only thing I <em>want</em> is to be left the hell alone to hang with my friends and experiment with mind-altering substances.  I <em>want</em> my world to be as completely free of authority figures and requirements on my time and energy as possible.  But if I got that, there's no game.<br/><br/>Isn't one of the responsibilities of an immersion-supporting GM to offer resistence and adversity that the immersion-player wants but cannot ask for without breaking immersion?<br/><br/>On a tangential note, I don't think breaking immersion is necessary a deal-breaker.  It's breaking immersion <em>too often</em> that's what kills the mood.                        </div>

<i>"Part of the problem, I think, is that Immersion is a big, big word and everyone who talks about it is usually talking about a small, small part."</i><br/><br/>That's 100% correct, Brand. There's a tendency to treat immersion like it's a single term, and it's not. It contains the state, the personal skills involved, the process of play, and a lot of other things. Unfortunately there isn't any comprehensive study/analysis of immersion in English (there is one in Hebrew, but it's in piecemeal, and I understand there's one in Swedish or Finnish or one of those) to point to. I think this is mainly because Americans are not immersionists (and yeah, that's a sucky term too. Another thread).<br/><br/>Andy - both things you mention are interruptions. The immersive process (I say as if there's just one) is designed to handle some interruptions - players snap out of character, and then snap back in. It's the nature, manner and frequency of these interruptions that determines how much they affect the overall experience ("immersion", or at least one of them).<br/><br/>In fact, what and how many interruptions they can "soak" is the main characteristic that seperates immersive processes from each other.<br/><br/>General Statement - I don't think immersion can be explained to the point of being understood. It has to be demonstrated or experienced (preferably both). We can break processes down all day, but I don't think it'll get us any significant progress without all sides groking the concept.                        </div>

                            I have a counter-question. Why do people who find immersion toxic and confusing and such really care? I mean this seriously: I've accepted, for instance, that I don't much get narrativism and insofar as I do get the concepts I neither believe in them nor wish to use them in my play...so I don't. I don't put any more effort into it, and instead focus on what seems more likely to help my games at the moment. If I find later something I'd like to draw on, well, then I'll deal with it. But there seems to be this subtext of "we must either assimilate or defeat it", and I guess I just don't get the point.<br/><br/>Admittedly, I want someone to be writing more cool simulationist games in genres I want, but that's a side issue.                        </div>

<p>My take is that Immersionism is a tool.  It is a tool whose uses I do not understand.  It's like I bought a great big standard toolkit, and I got the hammer and the drill and the circular saw and the flexelgrabbit.  And damn if I don't here people saying "Sure man, dry-wall is great, but you totally can't use a flexelgrabbit with it."</p>
<p>It's not that I can't do what I want with the other tools ... but there's this damn flexelgrabbit in my toolkit, all chrome and rubber and ... my God ... thingies.  I'm deathly curious about the darn thing.  I want to know what it's used for.</p>
<p>Maybe I would benefit if I knew how to use it, and I just don't know it yet.</p>

                            I suspect, Tony, that the real answer is "It does things you don't want to do." A friend of mine says that it's like explaining the varieties of nipple clamp to someone who isn't wanting to engage in BDSM. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Here's my own take...<br/><br/>There are times when I like to focus on the creation of the story as a human-scale process. I feel at my best in that regard with PBEM, where I have the time to ponder, we can talk explicitly about drafts and revisions, and so on. Trying to do it seriously in real time doesn't much appeal to me, but I can understand real-time play that is focused on narrative building and thematic engagement as a different way to the same general kind of satisfaction. (It's like preferring one kind of salsa over another, but agreeing that the right salsa makes even the best, freshest-baked tortilla chip a better snack.)<br/><br/>But other times I'm after a very different experience. What I want is the sense of <i>being there</i>, feeling and thinking differently than I do in real life, experiencing a milieu not my own, and letting that life unfurl with as much surprise and mystery as my real life does. It's not that I'll never again want to be a craftsman approaching my work from the outside, focusing on the community of artists working together. It's just that in these times, it's the sense of being in the art that matters more to me. <br/><br/>Now, not everybody ever feels that desire, and it's not (I don't think) a defect of character. It's just one of those things that some people have and some don't. Furthermore, of those who do, not everyone gets at it the same way, just as (I realized) I was getting a fair amount of the satisfaction of narrativist play as explained by its happy advocates as I do through quite different means of collaboration. Maybe you get that sense of "I'm there" through another medium - immersion happens for some people with film and TV, and for that matter with some musicians. The cliche of the foppish conductor or performer who loses all awareness of the world is anchored in reality. For that matter, my friend mentioned above says that at least some BDSM practitioners get the ecstatic trance via bondage. <br/><br/>If you don't feel any particular yearning for that sensation experienced in the midst of real-time play with others, then probably immersion has little to offer you.                        </div>

<p>I'm just not really sure why these feelings are mutually exclusive, honestly, and the strident immersionist attitude that they <em>are,</em> without any evidence that this is true, is off-putting. In my own experience, I can easily get the "being there" sensation and still be making deliberate crafting decisions and mechanica optimisations.</p>
<p>When someone says that they can't balance, or don't want to balance, these three factors, it destroys my ability to use techniques that make games interesting for me, and furthermore it closes off avenues of communication that I need to use to ensure that the game is fun for me and everyone else.</p>

                            Shreyas, I don't know of any way to let you into my head, or anyone else's. I don't think many serious fans of immersive play would want to make a bolder statement than "I find these in antagonism in my experience." If you don't, then you are fortunate - and I do <i>not</i> mean that sarcastically. But the fact is that many of us know from experience, including a lot of ultimately frustrating experimentation and trial with the best of will, that we do. <br/><br/>So the kind of game that a lot of folks who say they want immersive play is not for you. Which is no more of a problem, it seems to me, than some games you really like not being for them. We are still agreeing that the uber-category of roleplaying plus story games plus all the neat stuff around it can satisfy multiple, independent, and sometimes simply not compatible aims, right? If this one isn't for you, or that one isn't for me, that only affirms that the audience of players and creators is broader than any one person's tastes, and I've always taken that as a fundamental postulate.                        </div>

<p>Put another way: "Because 'you don't have to deal with it' is not as good an answer as 'here is how to use it in a way that makes <em>your</em> gaming more fun'."</p>
<p>The way immersion is discussed, to my perception, is all former and no latter, and the former statement is worse than hostile, it's apathetic.</p>

                            Er, no, or at least not by intent. A lot of immersive players reject mechanics that they find conflicting with their sense of character engagement <i>because they tried them and found them conflicting with their sense of character engagement</i>, and what they wanted for that play was the character engagement. <br/><br/>But I'll leave this alone before I say something I'd genuinely regret. I'm sorry you don't believe me, and I can't think of any other words to convey a deep-felt experience in. To me that would be a sign that I'm not the right one to address an audience, but that's me.                        </div>

                            About Judd &amp; Tony's examples: I'm not sure how they'd work for immersion, but I think they're both pretty cool.<br/><br/>Josh has the role of an immersion-supporting GM/worldbuilder/designer exactly: <i>to offer resistence and adversity that the immersion-player wants but cannot ask for without breaking immersion</i>. Well, maybe not for all immersion--maybe someone out there wants to roleplay tilling the fields, feeding the pigs, and counting the beans--and maybe they don't see all that as resistence and adversity--but, yeah.<br/><br/>(With a little note that we're talking about immersion in realtime. I mean, if the player says "Give me a world with castles to storm", and the GM does so, then most immersion-loving players are going to be cool with it. It's not like immersionists want to step into a VR machine set to "random" and find themselves incarnated in a world they had no say in.)<br/><br/>Anyway, Judd's idea also reminds me of <i>The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind</i>, which I haven't read, and may be hoohah, but which sounds kind of neat as a premise.                        </div>

                            May I link (again) my "Active Exploits review":http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/11/11964.phtml? Or at least quote the end:<br/>

bq. Perhaps your players seeking something like this: a straight-forward task resolution mechanic, with room for rewarding positive player behavior; a system that doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t interfere with a successful social-dynamic with centralized trust/authority with the GM; transparent mechanics that get out of the way, and leave room for the players and GM to drive the story. And finally, a desire to dampen the less desirable outcomes of random chance.<br/>
<br/>
I basically suggested AE as a game that _could_ be immersion-supporting if you wanted. I feel that immersion-supporting rules probably:<br/>
<br/>
* don't get in the way of the player/character's head when making in-character decisions or actions. (Meta-mechanics that go to the OOC-GM should be okay, right?)<br/>
* generally feel "transparent". (This is an aesthetical judgement, just like I feel like Dust Devils is more "light" feeling than Dogs.)                        </div>

                            I've not yet been able to actually run AE, but nothing in it tripped my "this would bug me badly" switch. On the other hand, I feel that way about the Mind's Eye Theatre rules and have had some kickass wonderfully immersive play with it - to the extent that some folks who met me first in games with a particular character of mine came away thinking I was significantly taller, leaner, and balder than I am, just because the character came out that vividly - and yet some of my good friends stumble badly over it.<br/><br/>It's not so much that immersive play is innately fragile, I don't think, as that it can be highly individualized. Brand noted as much above, and I agree a lot with him. It's...<br/><br/>Okay, analogy time. There's a range of shades on the border between what nearly everyone would call blue and what nearly everyone would call purple. About as bright as royal blue, but different tint. (Signed, Too Lazy To Go Look Up Proper Color Tints.) I see them as purple. Gradually I realized that most folks see them as blue. They still feel purple to me, but I can point at one and refer to "that shade of blue" and more of the people I talk with agree that it is a shade of blue than not, by a wide margin.<br/><br/>What makes for immersive play is sometimes that subjective.                        </div>

                            Bruce, I don't believe in immersion. I am an immersion atheist. You will not convince me that it exists. It's like when people talk about religious experiences--I think that perhaps they ate something strange or aren't very in touch with themselves. Actually, it's even worse than that, because God isn't there for me to believe or disbelieve. In a roleplaying game I look around the table and see my friends with character sheets and dice in front of them, and I simply don't see how anyone can tune that out and <b>be</b> their character. Sure, I've been 'into' the game to the point where time dilates, but it's not the same thing, according to the cultists. I am truly not trying to be offensive; it's just that it seems to me that this by its very nature is not subject to analysis.<br/>
<br/>
In all the discussions I've seen of 'immersion', the one common factor is mysticism. 'I can't explain it to you, it's just something that happens.' 'You know it when you feel it.' 'I reach a trance-state.'<br/>
<br/>
I don't think anybody can design for this. It's like trying to shoot a tiny, moving target that turns invisible when you aim at it.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing that appears to make most self-styled immersionists happy is a smooth task-res system with minimal 'metagaming' and a setting ripe for exploration. If I were any sort of designer, I'd be looking at doing the next BRP or Unisystem if aiming at these people. Forget innovation, perfect the traditional, expect resistance.                        </div>

                            Immersion is one of those areas, like the low-impact mechanics stuff that we're currently discussing in the Collaboration-Competition thread (and derailing Jess' original point in doing it), that hasn't seen much design support in America (though apparently there's been a ton of work done in Scandinavia) and the people who've been really into it have traditionally sorta done it on their own, without design support and sometimes with design elements in place that actively work against their play goals.  Personally, I'd love to see a few games designed with immersion clearly in mind, to the point that it would help people who aren't really into it discover some benefits or expand their comfort zone into new play styles.  I remain optimistic that this is quite possible.  But then, that's just the kind of person I am.                        </div>

                            Thinking about this and the discussion about personal skills elsewhere (and trying not to be offensive):<br>
<br>
Every time the immersion debate comes up I'm made very aware that it is always about the experience of the players, not of the GM.  With traditonal style games, the GM just can't do that immersive thing in the same way, because (s)he has to be continuously organizing, ordering, rules-managing, etc.<br>
<br>
And yet, I feel like I immerse in characters--both when I GM, and when I play.  In fact I don't see much difference.  It's just that I don't get distracted by the other things.  I can structure, pay attention to players, rules monkey, dip down into a character, and then come back out again.<br/>
<br/>
I'm really not sure if the way I play, if what I feel, is the same thing that "immersivists" feel, but what I do know is that the practice of GMing for decades, plus a certain facility with games systems, means that I can't differentiate modes.<br/>
<br/>
Given that, I wonder whether it is not that dealing with system, etc., breaks immersion, but rather that the ability to do both comes with practice.  If you always have the luxury of someone handling the rules for you, of course contact with the rules is going to be jarring.  And if you haven't practiced with certain sorts of rules--as opposed to those you have naturalized--well, ditto.<br/>
<br/>
Not to point fingers, but if you can pretend the big bearded guy whose fingers are coloured orange from eating cheetos is an elven princess, maybe the system will disappear if you practice enough with it.  <br/>
<br/>
Or maybe not.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            "Bruce, I don't believe in immersion. I am an immersion atheist. You will not convince me that it exists. It's like when people talk about religious experiences--I think that perhaps they ate something strange or aren't very in touch with themselves. Actually, it's even worse than that, because God isn't there for me to believe or disbelieve."<br/><br/>I'm sort of curious how many folks here would find that a very welcome environment were it their thing on the skewer. But I'm curious how the process of my father's getting fitted up for long-term care after a hospitalization-requiring bout of pneumonia is going, and whether in fact he has Parkinson's and his last doctor carelessly brushed past MOm's concerns about it, and...it's not fun. It's not fun to be around. It's not fun to be on the defensive about, wondering when the next ambush might be coming. I'm in the wrong place, just as I rather feared and expected - the little bits of good stuff are not worth the nastiness or the wariness working in an alien mindset calls for.<br/><br/>Andy, thanks for the hospitality, and maybe I'll try it again when I've got less mortality on my mind. When my conversations with Mom have to focus on "here's what we have to do to change our vacation plans now that Dad can no longer leave him for an extended trip, and what we'll do if he's still alive for this holiday and that", I'm just too shot for it. I was hoping to learn, but mostly what I've learned is that I'm too weary to communicate to my own standard, and not making sense to very many people.                        </div>

                            Jebus.<br/><br/>And folks wonder why people get all defensive around this subject. <br/><br/>Has it ever occured to any of us (on either side) that maybe the reason folks on the other side don't want to talk about it with us is because we're being unpleasent? Because we're refusing to try and meet them halfway and trying to make them come all the way to us? <br/><br/>I worked in religious studies in my undergrad time, and I got very good at dealing with folks who believed very different things than I did. Folks who also were often not educated (at least in the western academic definition of the word) and so couldn't be expected to bring things to me in intellectual jargon mode. There are skills you can learn, however, that will let you understand what the other person is saying in their own mode. <br/><br/>The first step towards building those skills is to understand that when someone is engaging on a different level than you, it does not mean they are being stubborn, incapable, or obfuscatory. It just means that they are not able to engage with the material at hand in language in the same way you are. Much of the time they are giving you lots of information, but because you aren't actually listening for it all you hear is obstruction and judgement.<br/><br/>RIght now we've got a tribal culture and western academics talking to each other. The academics keep getting pissed off because the tribals won't say things like "we worship the goddess of disease because she reminds us of the liminal nature of the divine, and in setting up a paradigm where...." and the tribals are getting pissed off because the academics keep refering to them as "ignorant savages who can't even explain what they believe."                        </div>

                            Droog, I'll take up some of the slack. I've got a <a href="http://ewilen.livejournal.com/tag/immersion" rel="nofollow">tag on my livejournal</a> for immersion that might be interesting reading (or not). But here, in a nutshell. I have to preface with my own self-evaluation as "mild immersionist" and "I like it but I can also enjoy non-immersive play".<br/><br/>Basically, for me, the kernel of immersion is the gamist/simulationist hybrid that's found in board wargaming. While it's not true of all wargames, there's a definite strain in wargame development toward attempting to represent the experiential impact of standing at a particular level of command and responsibility. E.g., while early wargames gave you control over all your pieces, and full view of the board, later wargames increasingly attempted to represent the difficulties of "fog of war" and "command and control" which shape and hinder decisionmaking. At some scales (especially where politics or diplomacy were a factor), there were also attempts to represent motivational issues--such as offering "victory points" for achieving national or personal objectives.<br/><br/>Simulation in these games thus was not merely a matter of having events play out in an historically-plausible manner, but in reproducing the dynamics of the situation from the perspective of a specific person, or small group of people with a common goal. "Immersion" for the American player in a strategic representation of WWII would thus be supported by rules which created uncertainty in his mind regarding German development of the A-bomb, as his anxiety over that possibility would motivate him to finance the Manhattan project. "Immersion" would be harmed by a rule which put a card in the American's hand which gave him the option of <i>either</i>building an army corps <i>or</i> causing the revolt of a Nazi satellite state--because while that might be an interesting decision from a game perspective, it's not a choice that Roosevelt or Marshall could have personally faced.<br/><br/>This esthetic carries over to RPGs as an interest in placing oneself in the role of the character by inflicting on oneself an approximation of the constraints on knowledge and action that affect tthe character. It's easiest to do this in a gamist environment (i.e., where the point of the game is to win). But can also be found in more explorative contexts, in the pursuit of more open-ended goals and broader types of decisions. In the latter case, motivational factors may be modelled.<br/><br/>A narrow example would be the wargame/RPG hybrid <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/2976" rel="nofollow">Men Against Fire</a>, which takes as its premise the claim that only a minority of American front-line soldiers in WWII fired their weapons. So the game poses the question, if you've been ordered to attack an enemy pillbox, and you've got a few other GI's with you <i>but you only know about your own willingness to pull the trigger</i>, how does it feel trying to coordinate (or avoid) combat?<br/><br/>In a more standard RPG context, the idea would be to find ways to make your interests or values, with regard to the character and its place in the imagined world, match those of the character. Then combine that with Actor-stance limitations on action and knowledge, with the ultimate goal of creating the impression of "first person" insight into the character and his environment.                        </div>

                            You know, Eliot, I never understood anything about immersion when people talked about being the character or getting into the character or thinking like the character -- but your phrasing it as "attempting to simulate the same constraints on decision-making" makes a whole lot of sense to me.                        </div>

                            I'd also recommend the three Knutepunkt books: <a href="http://www.laivforum.dk/kp03_book/" rel="nofollow"><b>"As Larp Grows Up"</b></a> (2003), <a href="http://www.ropecon.fi/brap/" rel="nofollow"><b>"Beyond Role and Play"</b></a> (2004), and <a href="http://knutepunkt.laiv.org/" rel="nofollow"><b>"Dissecting Larp"</b></a> (2005).  <br/><br/>If you haven't played one of Shifting Forest Storyworks' <a href="http://www.shiftingforest.com/parlorlarps.html" rel="nofollow"><b>Parlor Larp</b></a> series, you should try one.  It's not very immersionist, but it's probably more immersionist than your tabletop gaming experiences.  <br/><br/>You can get some of Olle Jonsson's larp scenarios on his site, <a href="http://jeepen.org/games/" rel="nofollow"><b>jeepen.org</b></a>.  <br/><br/>(Obviously, all of this is for people who are interested in actually trying out more immersive designs and theory.

<i>Have you got any examples like that in mind, Elliot? [EDIT: I mean in roleplaying as currently known?]</i><br/><br/>Droog, I've never actually played in a LARP, but my impression is that this is very much how LARPs work. And thus the cultural split between Nordic theory and Forge-influenced theory is intertwined with the fact that the ratio of interest in LARP:tabletop is higher in Scandinavia than it is here. (At least that's how it looks to me.)<br/><br/>LARPS have access to a number of immersive techniques that tabletop lacks. Psychologically, they offer literally immersive environments. From a more logistical standpoint, they also support large numbers of independent actors and the use of physical space to limit a player's knowledge and capacity for action to match those of the character.<br/><br/>Still, in tabletop RP, I've been in groups which do things like having the GM pass notes to certain players to represent limited information (due to physical separation in the game world, or because just one person made his perception roll). I've also had GMs pass notes to players informing them that their character sees things a certain way (may be hallucinating--or is it the rest of the party?) or should act in a certain way. This last is obviously anti-immersive to the player on the receiving end, but can support immersion for the other players. Another technique is taking someone into another room to play out an encounter which only that PC is involved in. As a matter of taste, not all of these techniques are appreciated by all players, but they can be immersion-supporting.<br/><br/>I also think you were very much on the mark when you pointed to BRP as a good set of tools for immersionists. Only half of that is because of the smoothness and familiarity of the system. I'll grant that to some degree "transparency" is really just an excuse for hidebound mechanics. But the lack of metagame is important to immersionists for exactly the reasons I explained in relation to wargamers who want to experience a "You Are In Command" moment. The other part of it is relating the mechanic symbolically to the action. For example, unified resolution mechanics can be harmful to immersion if they make every action feel the same as every other action. I <i>suspect</i>  that this is a reason, aside from familiarity, that some BRPers resist <i>Heroquest</i>.<br/><br/>Does any of that help?                        </div>

                            Hi Elliot, this depends very much on the LARP. When I played in the MIT Assassin's Guild, the focus of play was very much on solving puzzles and outsmarting the other players. Solid in-character play (whether immersive or not) was gratefully appreciated but not essential.                        </div>

Errr, yeah. When I read droog's post, I actually read it as "Here's where I stand, not believing in the matter," and I <b>do</b> see an implied but not stated "...so convince me!", but that "Here's where I stand" bit is a huge 400-pound bouncer slamming down Red Bulls that you simply can't stare down or get around easily.

Andy, have you considered the Parlor Larps or Olle's scenarios like "The Upgrade"?  They're not hard-core immersionist, but they're very accessible and easy.  The more hard-core immersive games that I encountered were more taught than published, though you can read some cool material about many of the games in the Knutepunkt books.  <br/><br/>I wouldn't call myself hard-core immersive, but I'm probably as close as anyone here, so I'll take a stab at your dice question below.  (I'm more of a pansexual gamer.)  
<blockquote>"I swing my sword at them" [rolls] ('task") isn't any less immersion-breaking than "I vow on my here sword to rout these three bandits" [roll] ("conflict"). It's just that, after the dice hit the table, there's a little more interpretation and story to fill in with conflict resolution.<br/><br/>How that happens is the key to if it breaks "immersionism" or not.</blockquote>
OK, I can give you a personal comment from my point of view.  Personally, for me it makes a critical difference if the dice mechanic calls for an out-of-character choice -- or if it just involves processing a rolled number (or whatever).  It works much better for my immersive process if the choices I have to make map to character choices.  <br/><br/>The key issue with the keyword thing is -- will I be able to decide on saying "I vow on my sword here to rout these three bandits" without breaking my immersion?  The dice aren't as much of a problem as the decision process of what to say.  <br/><br/>The keywords sound interesting.  But which keywords are very important, and trying to link them into character thinking.  To note a potential problem...  I ran Polaris at AmberCon Northwest, and it went pretty well.  But we got a little stuck at one point, and that was where one of the players responded with "But only if the council agrees" -- when he felt that the council would *not* agree.  i.e. He was using the keywords as a phrase his character would say, but not according to the defined mechanics.  <br/><br/>There are forms of director-stance which are less immersion-breaking for me.  For example, Olle's scenario "The Upgrade" featured open scene framing -- pulling from improvisational acting games.  Anyone could jump in and declare a new scene at any time.  Similarly, giving a domain that you have authority over as Theatrix does (i.e. the ship's mechanic can answer questions about the ship) seems useful though I haven't used it so much.                        </div>

<p>Huh.</p>
<p>See, this is strange.</p>
<p>I'm not a huge fan of immersive play right now, but I had a lot of fun with it for four years or so, barring some traditional frustrations.  I feel like a lot of theoretical dialouge around that type of play is very mushy and not particularly useful for promoting enjoyable play, though, and I'd really like to improve it.</p>
<p>I <em>really</em> don't understand the persecution thing.  I mean, I'm also huge fan of Gamist play, which is basically way more persecuted in most role-playing circles (no, seriously, ask about mini-maxing sometime.)  I don't understand why, say, people saying "I don't believe that immersion exists" or even "I think immersion is covering for social dysfunction" is particularly offensive.</p>
<p>Let's take a hard look at what immersion is:</p>
<p>Immersion is an induced trance state in which the player of the game identifies with a fictional character, to a variety of degrees.  It is similar to meditation, guided visualization, or other intense mystical experiences.</p>
<p>The visualization is guided by a game master, who is by and large and amateur, as opposed to the common guides, therapists and relgious leaders, who are well trained.  The danger of psychological harm with intense immersive play is very real, and I think under-discussed in the critical writing about immersion, partially because of a fear that such criticism will rewaken BADD.</p>
<p>Immersion, like all mystical experiences, can be used as a denial of real-world problems, most especially social problems.  Socially problematic immersion (my key example being people in committed relationships hooking up with new people "in character") is the elephant in the room of immersionist play.  I say this not as an outsider, pointing and mocking, but as an insider, self critiquing.</p>
<p>Additionally, more at the artistic level, there is the huge problem of fragility.  This is odd -- most induced mystical states are actually quite robust.  I think that the core of this problem is that we don't have particularly good techniques for inducing or removing immersion, especially outside of the LARP context -- and as such it is very easily "broken."</p>
<p>So, I think, before we can talk about conflict resolution, we need to talk about</p>
<ul>
<li>Psychological safety</li>
<li>Social safety</li>
<li>Strengthening and deepening the trance</li>
</ul>
<p>I have some solutions for the third, but until I can nail down the first two, I honestly don't feel like talking about them.</p>
<p>yrs--<br/>

<p>P.S.  Big pet peeve: Immersion is not a creative agenda!  Comparing immersion and narrativism is like comparing, I don't know, chocolate cake and egg beaters.  One is a tool for cooking, and one is a food.</p>

                            I am, frankly, boggled by most of this discussion.<br/><br/>I cannot comprehend how <i>anyone</i> could not understand immersive play. Immersion is something so completely fundemental to my existence <i>as a human being</i> that I honestly struggle to understand how anyone can go through life and not believe in it. Immersion isn't just something that occurs in roleplaying games; it happens when I watch the news, it happens when I read a book, it happens when I write fiction, it happens when I act, it happens when I'm day-dreaming.<br/><br/>When your friends tell you stories of their day, or of when good or bad things happened to them don't you try and get inside their head and experience what they must have felt? When you hear stories of tragedy or survival don't you want to know how they must have felt? What must have gone on in their heads? Don't you try to put yourself there?<br/><br/>Immersion is the same thing in a different context.<br/><br/>Tony and Adam - you are both right. Immersion is both a tool and a goal. When I'm playing, immersion is a big part of the <i>point</i> of roleplaying for me, a huge fat chunk of the reward I get out of playing. But it's also a tool (especially when I'm GMing), a means of creating coherant and consistent characters and getting behaviour and actions that go against what I, as a player, would choose but are still interesting and exciting.<br/><br/>Immersion is, of course, not the be all and the end all of roleplaying. And, <a href="http://www.greatorkgods.co.uk" rel="nofollow">obviously</a>, I enjoy games without immersion as well but I distinctly prefer them with.<br/><br/>As for immersion and conflict resolution, I see not problem at all. In fact, I consider conflict resolution to be frequently more suited than task resolution. The essential difference between conflict and task resolution (as I see it) is that conflict resolution is about <i>desires</i> while task resolution is about <i>actions</i>. Well, when I'm immersing, the character desires are first and foremost in my mind so they as easy, if not easier, for me to express as actions are.                        </div>

                            This thread has been very enlightening.  I've been working with the scene-framing and conflict resolution system in Dramatikos to allow for more immersive play that isn't simply FFRPG with more stringent rules.  The main problem I have seen is that I thought that immersive players wanted to have the rules and numbers completely removed from the game because it breaks the illusion.  Thankfully, I have been corrected on that account.  Would it be more accurate to say that immersive players enjoy systems where the rules don't force you to continually think outside of your character?  If this still doesn't get it, I'd love to hear a more precise explanation.<br/>
<br/>
Where Dramatikos is now, I have things set up so that the elements of your character can be easily revealed and used via dialogue and/or action.  In the cases where it isn't, it's easy to do that alongside speaking and acting in character.  Is this something of what immersive players are looking for?                        </div>

                            Immersion <i>is</i> role-playing, literally playing the role of a fictional character to the best of your ability. I'm a big fan of immersion, I enjoy it in isolation from exploration, gaming or narrative.<br/><br/>To return to Judd's original point I think it is a very immersion friendly mechanic, you switch from being immersed in one character to another, to me this doesn't break immersion at all. However, immersion is a continuum of fun (like gaming, exploration or narrative) and people will find themselves at different points along the continuum. <br/><br/>I think Tony's proposed ideas with the gods should satisfy most players who enjoy immersion. <br/>But, the most ardent immersionist will not be satisfied with any RP system and should really go and do improv instead. <br/><br/>I'd recommend taking a look at the Baron Munchhausen rpg, this is the most immersive PnP rpg I've ever played - all mechanics are played out in-character, indeed the entire rulebook is also written in-character! You sit down, talk, drink and game in-character.<br/><br/>More on immersion here: <a href="http://www.princeofdarknessgames.com/theory/GENIUS.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.princeofdarknessgames.com/theory/GENIUS.htm</a><br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Joe                        </div>

I disagree that immersion is <i>equivalent to</i> role-playing, yet I agree with your definition of role-playing. You can play the role of a fictional character without immersing. <br/><br/>When I talk about immersion, I'm talking about a certain kind of role-playing, a mode in which decisions about your character's actions are made at a gut level because you're reprogramming your brain to be someone else, at least for a little while. <br/><br/>I wrote about this theory in my LiveJournal post, <a href="http://adamdray.livejournal.com/155580.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">My theory of immersion in role-playing</a>. Essentially, human beings do a certain amount of "personality switching" every day. We train our brains with repetitive behavior and it makes it easier to act that way by rote the next time we're in that situation. Once trained, we don't stop to think about <i>why</i> we do it that way.<br/><br/>Edit 2:11 PM ET: Added <i>equivalent to</i> for clarity of meaning.                        </div>

<p>I think the thread I want to see is JUST of people who play for/with immersion, riffing on what it is that can faciliate (or harm!) good play. It's not that people who don't play as much immersion (like me) can't understand it (I do) or won't give suggestions (I shall!) but I think some non-interjected listening would be cool, and then we can jump in on what we think. (I guess there's a high non-immerssive-player : immersive-player ratio on this particular thread.)</p>

<br/>
The rules of FFRP are not the sort that you see written down in books, though.<br/>
<br/>
The rules are things like "No God-Mode" (which means you can't dictate in your narration, how another character reacts to what you do) and "I Will Not Abandon You."                        </div>

                            What Dev said.  We're not going to get anywhere on designing for immersion if people keep de-railing discussions by saying "prove to me immersion exists/is useful/fun!" or "I don't like/believe in that shit!" or "does this mechanic work for immersionists?" (as if they all feel the same about it).  If you're openly hostile to immersion or don't really dig it or aren't interested in designing for it or don't believe designing for it is possible or a good idea, maybe you should reconsider posting to a thread which is <i>about designing for immersion</i>.

I can see where you're coming from with that.  Do you think that the reason FFRP is the best venue for games with immersion as their primary goal is that they do not impose a structure upon interaction, and therefore allow the players to say and do what their characters would?                        </div>

I'll add another question (though I'm interested in your take on Green's).  Do you think that the reason rules conflict with doing and saying exactly what your character would is because the character doesn't know the rules?  With an obvious eye to the follow-up of "Would this problem evaporate in a game where the character was aware of the rules?"                        </div>

<br/>
I think a key point to immersion is that it tends to happen best when the rules are known so well that they can be ignored while being followed -- and are expressed in a way that doesn't interfere with immersive roleplaying.  This can be "rules-of-reality" (in live-everything LARP play), or existing rules of conversation with a few other conventions (in freeform play), or even a long-known and long understood simulationist system (like very experienced immersive D&amp;D players).<br/>
<br/>
Now, there are some systems that even if internalized, will tend to interfere with immersion.  PTA conflict negotiation, for example, is more or less impossible to handle while remaining in character.  Other Nar games are more problematic because they are trying to change the way people play -- to get them to deviate from existing rules of conversation, and may be immersion-suitable with sufficient experience.                        </div>

                            Hi <b>Green</b>,<br/><br/>I think I agree, let me put it in my own words and see what you think. I think there are two reasons FFRP works so well for immersion because there is no disconnect between conception and game world reality in character concept. In a normal RPG there are a bunch of numbers (words, pictures, whatever) on the character sheet that define my character. In principle these numbers are (usually) supposed to represent the character I originally conceived and am now playing. Trouble is, they inevitably don't, there is a disconnect between the character I have in my head, the character I'm currently immersed in, and the character that is represented by the rules. When the rules happen and the outcome is different to my conception of how my character should have happened that jars the immersion.<br/><br/>The second is the obvious point that has been made already, that rules will often force me to think outside of the character in order to be effective.<br/><br/>I conclude, thus far, that <i>In order to be good for immersion systems need to: have as small as possible a disconnect between conceived character and mechanical character and not require me to think out of character to be effective.</i><br/><br/>Which leads me on to answering <b>Tony</b>'s question: I don't know but I don't think so. I suppose it could in principle, however a game in which characters can know the rules is likely to be deeply alien - it is much easier to immerse in a game in which the characters are human or near-human (for fairly obvious reasons). In any case, knowing the rules in-character is only going to help with the second of the two problems for immersion and not the rules-conception disconnect.                        </div>

                            I think that "crunchy" roleplaying games should probably not bother worrying about immersion.  The immersionists are probably better off with LARP and FFRP.<br/>
<br/>
Same reason that RPGs shouldn't bother with complex mechanics and stat synergies; leave that to the xbox crowd.                        </div>

<p><code>I suppose it could in principle, however a game in which characters can know the rules is likely to be deeply alien</code></p>
<p>Okay ... I don't get this.</p>
<p>Or, rather, I can think of intensely alien games where the characters know the rules.  I can also think of intensely human games where the characters know the rules.</p>
<p>As a for-instance, I posted <em>way up above</em> the idea for a game where characters are arrogant heroes who routinely test themselves against Gods, in order to gain the boons those Gods can bestow.  So one of the rules in that world is "If you demand something from a God that God will test you (in his own distincitive way) and if you pass that test then what you demanded will come to pass."  That rule is used by the characters in exactly the same way it is used by the players:  the player and the character both want the same thing to happen in the character's life.  The player and the character both choose to challenge a God as a way of making that happen.  They both know that this is manipulating the rules of the character's universe.</p>
<p>Does that strike you as terribly alien?  It strikes me as ... I dunno ... human in a very primal sense.</p>

                            On that level, sure the characters can know the rules. But how are you going to set up the actual test in a way that means the characters still know the rules? How's the conflict resolution going to happen in a character knowable way?<br/><br/>I'm not saying it can't happen; I'm just not seeing the details of how it can happen. Maybe I'm just too caught up in thinking of the character saying "I am a third level Fighter and I have a sword skill of seven!" to see what you are getting at.                        </div>

While Hearts and Souls (my super hero game)  focuses on tasks (for a very specific reason) the nature of its resolution is to tie it motivation. It is a superhero game, success or failure is up to the  /character/ (albeit intentionally connecting that back to the player as well)  via the motivation, not the player. Now I don't know how well that support other peoples immersion--but it works for mine just fine.<br/>
<br/>
A character knows what he/she has been given by the frame--the narrative description setup for the task (or conflict situation)--the character chooses to try hard or give up.<br/>
