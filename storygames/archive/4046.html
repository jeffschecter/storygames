Isn't that cool?<br/>\n<br/>\nHit points are still a pacing mechanism:  A way that you stay away from the extremes of "I'm toast!" in one way or another.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut for <i>Misery Bubblegum</i>, I sort of want people to be vaccilating between confronting (though not necessarily embracing) those extremes.  What to do, what to do?<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's my untested idea:  I play with cards, that you draw from.  Suppose that drawing cards is sacrificing one track of "Hit points" in exchange for effectiveness.  You're running that pile down.  When it hits empty, you are vulnerable to whatever fate those cards/resources were keeping you protected from.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith me so far?  Because now I'm going to talk about your DISCARD PILE.  Because that, I think, would be the <i>second</i> set of resources keeping you away from some grim fate.  And that keeps increasing, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou've got two resources ... say "Passion" and "Safety."  When it starts off, Safety is your draw pile (you start the game safe) and Passion is your discard pile (you start the game fairly inactive).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you draw cards, your safety is reduced ... the barriers that keep other people from touching and changing you are being lowered ... either because you choose to lower them in order to get something done, or because somebody in some way lowers them from the outside.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you play cards (and discard them) your passion is rising.  You can't call on it yet, because it's the one going up (not the one going down) but it's getting stockpiled.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you are close enough that the next conflict can run you out of Safety cards, you're vunlnerable in some way.  You want to <i>win</i> your next conflict, so that you can pass by this moment without having to be massively changed ... or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the moment has passed (whether with scarring consequences or not) things <b>flip</b>, literally.  You flip over your Passion pile.  Now you draw from PASSION and discard into SAFETY.  Your actions are different now.  You push outward, trying to change the world, and spending your energy to do so.  As you do that, you affirm your sense of self, and make it harder for people to sway you with just a word.  You spend Passion, and gain Safety.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd when you run out of Passion, you are once again vulnerable ... this time to apathy, to surrender, to not being able to go on.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then things flip.<br/>\n<br/>\nThroughout all of this, some mechanism is also <i>permanently removing cards from the game</i>.  So as the game goes on, these flip flops happen more and more frequently.  You're vulnerable in some way more and more of the time.  You're changing and being changed at an ever escalating rate, until finally people just flat-out run out of cards, and the session is over.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that sound like it would work?  It sounds pretty good to me ... I just don't know what all the pieces should be.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat would winning a conflict get you?  Would it let you shift a certain number of cards from someone's draw pile to their discard pile?  That could be used both defensively ("Whoa!  I move three cards.  I discard my last Safety card, flip my Passion pile and discard my first two Passion cards.  Now I've got a solid margin of safety, and I've passed that crisis") or offensively ("Aha!  I discard your last Safety card, and now you are completely vulnerable!  I get to really put the hurt on!") or supportively ("Heh.  Yeah.  I'll shepherd you past this crisis.  I coulda hurt you, but that's nothing I would ever want.")<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat should pull cards out of the system permanently?  <i>Also</i> winning?  At GenCon, winning a conflict meant you lost the cards you won the conflict with ... and that seemed to balance pretty well.<br/>\n<br/>\nHrm.  I wonder whether this draw-discard balance would work, and if so what the supporting rules need to be to give it the right structure.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tyler" title="Tyler"><img alt="Tyler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tyler">Tyler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90516/#Comment_90516" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-26T14:54:28+00:00" title="August 26, 2007  2:54PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">When you are close enough that the next conflict can run you out of Safety cards, you're vunlnerable in some way.

Specific inspirations are certain seasons of Smallville where Clark sacrifices a bit of his passion/desire to have Lana as his own to protect his secret/because he is afraid she will reject him for his secret.  Another inspiration is the short story the Secret Life of Walter Mitty where the named character escapes into various dream worlds to avoid the unpleasantness of his real life.  <br>Especially with the inclusion of a way that cards get 'permanently' discarded, the deck flipping mechanic you describe seems to fit my vision in a certain way.  You work toward your Passion until you are in danger of causing Strife in your life, then you work toward personal Peace until Progress toward your goals is threatened once again.<br>Perhaps you could voluntarially flip your decks at wil - and at the cost of one or more cards....                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90614/#Comment_90614" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-27T05:26:45+00:00" title="August 27, 2007  5:26AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Blue</cite>Perhaps you could voluntarially flip your decks at wil - and at the cost of one or more cards....</blockquote>That seems to make the resource-management of the two decks pretty easy.  The "cost of cards" is actually preordained (when you get down to the end of one deck it costs you a card, but you couldn't choose <i>not</i> to get down there, only how fast).  How would that be tactically different from having one big deck?<br><br>If it requires a win to flip your decks, I'm a bit worried by a possible death-spiral at the extremes:  You run out of (say) Passion cards, <b>AND</b> you spend all the cards in your hand on losing conflicts trying to flip back to your Safety deck ... and then you're stuck, safe but apathetic, until either the game ends or someone chooses to rescue you.<br><br>I'm ... not really sure whether that's a bug or a feature, though.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
