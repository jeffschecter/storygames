It won a Ronnie award. Ron Edwards sent me a check $50.00. It was the first time anyone gave me any dollars for designing a game. It was pretty special. <br/><br/>Anathema's rules are quite light but Anathema's premise is really heavy. Here's what the game's about ("trigger warning" for industrial scale mass murder, global depopulation, merciless angels of death):\n<blockquote>In this roleplaying game for two to six players, you play a Shroud. Once human, you are now an angel of death tasked with the culling of millions of human lives. To do so, you will use the powers of war, pestilence, famine, misfortune, atrophy, and despair at your fingertips to kill men, women, and children indiscriminately. This horrible act is nothing less than necessary, to decrease the surplus population of Earth in order to save the entire human race from extinction.<br/><br/>How can you kill millions of people to serve The Balance while clinging to the tatters of your humanity?</blockquote>\nSo yeah, Anathema's not a brand new game by any means. For several years since then I've been marketing Anathema to mainly probably the wrong people, people who weren't very interested in this kind of game. I am just posting this thread to take a shot at marketing Anathema to the right sort of people.
