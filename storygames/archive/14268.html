We talked about trying to define an RPG, and most people agreed that was a bad idea, and you should stick to explaining how *your* game worked. And we talked about "going beyond minimum instruction" with...wideranging but sometimes interesting results.<br/><br/>My question is how to write an RPG text for an readership that may simultaneously include successful RPG designers and someone who has never even seen an RPG before in their lives.<br/><br/>Most of the instructional texts out there in the world pitch themselves at complete beginners and leave the experts to take care of themselves. But is that really the way to go for a small press RPG that will probably be read 99% of the time by people who have played similar games for years? I am sceptical. Maybe because in my professional life I write technical stuff, mostly for fairly informed audiences. I *prefer* to write for the average person, but I'm very aware that the informed audience doesn't want to read that stuff, on the whole.<br/><br/>Your thoughts would be appreciated.

When your write a game text, you're in part trying to anticipate that conversation. That means identifying what people will expect from your text - what people think a roleplaying game should be.<br/><br/>My sense is that people's expectations about game texts have a parabolic arc as they gain experience. People start out with few expectations. They don't know anything about roleplaying, so they won't read much into the text that's not there. As people gain experience, they often form a sense of what roleplaying "is", and at this point are likely to come to a text with a lot of expectations. People who have played a lot of different games though, tend to be more aware of the range of possible ways of playing a game, and have fewer expectations.<br/><br/>In other words, if you can successfully anticipate what the expectations of the reader will be, what "normal" play looks like to them, and those expectations match the game you are designing, then yes, you can pitch your text to an "expert" reader. I suspect that's an unusual situation though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323819/#Comment_323819" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-10T15:55:27+00:00" title="May 10, 2011  3:55PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Organize your text so that each chapter:<br/><br/>- is composed of subsections that are clearly labeled<br/>- the first sentence says what it is about and who it is for<br/>- include a bullet point summary at the beginning<br/>- restrict each subsection to 2 page spreads<br/><br/>This way experienced users can easily skip past anything they don't want to read. <br/><br/>Additionally, have a section that says, "if you're experienced with RPGs, feel free to skip X, Y, and Z but note the following ideas that may run counter to your experience or expectations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323823/#Comment_323823" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-10T16:09:29+00:00" title="May 10, 2011  4:09PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>Organize your text so that each chapter:<br/><br/>- is composed of subsections that are clearly labeled<br/>- the first sentence says what it is about and who it is for<br/>- include a bullet point summary at the beginning<br/>- restrict each subsection to 2 page spreads<br/><br/>This way experienced users can easily skip past anything they don't want to read.<br/><br/>Additionally, have a section that says, "if you're experienced with RPGs, feel free to skip X, Y, and Z but note the following ideas that may run counter to your experience or expectations.</blockquote>\nInteresting proposal!

Because when you propose something as 'better, more efficient, more fun etc..." you are effectively saying "righter" and the implication is that anyone not using your proposed idea is "wronger".  So you make 5 bullet points about why your game is funner, better etc..., and their very first reaction will be to look for THE MISTAKE - the thing they don't agree with because <i>they </i>don't have a problem with that thing.  So if <i>you </i>have a problem with that thing, then you are <b>wrong </b>and therefore your whole proposal is <b>WRONG</b>.

Just write what they need to know and get going.<br/><br/>If you're writing a game for non-roleplayers or a game that asks players to do some things that they might not know how to do (like, say, Apocalypse World or Polaris), then that's a critical part of writing the game.  Make it both informative and fun to read!  How else will players know what to do!  If you can't bring yourself to do this, then maybe you should think more about writing a game more like Lady Blackbird, for a different audience, asking them to do what they know.<br/><br/>I'm increasingly of the mind that there aren't many games in between these.  I mean, I guess there could be games aimed at new audiences where you're just telling them how to do stuff that most roleplayers already know how to do, but then, yeah, that seems really mind-numbingly dull to me.

Walton</cite>Why write stuff if you're expecting people to skip it? </blockquote>\nMy enjoyment of roleplaying games was delayed for years simply because the AD&amp;D books didn't fully explain how to read 4-siders. They went into bell curves and such, but assumed that everyone knew how to use those crazy dice. Yes, it would have been a section that all experienced roleplayers would have skipped, but I needed it because I didn't want to ask an experienced roleplayer for that basic piece of information and look like an idiot.So, those 1st Ed books that I got when I was 19 years old went up on the book shelf and are in almost pristine condition.<br/><br/>My point is that if you are writing a roleplaying game that may include those new to roleplaying, you need to have the basics. The nice thing about an rpg is that the instructions are modular in nature. Its possible to put sections in there that the experienced can jump over, but an idiot that is just starting out can find out that you look at the number on the top point or bottom side of a 4-sider to get the number from it. The basic information doesn't need to be very long or involved, and ideally, it should be something that rules later in the book build on.<br/><br/>Also, you need to keep the nature of your game in mind. If it is an oddball that doesnt' follow a lot of convetentional rules, those basics are going to become very important to everyone, beginners and experienced players alike. A good example would be Dirty Secrets by Seth Ben-Ezra. Its "one player and many GMs" approach turns the whole roleplaying convention inside-out. Every section of the rules is important in order to learn the game. My own Silver Screen Dreams also shakes up a number of conventions. With this next iteration of the game, I am being extremely careful so that each rule builds on the ones before it. I don't want to ge the only one that can play the game and have fun with it.<br/><br/>So, take your chosen audience into account. If you want to just write some little thing for experienced players, leave out as much info as you like. You may even be lauded for it. However, if you want to write a professional-grade product that you can sell outside of an online lemonade stand, take the beginners into acount and write for them, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323868">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323868/#Comment_323868" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-11T00:17:18+00:00" title="May 11, 2011 12:17AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 11, 2011 12:24AM by John_Harper.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (snarky, bullshit comment deleted)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323869/#Comment_323869" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-11T00:42:12+00:00" title="May 11, 2011 12:42AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 11, 2011 12:42AM by JDCorley.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Always pretend like I don't know anything and I just wandered in drunk, because:<br/><br/>1) I normally don't know anything and I'm often drunk while reading your game, I often get distracted by downloading pornography or suddenly deciding that now would be a great time to reread a Nero Wolfe novel.<br/><br/>2) It helps me see where you're coming from and what the game's about.<br/><br/>Like, take the introductory text of D&amp;D3, D&amp;D4, and the DMG's most basic, stupid, "here's what a DM does!" stuff.

You can write exciting game text, period, whatever your intended audience is.  It's certainly easier to write games for an audience that has more or less the same kinds of gaming experiences as yourself, because you don't have to write as much or be as careful.<br/><br/>How do you pick your target audience? Man, I'm not sure how to answer that.  It really depends on what your intentions are for your game, what kind of hobby or business you want to be involved with, whether you think your game has broad appeal, who you enjoy playing your game with, etc.  My suggestion, especially for first-time designers or first-time publishers, and I said this to a bunch of health care execs at a conference last week, is to start out desiging for a limited audience that you know very well.  After all, if you don't know your audience, how do you know what they like, want, and need?  How can you write a game for them?  How can you build up a following? How can you market and sell it (if that's what you want to do)?  You have to build on your existing connections with people to do any of that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324187/#Comment_324187" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-12T16:34:44+00:00" title="May 12, 2011  4:34PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John, what if your game doesnt have an implied situation or setting.

But it does need to have something to say.  PTA says things about what makes good television (in Matt's opinion). Microsope says things about approaching a narrative from lots of different angles and scopes. Geiger Counter expresses how I feel about survival horror as a genre.  To be able to do this, you need to know what your game is actually about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324392/#Comment_324392" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-13T20:32:12+00:00" title="May 13, 2011  8:32PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 13, 2011 8:34PM by stefoid.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            RATE MY PITCH!!!

Your Ingenero sessions will rock!</i>]<br/><br/><b>Ingenero is the vehicle, and the players are the driver.<br/>The GM is the open, unwinding road.<br/>Character decisions are the steering.<br/>Character goals are the accelerator and brakes.<br/>Reward points are the fuel.</b><br/><br/>Ingenero is a little system with a big engine.  Its primary purpose is to align the players and GM in the same direction, and propel the characters towards dramatic action.<br/><br/>The GM prepares, but doesn\u2019t plot \u2013 Ingenero calls for improvised GMing.  But the system helps out by ensuring the players drive the story forward with their character motivations and goals they set.  GMs experienced at improvised play will find Ingenero a snap to run, while those less familiar will appreciate how the system guides them.<br/><br/>The game is played in two alternating phases, with the first focussed entirely on story development, character decisions and their consequences.  When the characters advance closely on their goals, play switches to challenge phase and zooms in on those decisive moments of achievement or failure.<br/><br/><br/><b>CINEMATIC STYLE, DRAMATIC ACTION:</b><br/>A principle of the system is the focus on the rules of drama rather than the rules of physics or probability.  The game takes its cue for \u2018rules of drama\u2019 from books and cinema.   Rather than ask \u2018How would that really happen?\u2019, the question is \u2018How would that happen in a book or film?\u201d  Drama and practical, satisfying gaming trumps realism.<br/><br/>Characters are defined by descriptive outcomes they can generate, called plays, rather than skills and equipment.  Conflict resolution uses plays to provide well-paced, tactical play full of immersive imagery.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324397/#Comment_324397" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-13T21:28:53+00:00" title="May 13, 2011  9:28PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I kinda am down on metaphors for gaming in general?

They are skeptical about any claims you make.  They've heard it all before and have been burnt by it, but are still interested in giving it a shot.  Consequently, claims like "this game is fun!" or "it's a snap!" are pretty much meaningless.  Instead, tell us what the players do, or what the characters do, or what happens in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324462/#Comment_324462" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-14T13:04:39+00:00" title="May 14, 2011  1:04PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think rpg writers could learn something from board game rulebooks. <br/><br/>An rpg book is trying to do everything.<br/><br/>It's trying to sell you the game<br/>It's trying to teach you the game<br/>It's trying to inspire you to play the game<br/><br/>All a board game rule book has to do teach you. the box sold you the game, the components and production value inspire you to play it.

Walton</cite>I agree with JD. The only thing I learned about your game is this:<br/>The game is played in two alternating phases, with the first focussed entirely on story development, character decisions and their consequences. When the characters advance closely on their goals, play switches to challenge phase and zooms in on those decisive moments of achievement or failure.</blockquote>\nOther than that, it's all just marketing copy, not really anything descriptive.<br/><br/>Here's the thing: when writing a description of your game, assume that the reader has been attracted purely by the title or cover image (which is typically what happens) to pick up your book and flip it over.  They are skeptical about any claims you make.  They've heard it all before and have been burnt by it, but are still interested in giving it a shot.  Consequently, claims like "this game is fun!" or "it's a snap!" are pretty much meaningless.  Instead, tell us what the players do, or what the characters do, or what happens in play.<br/><br/>These days purchasers are probably buying from the the authors website.  Few Indie games and even probably even few store sales would be generated from the cover of an actual  text.  You have probably seen one or two web reviews or internet forum word of mouth before committing to a purchase.  I recon all you want from a cover is something memorable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324496/#Comment_324496" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-14T17:55:42+00:00" title="May 14, 2011  5:55PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's arguably true for some kinds of sales, but not others.  Convention sales can be a significant number, especially at launch. And retailer sales, even for indie games, are nothing to laugh at. Furthermore, a lot of retailers are going to choose whether or not to stock your book based on the back cover blurb (which is what shows up when they're browsing IPR).  Even if you're just selling your game through your website or giving it away for free as a PDF, you have to folks a reason to buy or download it, and I don't really see why your website text should be that different (or at all different) from your back cover text.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324541/#Comment_324541" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-15T00:42:39+00:00" title="May 15, 2011 12:42AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            By contrast, I can tell you nothing of marketing, as my mind is a clean slate, blank in all directions, pure and unsullied by such crass material concerns, or maybe just pig ignorant, it's your call.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324556">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324556/#Comment_324556" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-15T06:23:09+00:00" title="May 15, 2011  6:23AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Things I took away: "action-oriented" - this I could get from D&amp;D. "Cinematic" - OK, a bit clearer. "Two phases" - OK this bit sounds different. Not sure why it's good, but at least it's different. "Empowers players" - too vague and abstract, why do I care? I could play a GM-less game if this was really a big deal. Extended driving metaphor - sounds like most games, except it has Reward Points. That means something to me, at least. The bit about following story logic makes sense in the context of cinematic and sounds sensible.<br/><br/>So the overall message I get is that if I've always wanted to play a cinematic, all-action game with a GM but found that the prep was too much work, play tended to get bogged down in irrelevancies, and inappropriate use of physics was limiting play, this system will solve those problems, so long as the players will accept meta-gamey stuff like reward points in return for being "empowered", and can be clear about what it is that they want.<br/><br/>That's not all that appealing to me, but then again I'm probably not the target audience for this game, so that may not be a disaster. I'm finding it hard to image how anyone is going to be moved beyond "mildly interested" though. <br/><br/>The logical part of me always wants to identify problems that a game solves. The trouble is that most people won't think they have any problems, because after all they enjoy the games they play. So in practice this line of argument is likely to create resistance rather than agreement. <br/><br/>I think one of the things people actually want from a game system is that it produces interesting results without throwing up problems that threaten suspension of disbelief. Does that help you at all? How does Ingenero make play more interesting that some of the other games that aim at cinematic results?<br/><br/>And as usual, some self-reflection on what I've typed has been valuable.

So lets call that the 'experience'.  It doesn't make any attempt to back up what it says about the experience in the actual 'why to play'  blurb with references to mechanics or procedures.  If Vincent Baker says 'play because the characters are hot!'  thats great, but if I say "Play because... your games will rock!'  that's a meaningless claim.   <br/><br/>A semi-generic game still has an experience.  But in terms of saying what the experience is AND backing it up in one page.

This is achieved using two alternating phases -- the first focused entirely on story development, character decisions and consequences, and the second zooms in on those decisive moments of achievement or failure when the characters advance closely on their goals.<br/><br/>An important principle is adhering to the <i>rules of drama</i> rather than the rules of physics or probability. Characters always get a chance to at least compete for their goals -- they are never completely knocked out of a conflict prematurely.<br/><br/>A key aim of the system is <i>cinematic conflict resolution</i>. Conflicts are resolved using descriptive, competing actions which can be used to target other characters, maneuver for advantage, and even aid or interfere with another characters actions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324861">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324861/#Comment_324861" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-17T00:27:17+00:00" title="May 17, 2011 12:27AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 17, 2011 12:27AM by Dave Hallett.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that's a lot better in terms of content - it gives me a much better idea of why I might be interested and what's distinctive about the game.

Write to that audience. Preface the book with a short paragraph called "WTF is going on here?" (or whatever concise, idiomatic heading matches the flavour of your game). While you write the book, note every term, every procedure, every concept that you're not explaining because of your audience decision. When you're done, write the Noob's Appendix and go back to write the "WTF" paragraph to point to the Noob's Appendix. This should also help you to avoid overloading terms, to be clear about terminology, and leave you with a glossary / reference chapter. I would wager it exposes some mechanical corner-cases, too.<br/><br/>While I wholeheartedly agree that it's possible to make a text interesting or exciting, there is no getting around the fact that if your game text does not describe how to play the game, you have failed.<br/><br/>As someone upthread suggested, get reader feedback, at minimum from three people: a writer of instructional texts, a player of games, a non-player of games who you think would like the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325362/#Comment_325362" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-19T12:23:13+00:00" title="May 19, 2011 12:23PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Alexander, that reads like good advice to me.<br/><br/>I'm still intrigued by some of the ideas raised on this thread, particularly Dave Berg's diagrams (I imagine these as making the game text look like IKEA assembly instructions, except I have no idea how that would work!), but there's been some sage advice and interesting counterpoints.
