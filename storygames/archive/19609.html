It has to do with Story Now. That is, get to the meaningful bits of a story right now through hard choices. That provides interesting play in the moment, but doesn't guarantee that the pieces come together in anything resembling a meaningful plot.<br/><br/>However, because it tends to produce structure a lot like modern stories, especially compared to other types of rambling and wandering games, it often does produce a coherent plot. Also, I suspect that the technical agendas that players and designers often tie to Story Now games help to keep players in Director Mode, and that helps produce a coherent plot.<br/><br/>Coherent plot is hard. If that's your main goal, you have to attack it straight on and think about it during play, or have a play structure that guides you there. <br/><br/>Look at the scene structure in Misspent Youth. It models story structure with introductions, rising action, a point of no return, a darkest hour, and so on. Merely following that structure pretty much guarantees a coherent plot, but it doesn't guarantee specific character arcs that you might want (sometimes the dice are too nice or too mean). It takes conscious effort to follow the scene structure and not just fall into old gaming habits. <br/><br/>Primetime Adventures tackles plot straight on with an explicit GM-as-Director/Producer role. It's one person's responsibility to get coherent plot and character arcs, but they have to spend energy to make it happen. <br/><br/>Dogs in the Vineyard has a Town-creation bootstrapping procedure that produces a coherent plot of sorts. The King of Life's Watchdogs arrive in town, people come to them for help, complications arise, the Dogs solve the problems (probably with guns) and we learn more about who these Dogs are as a result. And probably who the players at the table are, too. The effort to make the coherent plot comes mainly from planning the Town, which takes maybe an hour before the game, and there are procedures in-game for making Towns, but it's as much art as science.<br/><br/>Those are three examples off the top of my head of how some games can facilitate Story Now group play and help produce a coherent plot via game mechanics. Note that the game mechanics are an additional thing beyond "address human issues."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435701/#Comment_435701" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-23T12:46:25+00:00" title="July 23, 2014 12:46PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Exactly as Adam says.<br/><br/>There's absolutely nothing about a Narrativist Agenda which requires a coherent plot.<br/><br/>However, it's pretty hard to tell a story which addresses human issues and does *not*, at some level, feel like a satisfying story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer" title="Dreamer"><img alt="Dreamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer">Dreamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435702/#Comment_435702" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-23T12:51:32+00:00" title="July 23, 2014 12:51PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 23, 2014 12:52PM by Dreamer.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Adam!

Yet: the two can be intertwined.  If you set up a satisfactorily-loosely-connectable set of goals and objects, the nature of the human brain being what it is, plot tends to emerge.  A well-made Fiasco playset is a good example.  This is exactly the same thing that gives rise to conspiracy theories - the human brain connecting dots and finding patterns.  We are really really good at that.  When it comes to drama and literature, we actually have names for all these patterns (even though most people don't know them, it's not necessary to know them by name - you know them when you see them).<br/><br/>Myth patterns already exist in the cultural consciousness for all the various sorts of dynamic situations, and we're good at spotting them.  Therefore it's not surprising to see players draw upon shared ontologies (certain regular patterns of genre, tropes, fiction establishment, dynamism and outcome that we have learned from myths, stories, fairytales, books, movies, "the 36 dramatic situations" etc, our whole lives).  And in fact there's a kinda pre-known "official ending" for all of these situations, generally having to do with "justice" in Aristotelian drama, but in these postmodern times more ironic endings are often entertained.  Over time it became more desirable/imperative to include at least one "twist", often near the end, to satisfy more sophisticated audiences.  This expanded the possible number of end-states for each situation, and yet that number is still finite.<br/><br/>I propose that these subconscious "pre-known end states" serve as "strange attractors" toward which the players will tend to drive if given the opportunity to do so.  I'm not talking about "plot" per se, but rather a drive to emulate a structure from which, if followed without too much randomness injected, will tend to produce something that <i>gives rise to</i> plot <span style="text-decoration: underline;">automatically</span> in the human mind.  <br/><br/>The problem is in governing the types of elements introduced for possible inclusion in patterns by players, and the conceptual distance between them in application.  If they're too far apart or disparate, the end result is surrealism or silliness.  This is what I call a "parody engine" - it succeeds mainly in producing parodies of its own artistic intention.  <br/><br/>The design questions at this point become both technical and preferential, along the lines of: "How narrowly can I constrain choice, say by controlling genre perhaps, such that a preponderance of meaningful connections can be drawn?" or "How much variety can I inject into a stochastic system without causing the meaningful connections to be so loose that they only make sense ironically?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435717/#Comment_435717" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-23T17:51:17+00:00" title="July 23, 2014  5:51PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wrote something about this a while ago that  might be helpful:<br/><br/><a href="http://githyankidiaspora.wordpress.com/2009/10/15/the-myth-of-story-preservation/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://githyankidiaspora.wordpress.com/2009/10/15/the-myth-of-story-preservation/</a><br/><br/>In Story Now play you are not at all thinking about making a good story. You are not making decisions for the good of the story. Eff that in the aye.<br/><br/>The goal of games, even narr-heavy thematic games Story Now, is not to make a story. Story happens.<br/><br/>The goal is a night of people making meaningful choices at the table. Story is a by-product, like exhaust coming out of a car.<br/><br/>It is also a by-product of gamist play and sim play. Story just happens.<br/><br/>Looking out for the story leads to constipation at the table. Story does not need to be preserved or looked out for. It is not a just hatched chick that needs everyone to be careful lest it is trampled. Just play the damned game, make choices that are brave. Look at your character sheet, let your character surprise you and story will just happen.<br/><br/>Do not preserve story. Shitty stories are made in those times everyone is being careful not to ruin the story, leading to cowardly decisions and furrowed brows and serious thinking about serious things. Story is fun, let it out of the cage. Let the story get damaged and messy.<br/><br/>I like my stories with only one headlight, the other smashed and a dinged up fender. I like my story with an engine that shouldn\u2019t work, that mechanics insist should not run anymore because there is no spark plug and no engine oil. I like them messy and loud with chipped paint and a spider-web crack in the windshield.

Actually, plot tends to be discovered after the game and people start putting scenes in order post-play.<br/>I have, however, run several one-shot scenarios that had very tight plots from the get-go.<br/>"The Journey" gives each player every scene on an index card. The card describes in who is in the scene, in what order they're allowed to speak, and what they're supposed to talk about. Mind you, the card doesn't say what the other characters are allowed to say. Very, VERY intense.<br/>Other scenarios have completely scripted scenes where the gm acts more like a director, even to the point of asking players to re-take scenes and instructing them in how to play (come on, that was tame. I need to see more emotion!!!). While this would be death to a gamist, for my players it often means having to spend a couple of hours post-play drinking tea and crying while being hugged by the GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435755">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer" title="Dreamer"><img alt="Dreamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer">Dreamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435755/#Comment_435755" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-24T18:08:09+00:00" title="July 24, 2014  6:08PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interestingly, it seems there are two opposite opinions expressed here: plot doesn't just happen in narrativism (but a satisfying story does tend to emerge) vs plot just happens. Right now, my intuition makes me lean towards the former. Aslf's post on patterns rings true too, but again, it's a hunch for me.<br/><br/>I read Judd's old post and it made a sort of sense too, but I noticed there was talk of Narrative skills That to me sounded like an ability to finesse some structure or at least pacing into the emergent fiction.

Because we are focused on the emotional/thematic elements of the character's choices and actions (and the back and forth, up and down of successes, failures, and relentless pursuit of some need that must be fulfilled.)<br/><br/>I can go to almost any Comments section about almost any movie and find countless people talking about how the plot wasn't coherent... but the movie satisfied almost everyone else. <br/><br/>I'm not trying to put anyone on the spot to justify what the bar is for "coherence" in a plot (though I am curious what that bar is for this thread). But I felt compelled to point out that, historically, because GMs are used to "making a plot" the need to make it make sense was the focus at the expense of character choices. But if you look at how most stories really could be built, you can start with a character with a need for action of one kind or another, press them with choices that reveal who they are and how hard they'll work to get it, reach a climax of some sort where the character makes some amazing and strong life-defining choice*, and not only would you have a story, but in retrospect you would have a plot. A plot, at least, strong enough to stand up in coherence found in almost all TV shows, novels, movies and plays.<br/><br/>(*Luke Trusts the Force; Ripley goes back for Newt; John McClane surrenders to Hans Gruber after spending the whole movie needing to dominate everyone around him (yes, it's a trick, but notice that McClane never would have used such a tactic earlier in the movie); Mills falls into John Doe's trap in <i>Se7en</i> and becomes the last sin on the list; Michael lies to his wife about who he is at the end of <i>The Godfather</i>; Macbeth goes into battle even knowing he has already lost all he's cared about; the characters at the end of <i>Deadwood</i>'s run conspire to commit murder to protect one of their own; and so on...)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435761/#Comment_435761" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-25T02:27:06+00:00" title="July 25, 2014  2:27AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Absolutely.

It will become one problematic dilemma after another. One won't get anything like a coherent plot at all. <br/><br/>Here's what I say to this perceived problem: <i>Don't do that</i>.<br/><br/>That is to say, there's no reason not to think in the most human, fundamentally logical way, about what the responses of NPCs are, what the responses of PCs are, and so on. If you are disregarding the logic of human beings and a true, chained, cause-and-effect of what the characters are doing, what the responses of other characters are, back-and-forth, until the climax, you'll end up with the kind of movie we all scoff at. (See: <i>The Transformer</i> movies.)<br/><br/>So, to answer the original post (for me at least): \n<blockquote>Maybe I've misread the explanations, but it seems that this agenda could be boiled down to:<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> No railroading, or pre-planned story<br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> Address human issues (\u201cethical questions\u201d, \u201cproblematic human issues\u201d, \u201csaying something interesting about people\u201d).<br/><br/>Does <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> inherently produce a coherent plot? If not, does wanting a coherent plot fit into some other agenda?</blockquote>\nI don't think such play <i>inherently produces coherent plot</i>. I think one can screw it up. I think one can do it well. If you do it well, you get a coherent-enough plot. If you do it badly, you don't.<br/><br/>But the line isn't thin or invisible. Stick with the characters (PCs and NPCs). Think of honest, human reactions. Think in terms of honest cause and effect between choices, actions, reactions. <br/><br/>So, plot doesn't "just happen." But it's not a weird, difficult thing to reach.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer" title="Dreamer"><img alt="Dreamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer">Dreamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435770/#Comment_435770" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-25T07:29:46+00:00" title="July 25, 2014  7:29AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 25, 2014 7:36AM by Dreamer.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Loved the rest of your posts.

Or, maybe like something out of a Dario Argento movie (Suspiria). I think that movie consists of set pieces with a very thin thread of a plot running through them (<del> though I guess that's debatable</del>). [Edit: It's not debatable whether it has a plot at all.

(Surprise! They rarely did!) This, in turn, taught GMs to come up with their well plotted campaigns and adventures with the assumption that the PCs would follow along <i>because </i>everything was well plotted.<br/><br/>My own view, obviously, is that such plotting is problematic (many Players chafe against such plotting and blow up the plot anyway). And, moreover, one only needs to put pressure on the characters, let them make decisions, and the plot will be revealed in the wake of these decisions and actions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435780/#Comment_435780" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-25T10:35:20+00:00" title="July 25, 2014 10:35AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gosh, I hope not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435797/#Comment_435797" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-25T19:45:10+00:00" title="July 25, 2014  7:45PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What a great thread.<br/><br/>One thing that sometimes happens if you stick very closely to Not Railroading and Exploring Human Issues is that you'll get weird pacing.

IIRC, it was intense as hell while it was happening but it's not like you'd ever see a movie like that.

Sure, if the group is on the same page, then you can work together, but, ultimately, you're playing to find out, and that means that sometimes you end up with a novel and sometimes you end up with a short story.<br/><br/>I don't see any good way to plan out a perfect, 10-session-long game with a climax in session 9 in most Narrativism-supporting games out there. (Unless you do it by deciding ahead of time how long certain characters are in the spotlight, like Primetime Adventures - but then I'd imagine that not all of your Episodes will be exactly the same length - in television, that's something that happens in the editing room, not the first draft. And you don't get an editing room in roleplaying.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435829/#Comment_435829" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-26T20:48:13+00:00" title="July 26, 2014  8:48PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, maybe.<br/><br/>At least in my experience, those well-planned, 10-session-long games utterly depended on withholding information from the players, stalling their progress at key points, shunting them around in varying degrees of frustration.<br/><br/>Look, that Dogs game mentioned above?
