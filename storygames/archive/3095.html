Everyone gets their spotlight and everyone has their own agenda. Sometimes, in the short term, it has been different; however, I can't rightly tell if long term play would have shown the same concept. Some games expect this kind of play; I'd say that D&amp;D and PTA both do. D&amp;D in that everyone is a contributor to the tactics (maybe Clerics are side-line characters, but Wizards certainly wouldn't put that in the text). PTA in that everyone gets their own scene round-robin style (or is that just the way I've always played?)<br/><br/>Has anyone ever had an experience or fosters experiences where, either through mechanics or social contract, the game eventually focused on one character and the other players had their characters becoming supporting characters, supporting the stories and themes of a main character?<br/><br/>In terms of actual games, I think that AG&amp;G/In a Wicked Age does this, but it appears to be too rough for me to understand how Vincent wants people to play it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70785/#Comment_70785" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-21T10:24:55+00:00" title="May 21, 2007 10:24AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm wondering if this how it works for games such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer and any game based on military ranks where one person is the "captain."<br/><br/>I haven't played many of these games (although I did run an Alternity campaign for a long time with military ranks), so I'd be curious in hearing from others how they handle situations where games not only end up focused on one character, but are explicitly designed that way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70787">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70787/#Comment_70787" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-21T10:28:42+00:00" title="May 21, 2007 10:28AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As far as I know, the Buffy game considers the screen presence of each character to be up to the group, which may or may not facilitate a main character.<br/><br/>And, as for PTA, I do realize now that Screen Presence makes some characters the main character on different episodes.

Here's a bit of what we came up with:<br/><br/>Modeling the "big man and his team" in popular fiction, to whit:<br/><br/><i>Buckaroo Banzai and the Hong Kong Cavaliers<br/>Sergeant Rock and Easy Company<br/>Doc Savage and the Fabulous Five</i><br/><br/>Players choose sidekicks as their PCs and collaboratively create the big man.  When decision points are reached, there are conflicts in which each player character attempts to persuade a particular course of action on the big man.  The winner of the conflict finds the big man agreeing to his suggestion, and his own PC fades to the background as he plays the big man until the next decision point.  One cool feature of this idea is that you would have to strenuously argue for a course of action that highlighted the skills and expertise of another PC, so that yours could fade to the background as you assumed the role of the big man.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70794/#Comment_70794" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-21T10:36:49+00:00" title="May 21, 2007 10:36AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that you can do this as long as everyone buys in, and as long as the non-leader types are given the opportunity to have as much fun and impact on things as the leader.<br/><br/>One thing I briefly toyed with with Misspent Youth, for example, was to make you more effective at conflicts the cooler you were, but less able to add facts about the world or help others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70795">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70795/#Comment_70795" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-21T10:37:33+00:00" title="May 21, 2007 10:37AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joshua: Actual Play experiences, good or ill, are welcomed.<br/><br/>Jason: What would happen if the story called on the Big Guy to speak/act but there wasn't a decision point?

The decision points aren't necessarily every decision that needs to be made, but rather represent decisive changes in strategy.  Mechanically, these would be the points when another player is making a bid for control of the Big Man.<br/><br/>My only hesitation about all of this is that it sets up a competition for control among the players, which might bleed over into the narrative.

When it's occurred, it's pretty much always been in D&amp;D or Star Wars games.

So, each player gets to play one regular member of the supporting cast, and then everyone plays the main character at different times, probably using some hacked mechanic from Universalis to shuffle control around and negotiate over big decisions.<br/><br/>EDIT: Also wanted to add that instead of a Big Man getting convinced by supporting PC actions and conflicts, I'd want to take it all meta and stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70803/#Comment_70803" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-21T10:56:04+00:00" title="May 21, 2007 10:56AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 21, 2007 10:59AM by Mark_Causey.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let me take a step back here - I'm not looking for loyal and cooperative supporting cast members.

What you point out, everyone having quasi-equal numbers of framed scenes, and therefore perhaps time on stage, I think of as an unavoidable consequence of a good game that is fun for everyone.  This is definitely something that I would happily accept disagreement on, but let me explain what I mean first.<br/><br/>Let me do a nifty trick where I take an example from a game I have never played.  In Ars Magica, everyone has multiple characters; There are mages, the lieutenants and trusted agents of the mages, and the servants and chambermaids and gravediggers and such of the mages.  It's all very theatrical/Shakespearean.  One of the great virtues of the approach is that split the "party" becomes, theoretically, every player can participate in every scene.  However, as you can guess, the degree to which their participation effects the shared action of the group depends on which sort of character (mage, agent, peasant) they chose to place at the scene.  The different characters are actually a way to give all the players limited but equal (in amount) influence for their limited but equal (in value) attention.  Which is a great idea, but I think it's very crucial that, no matter how many story-pies there are and how many of your fingers are already in use, whatever new scene shows up, you can always at least play a peasant, and always feel like you're some part of whatever's going on, and always feel like you're, you know, actually playing a game or something.  Power varies, participation doesn't.<br/><br/>Stage presence, by which I mean the actual importance of a character's feelings and actions in the broader context of the game, can vary, and it's cool.  But if screen time, by which I mean the amount of time a player's character(s) spend doing cool things, is getting distributed unevenly, then I think there's a significant danger of some people feeling like they aren't playing as much or having as much fun as everyone else.  <br/><br/>Also: I doubt that, just because the characters possess organizational rank or a chain of command, their story-importance corresponds to that rank.  I've seen Wushu Matrix games where one player had the trait "I'm the Captain, and what I say goes," and he was definitely in command, but he wasn't by any means more central to the story than anyone else.  If anything, I think popular fiction is more the opposite: Dumbledore and Snape are Harry Potter's social superiors, and important characters, but by no means more important than Harry.  Carl Weathers gave Arnold orders in <i>Predator</i>, but that didn't make him the focus of the story. <br/><br/>As far as other games, I think that, in some competitive games, the 'main' character would be the one whose player is currently winning. Examples might include <i>Capes</i> and <i>Agon</i>.  But then, in the <i>Roach</i> or <i>Contenders</i>, you can lose and still be the most interesting, and therefore principal, character.<br/><br/>Actually, what I should have asked first was: What do you mean by a main character?  How would you recognize the main character of a given game/session?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70858/#Comment_70858" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-21T11:57:33+00:00" title="May 21, 2007 11:57AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 21, 2007 11:58AM by timfire.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, I have an example.

Interestingly, you might think that everyone would constantly be fighting to get control of this character. But you don't. That's not to say that this character gets played only by one player, ever, but that often there will be players who have never taken control of this main character.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen in "author" mode to the extent that Universalis puts you, I think that some people just don't mind authoring other parts of the game like the opposition for the main character. For instance there's a lot of people who vie to play the lead protagonist. But some just are content to run the extras. They still have loads of influence on how things turn out (even the destiny of the main character), so I think that mitigates any "spotlight" problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nFWIW.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70900/#Comment_70900" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-21T14:25:31+00:00" title="May 21, 2007  2:25PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark Causey</cite>Let me take a step back here - I'm not looking for loyal and cooperative supporting cast members.

Don't have the book here to check the official terminology, but basically:<br/>\n<br/>\nHeroes start with 5 Drama Points.<br/>\nSidekicks start with 10 Drama Points, *and* get twice as many Drama Points as Heroes for doing the same things.<br/>\n<br/>\nDrama Points can be spent to improve die rolls, save your butt, create a Plot Twist, and for some other things that I forget.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's a FUDGE Buffy system that I've seen which takes another tack on things -- Slayers accumulate Gloom, which penalizes them, and if they get too much, it becomes Doom, which is even worse.  The only way to get rid of Gloom is by one of the "Scoobies" having a heart-to-heart talk with the Slayer.  Of course, that requires a roll, and if it's failed, then the Slayer lashes out at her friend...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe original site for that Buffy game is long gone, but I was able to find it on the Wayback at:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030207160438/www.edromia.com/games/buffy/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://web.archive.org/web/20030207160438/www.edromia.com/games/buffy/index.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIMHO, it's a better model than the "official" one, since it seems to me to recreate the TV show (or at least, it's early seasons) more accurately -- the Scoobies can't match the Slayer for power, but without them, she'd go nuts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
