Write a scenario for use with the rules. Submit said scenario by June 15th, 2012.<br/>\n<br/>\nSubmit the scenario with the subject line \u201cHorrors in the Dark Scenario Submission\u201d by email to heroesinthedark@gmail.com, with a return receipt to ensure delivery. If the file is too big to be emailed, send, the email, but submit instead a link to the file using a file hosting service like dropbox, rapidshare, or a similar service.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere will be prizes:<br/>\n<br/>\n1st\xa0place: $100, plus copy of the deluxe hardcover version of the book.<br/>\n<br/>\n2nd\xa0place: $50, plus copy of trade paperback version of the book.<br/>\n<br/>\n3rd\xa0place: $25, plus copy of trade paperback version of the book.<br/>\n<br/>\n4th\xa0and 5th\xa0place: honorable mentions in the book.<br/>\n<br/>\nPayment will be issued via paypal. If paypal is not an option, we will work out an alternative payment method.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe winners will be chosen one month from the end of the kickstarter, and the results will be emailed to those who submitted as well as posted on the heroesinthedark.org website. The kickstarter should be well underway by the deadline for submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe five top scenarios, as well as any deemed of high enough quality, will be put into our Lovecraftian Art and Gaming book that is being produced to fund the building of a small recording studio for our registered nonprofit, Heroes in the Dark, llc. Heroes in the Dark is a registered nonprofit in the state of South Carolina. Heroes in the Dark has a simple mission: to produce audio interpretations of classic comic books for the enjoyment of blind and sight-impaired persons. Submitting a scenario grants us permission to reprint the scenarios for fundraising purposes, but grants us no ownership of the works submitted for the contest. Reprint rights expire 2 years after the end of the contest. Reprint rights extend past that date for publications created in that time period, but no new publications may be created using the scenarios past that time, unless permission is granted by the individual authors.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are a game designer with products for sale, this would be an excellent way to publicize them. All persons submitting material will have their name, contact information, and links to their products clearly noted in the book. It is our wish to extend the exposure we gain in the fundraising campaign back to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nTheme:\xa0The theme is broad\u2026Lovecraftian. There is a lot of wiggle room here.<br/>\n<br/>\nSubmission:\xa0Submit your game by midnight June 15th, 2012.. You may resubmit a replacement for your submission if you decide to revise. You may enter more than once, but no more than three times. If you miss the deadline, don\u2019t worry. We will be running this contest again in the fall. We hope to do it quarterly until the studio is funded, and afterwards if the exercise proves to be enjoyable! Games should be submitted in PDF format if possible. If not, contact me, and we will sort out a workaround.<br/>\n<br/>\nRule on Length:<br/>\nThe main text of your game should be 10,000 words or less, but you may also include additional materials in the form of maps, diagrams, play sheets, pertinent public domain or writer-owned photographs, etc. This is to allow you time to improve on your initial idea, and distill it down to a tightly written concept. There will be no formal word count. Just make sure you don\u2019t exceed the word limit by more than 10% because space in the book is at a premium.<br/>\n<br/>\nRule on Intellectual Property<br/>\nIt is the designer\u2019s responsibility to deal with all rights-related issues. Including excerpts from public domain or open source content is fine, as long as it\u2019s cited. We will reserve the right to remove content whose ownership is in question, but this removal will be discussed with the writer beforehand. If there is a glaring issue that needs to be addressed, I will ask for a revision before the rounds of polling are conducted.<br/>\n<br/>\nWho Picks the Winners?<br/>\nI will do an initial review to make sure that are no issues with legality, copyright, or obscenity. From there, I will submit the choices to the reviewers. The reviewers will consist of people who purchased the reward that allowed them to be involved in the picking of the winners. A poll will be conducted to pick the top 5 entries, and a second poll will select the top 3 for the final prize award. Please include a short paragraph pleading your case. Tell us why YOUR submission should be the winner. Extoll its virtues. Gush. Make sure we don\u2019t miss the clever intricacies of your though process.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat Happens to the Scenarios that are not Picked?<br/>\nNon-winning and winning scenarios alike are considered property of the individual writer. The submission of these scenarios is considered permission, present and future, for Heroes in the dark to publish for fundraising purposes. Funding our studio build is ultimately the point of this exercise. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut you missed something!<br/>\nIf I missed something, please let me know so that I can revise the guidelines.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_372116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jtbullet" title="jtbullet"><img alt="jtbullet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jtbullet">jtbullet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372116/#Comment_372116" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-10T10:29:51+00:00" title="April 10, 2012 10:29AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for taking the time to read about the contest. It is for a worthy cause, and the book is going to be fantastic. We have over thirty professional illustrators \u2013 from painters, to top name comic book artists, to cartoonists, contributing to the artwork. Thanks so much for your time and please feel free to ask me questions about the project. Also, I have a question for you...where else should I post the contest? So far I have posted it on yog-sothoth, rpg.net, and here. <br/>\nJarrett                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372126/#Comment_372126" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-10T11:10:53+00:00" title="April 10, 2012 11:10AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is fantastic. <br/><br/>I only have Internet access for a moment, but please do give Jarrett your support on this.

I worked considerably on polishing the posting. Unfortunately, I posted an identical one on yog-sothoth in the buy sell trade section (where it was recommended by gbsteve) but that forum is has very low traffic, and I doubt it will get the views the other threads had. The three i had before had over 1000 views before the moderators moved them into that forum.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jtbullet" title="jtbullet"><img alt="jtbullet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jtbullet">jtbullet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372957/#Comment_372957" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-15T11:02:03+00:00" title="April 15, 2012 11:02AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great news.
