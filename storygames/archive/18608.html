I'm so excited! This is real fun game to play and now that I see the actual product I know that other people will be able to do it to. <br/><br/>Yes it's a card game that does story telling but it does it in a way that is totally story game and it plays in an hour. When I ran it at Origins Games on Demand I was able to run a session of Assassin League and then do a session of Dungeon World. That is neat.<br/><br/>If you are at Gen Con please come by the Hamster Press booth (we are the ones with all the stuffed dragons) and check it out. I also got the Cthulhu Madness games (that use the same system - with different art) at the same time. <br/><br/>Neat!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
