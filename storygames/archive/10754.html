The rules are split between two trifolds and a dozen cards randomly mixed in among the playing cards. I thought that Capes was a mess in the clarity department and surely just a fluke, but apparently, dear Tony, you need somebody to edit yourself and your crazy graphic design. Please do that for your next game, Capes is already causing me more support questions than most other games we retail combined.<br/><br/>In other news, the game itself seems to be in the top five of this year's new stuff, alongside Ron Edwards (I'm not giving him two spots for <i>S/lay w/ Me</i> and <i>Trollbabe</i>) and whatever else I decide will end up there. (I'd probably pick MSG, but apparently it was published last year without anybody telling me.) I'll have to play to know for sure, but the cards are sweet enough to cause diabetes, and I really like how the structure flirts with that of teen anime without actually using prescriptive rules to emulate the media. Once you get over the representation of the rules, they seem quite intuitive and playable, too - or I might just not be understanding them. I don't <i>know</i>, really, considering how spotty the text is, so I might just be projecting a good game into these rules shards. For example, I've yet to find any text that would definitely say that high-numbered cards beat low ones in conflict, which I presume must be the way it goes. It's just "Winning card wins the stakes." Real informative, Tony.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238491/#Comment_238491" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-20T21:06:40+00:00" title="October 20, 2009  9:06PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm pretty sure that is in there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rules are totally...kind of a pain in the ass, though I do give bonus points for trying something new.

I'd hesitate making a cargo cult sale with this game, though, as I could easily see it as completely impenetrable for somebody not experienced in this sort of game.<br/><br/>The cards are the centerpiece, anyway, so I'd be happy with a conventional rules booklet in the Internet or something like that.

The blame on that lies solely with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I'd like, having said that, is to see if we can turn some of this energy toward moving forward, and developing a better, clearer set of rules.  With so much agreement that the job needs to be done, and that external editing would be a help, I'm sure we can get together something that will convey the game much better.

Where would be a good place to make the text more clear that after that first draw you only get the cards you've earned?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Horatio" title="Horatio"><img alt="Horatio" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Horatio">Horatio</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238908/#Comment_238908" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-23T13:59:04+00:00" title="October 23, 2009  1:59PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I notice that there's not a section for creating a "Dream" was that left out intentionally?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Streicher" title="Streicher"><img alt="Streicher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Streicher">Streicher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239076/#Comment_239076" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-25T16:46:35+00:00" title="October 25, 2009  4:46PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's more clear now.

That way there's a clear distinction:  This is the stuff you can't play without, whereas this other stuff is meant to help but can be left to later if you just want to start with the lightest possible system.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239150/#Comment_239150" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-26T10:17:33+00:00" title="October 26, 2009 10:17AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Streicher</cite>If you play with 3 or 4 players, won't it be easier to play without scenes?

But yes, I would suggest that with a large number of players around the table, the GM will probably do better (strategically) to use the non-phased rules, and work his butt off to spend cards quickly by challenging the players and drawing them into conflicts, then use his ability to call a draw when he can do so to advantage.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Streicher</cite>But I have talked with a friend, who also bought the game, this weekend.

I thought people would want a nice, non-conflicty entry into the story by introducing their characters, and so I started without starting hands, but feedback has been overwhelmingly that they want to be able to get into trouble right off the bat.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Streicher</cite>Also he has a piece of paper where it says, that the higher rated card wins a conflict. I'm missing that one.</blockquote>Ah!  Then you bought very early.  Good for you.  Those errata slips got into the decks as fast as ever I could print them, but some people managed to get the decks before I realized the flub.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Streicher</cite>Also the rules don't make it explizit that the other players give out a card from the deck, if somebody has played their personality, or from their own hand.

I'll clarify that in the codex version.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_239964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239964/#Comment_239964" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-31T21:52:27+00:00" title="October 31, 2009  9:52PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            i'm in no place to jump in: i'm unfamiliar with the game &amp; far from a copy or the ability to recieve mail,<br>but i'm so, so glad this is happening right now! <br><br/>Thanks, Tony, for accepting assistance (though it sounds like that was never the issue) &amp; thanks helping hands<br/>for cutting away the dross.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
