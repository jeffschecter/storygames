I'm really appreciating the thoughtful commentary.<br><br>A couple of things:<br><br>1) I thought I heard one of you mention playing with three Crimes your Short Story. Did I hear that correctly? Because you're only supposed to use two. As you all discussed, there is less room for error in a Short Story, but three Crimes would seem to make that even more complex.<br><br>2) I found the discussion of gaming in "your home town, last week" in the southern California sprawl very interesting, especially in light of both the history of the genre, which has many ties to your specific area, as Jesse noted. As I recall, the movies <i>Crash</i> and <i>Collateral</i> both cite this sense of disconnectedness, but I wasn't sure if that was just being played for effect or whatnot. Since it does seem to have some basis in reality, I can see how it could definitely make those sorts of connections more difficult. I guess my advice would be to treat that entire sprawl as "your home town" and game there...which is pretty much what you're doing, it seems like. The point of this feature of the game is actually to make the setting both easier to comprehend and more likely to "pop" with little details and the like. It then becomes both a celebration of sorts of your shared environment and also an opportunity to share more with each other about your environment. Now, given the 200-mile radius that you're traveling (!!!), that second feature might end up being less important (though I can tell that Jesse is just <i>dying</i> to slip that coffee house into a game). But still, at the very least, I'd imagine that you all share a common experience of (say) the famous L.A. freeways or the impact of that sprawl (both geographic and cultural) on everyday life. Those factors are just as significant in your psychological geography as is the impact of the Illinois River on the psychological geography of Peoria and the surrounding environs.<br><br>Personally, I'd love to play an interlocking series of games all set in Peoria and then use Google Earth to store the locations (and timestamps, as appropriate) of significant locations and events that arose in the games. Over time, this fictional "Peoria" would increasingly diverge from the actual Peoria, but that would be okay, as it would be our evolving setting. Of course, I also like driving past areas in Peoria where stuff has happened in our games and remembering what "happened" over there. It's not quite pervasive gaming, but there it is.<br><br>3) True confession: I've never played with a recurring investigator. Indeed, all the variant rules are ones that seemed functional, but I've not used them myself. (Funny aside: the corrupt investigator rules were the result of an error during a playtest which seemed to work out well. So I went with it.) So, I found Laura's thoughts on the impact of the recurring investigator to be really interesting. In my play of the game, I've been happiest when I was getting a good sense of who the investigator is as a person, not just as the force that is pursuing judgment. And, it would seem that spending more time with a character would allow that sense to develop more. So I think it's really cool that it's working out that way.<br><br>In general, <i>Dirty Secrets</i> is full of material that will be seized upon differently by different groups. For that matter, the level of engagement with a certain aspect of the game can change from story to story. I see the "your town, last week" aspect of the game as being similar to the Demographics. Sometimes, it will just be the backdrop to the story, and that's all it ever is. Sometimes, a certain geographic detail can have deeper meaning to someone, and that becomes significant. I don't think that it's worth it to try to force your game to be a commentary on your home town or a fictional expose. Just go with what seems natural to say, based on where you live. Whatever comes of it, comes of it.<br><br>As an aside, I've found that this feature of <i>Dirty Secrets</i> has encouraged me to pay closer attention to what happens around me in my city. For a while, as I was passing through the city, I'd be logging away neat locations to pull out in the next game of <i>Dirty Secrets</i>. Over time, this has evolved into generally being interested with the nooks and crannies of my city. I didn't design <i>Dirty Secrets</i> because I was connected to Peoria; I connected to Peoria because I designed <i>Dirty Secrets</i>.<br><br>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278328/#Comment_278328" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T12:19:27+00:00" title="June 28, 2010 12:19PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seth,<br/><br/>1) We played the Short Story with only two crimes.  It's possible someone misspoke since we played with three crimes in the Novella the session before.  We also conceptually had three crimes in the short story.  The two Crimes solved by the rules and then the murder of James Cameron which was intentionally never addressed directly and never resolved which was very neat and very cool.<br/><br/>2) Will is an hour and half north of me.  Sean and Anna are about 45 minutes south of me.  So... yeah.  And the L.A./SoCal Sprawl reputation is NO JOKE.  There are pockets of local culture if you stop to look.  But if you're not paying attention you wouldn't really notice.  You'd think it was all just one giant thing.<br/><br/>Dirty Secrets makes me feel guilty that me and the coffee shop is about all I know about my local culture.

But, as I say, playing <i>Dirty Secrets</i> became a prompt for me to be more aware of what is going on right in my own backyard. Maybe it'll be the same for you. ;-)<br/><br/>(I've actually found that the process of game design has always had a significant impact on my personality and outlook on life.

It sounds so soulless and unsocial. I would go completely insane living in a community where I didn't know my neighbours.<br/><br/>Though I do feel there is plenty of opportunity for crime and mischief in these suburban sprawls.  Isn't that the whole theme of American Beauty?  Breaking Bad deals with it as well (though the protagonist goes outside his enclave to find the real trouble).    And what about the Jon-Benet Ramsey case?  That was some horrible, noir shit right there in the heart of suburbia.<br/><br/>I'm reminded of Conan Doyle's dark treatise on the countryside in The Mystery of Copper Beeches.  Just replace suburbs with countryside and you'll get the idea:\n<blockquote>By eleven o'clock the next day we were well upon our way to the old English capital. Holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the way down, but after we had passed the Hampshire border he threw them down and began to admire the scenery. It was an ideal spring day, a light blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east. The sun was shining very brightly, and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air, which set an edge to a man's energy. All over the countryside, away to the rolling hills around Aldershot, the little red and gray roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from amid the light green of the new foliage.<br/><br/>"Are they not fresh and beautiful?" I cried with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.<br/><br/>But Holmes shook his head gravely.<br/><br/>"Do you know, Watson," said he, "that it is one of the curses of a mind with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with reference to my own special subject. You look at these scattered houses, and you are impressed by their beauty. I look at them, and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there."<br/><br/>"Good heavens!" I cried. "Who would associate crime with these dear old homesteads?"<br/><br/>"They always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief, Watson, founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside."<br/><br/>"You horrify me!"<br/><br/>"But the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish. There is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of a drunkard's blow, does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours, and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it going, and there is but a step between the crime and the dock. But look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law. Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on, year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser.

One of my big culture shock moments was when I was sitting around with some of the more home grown students deciding what to do.  One student offers a suggestion and another says, "Eh.  I don't know.  It's kind of far away."  So I asked, "Well, how far are we talking."  He replied, "Like 20 minutes.".<br/><br/>The shear exhaustion with which he said it just blew my mind.  In High School my nearest *friend* was 20 minutes away and my girlfriend was closer to 40 minutes away.  And all our late night hang outs?  On the other side of a mountain.  So to me, 20 minutes IS next door.  It was not uncommon for me to drive over 100 miles in an evening gathering (and returning) all my friends since I was the one with the license and the parents willing to lend me the car.<br/><br/>Also, I guess I've grown pretty institutionalized on the whole setup.  The thought of walking out side and unexpectedly hearing, "Oh, hey there, Jesse, how's it going?" kind of makes me twitch.  Like you kind of just poked me unpleasantly with a stick.

I'm originally from Erie, PA, so I'm curious....<br/><br/>Anyways, when I moved to Peoria, I coined the term "psychological geography" to describe exactly this phenomenon. How far is "far"? The answer is complicated and depends on both the physical layout of the land (like, say, a river being in the way) and the mentality that develops around that. Here in <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Peoria,+Illinois&amp;ll=40.679076,-89.588699&amp;spn=0.451473,0.891953&amp;z=11" rel="nofollow">Peoria</a>, the Illinois River is a major divide. Even though there are four bridges in the city proper, which another two within 20 minutes down-river, crossing to the "other side" of the river counts as far away, even if the mileage is less so. And, of course, you get the arguments about which side of the river is better. (Personally, since most of the tornadoes are on the east side of the river, I'm thinking I like my side better.)<br/><br/>To make this gaming related, those are the kinds of details that only a native understands. And those are the kinds of details that help bring life to a game of <i>Dirty Secrets</i>, maybe even without your realizing it.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278371/#Comment_278371" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T14:18:46+00:00" title="June 28, 2010  2:18PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lafayette College in Easton.<br/><br/>Another cultural shock was that I could *walk* to New Jersey if I wanted to.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278705/#Comment_278705" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-30T03:34:36+00:00" title="June 30, 2010  3:34AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse, this podcast has helped me see clearly that I'd have a very similar issue.
