In the olden days when my Prime Minister was an evil hag-woman and your President was a dead movie star, optional rules could be found everywhere. Look at AD&amp;D 2nd edition. You had five different ways to roll up your stats, two wholly separate skill systems, optional weapons vs armour tables, called shots, critical hits, the works. All of these options were considered to be within the authority of the GM to implement or not at his discretion. If you were a player you might not even have been aware that your game used the optional Plasma Disintegration rules until your GM rolled that 20 that time and got that funny look in his eye. Towards the end of this period you even had whole supplement chains devoted to list after list of optional rules - consider the 3 AD&amp;D's Player's Option books, and all 17 Rolemaster Companions. With the advent of D&amp;D 3, D&amp;D 4, and the whole creator control/system matters/laser focus thing, this pattern seems to have slowed down quite significantly. <br/><br/>So I guess my question is this: are optional rules a good thing or a bad thing? To what extent are they supportive of diversity and customisation within the player base? To what extent do they simply represent an abrogation of responsibility on the part of the designer? Is there a particular type of game that especially benefits - or suffers - from their inclusion? How should they be presented within the text?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207169/#Comment_207169" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-13T16:13:06+00:00" title="May 13, 2009  4:13PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't like optional rules that make the game appear like it's trying to be all things to all people.

There was a lot of hand-wavy talk about making the game into "your own" with no discussion about what that really meant.  Basically, these games require you to be game designers to play and then utterly failed to teach you game design.<br/><br/>I remember spending hours and hours and hours in High School studying certain games and trying to figure out how to play them "correctly."  What I wanted was to play these games in their "pure" form.

I viewed them like expansions and that a "real" player of the game used them all in full all the time.  I thought that "the" game of D&amp;D was SO HUGE that they had to release it in pieces so that you could take it in bit by bit and I wanted to play the WHOLE game.<br/><br/>I'm not making this up.  I really thought like that.<br/><br/>I eventually gave up and left the hobby.  I came back precisely because we now have games that when you do what the text says (or at least what the designer clarifies), they work.  You don't have to finish designing them.<br/><br/>I "get" the toolbox thing.

It was very "cargo-culty", and gained mostly through second- or tenth -hand knowledge. It just happened that the particular early influences on my gaming favored the "almost everything herein is optional" approach over the "This is a <b>game</b>, and games have important strictures" ( although I did, later, pick up some of that).<br/><br/>Strangely, that only ever really applied to RPGs, in my mind.<br/><br/>Edit:<br/><br/>On further consideration, I think most rules (optional or otherwise) of Mainstream ( not Dirty Hippy ) games boil down to a designer thinking <i>"Wouldn't it be cool if [blank] happened!!! But, like, not all the time, because then it wouldn't be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">cool</span>!"</i><br/><br/>What is interesting to me is reading more mainstream games, ansd suddenly looking at mechanics through that particular lens. <i>"What if the adventures were riding through the countryside and were suddenly set upon by owlbears! That would be so cool!! But not all the time! Then it wouldn't be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">cool</span>.

I want to leave my decision-making process in the actual session of the game, whether that's play, character, or world creation.

Did you find the optional rules annoying? I put them in there in full honesty - each and every rule is one I might imagine pulling myself for the right group and the right time. The difference between the optional rules and the main stream of the rules text in SS is pretty much pedagogical only: the main text is what I instruct you to do if you don't know what you're doing, the optional stuff is what I suggest if you know the basic stuff and want to do something else.<br/><br/>Ending up with lots of optional rules was quite strange, as I myself despise lazy design and rules that have so little significance that the designer can just drop them without losing the aesthetic integrity of his game system. It was interesting that when I started writing SS I actually knew the rules-system so well that I could know pretty exactly which things in the rules are just conventions that get us from point A to point B and could be replaced with something else (the chargen is full of this stuff; it's almost arbitrary in SS as long as it produces characters that fulfill certain basic criteria), and which were actually important to do just so and not any which way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207300/#Comment_207300" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-14T09:25:24+00:00" title="May 14, 2009  9:25AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm finding it strange that some people feel like optional rules mean that they have to "build their own game" or that the designer "didn't finish" or something.  Maybe I have a different understanding of the term "optional rule."  What I think of when I hear it is that the game is complete.  There are a set of rules that are the "standard rules" and if you follow them the game works.  There are <i>also</i> other rules that you can either add on or that can replace some of the standard rules.  These rules are optional.  If you don't even want to read them, you don't have to and the game will work just fine with the standard rules.  But if you want to change up somethings and wan to do so with official changes rather than making up your own shit, you can use some or all of the optional rules.<br/><br/>That's how I think of optional rules.  If a game is like that, and has optional rules like that, that's totally awesome.  I agree that I don't want a game that says, "You can do it like this, or like this, or like this, or like that.  I'm not going to tell you which to pick.  Pick whichever you want."  That would annoy me.  I want a baseline, and other things I can use to add on or swap out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_207406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soviet" title="soviet"><img alt="soviet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/715/nBVUFTQIKLVIT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soviet">soviet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207406/#Comment_207406" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-14T14:25:44+00:00" title="May 14, 2009  2:25PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><br/>Fuck the designer, who cares what they thought or think.</blockquote>\nWell, I care.

But I think in those cases it's incumbent on the designer to say why this rule is optional (as opposed to being core) and what effect implementing it will have on play ("Turn this dial to 11 if you want your PCs to be constantly scared of dying"). Not to mention playtesting them and making sure they work as stated. Otherwise it's tantamount to giving up. It's just throwing shit at the wall and seeing what sticks. <br/><br/>See, I'm designing a game (Other Worlds). I've had a bunch of playtest feedback and I'm considering making a few changes as a result (see concurrent thread). But not all the changes I'm considering, or the problems they address, are going to be relevant to every group. Some groups might even find that my changes actively serve to reduce the amount of fun they were having before. And that's unfortunate. So in a lot of ways it's very tempting to just say the magic words 'optional rule', wash my hands of all responsibility, and let people sort this shit out for themselves. <br/><br/>But as I said before, I think that would be a mistake. I think that my responsibility as a games designer is to have a specific vision of how my game is supposed to play and then make sure that every component works towards achieving that vision. My job is to make hard choices and present them as a (hopefully) coherent and functioning game engine. Putting in optional nightfighting rules, or whatever, would tend to interfere with that. <br/><br/>That's what I think, anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_207438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207438/#Comment_207438" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-14T16:05:24+00:00" title="May 14, 2009  4:05PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love optional rules, and I think they're best when what they will do is clearly labeled. i.e. "for a shorter game, use this rule" "if you want to make combats last longer, add this rule"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207440/#Comment_207440" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-14T16:06:51+00:00" title="May 14, 2009  4:06PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: soviet</cite>Well, I care.

That's a very sort of 1980s approach in some ways, with a bit of a hippy spin. The games I'm thinking of from the 80s would tend to have an RPG, and then also a companion wargame (or maybe the other way around), for example.<br/><br/>Space 1889, and several FASA games would be examples, and probably VtM+ 1st ed MET Masquerade as ( although early 90s).

I run a fairly quick-and-easy campaign, so I don't need so much detail in my fights. Heck, most of the time I use Unworthy Opponents! So labelling the advanced combat stuff as optional works great for me - it tells me that the game runs perfectly well without them, but if I ever want to dial up the detail in combats then they are there, ready for use.<br/><br/>D&amp;D 3.5 didn't have anything like this, and so all sorts of problems popped up when you tried to run quick-and-easy combats - you try to omit some fiddly little rule that didn;t seem like much fun, and then suddenly the whole thing cascades and you've got a fifteen-minute debate about attacks of opportunity and moving along the hypotenuse. Great.<br/><br/>If I see an optional rule then I read it knowing that I can assess how important it will be t the game <i>I</i> want to run, and then include it or omit it as desired. That's a useful thing!

The system as a whole tries to work for every imaginable setting and genre, but some optional rules are marked as appropriate for some cases, and a subset of those notes include discussion of why the rules are or are not suitable. I don't have my rulebooks handy, but I seem to recall a specific note about the Hit Location Chart being unsuitable for superhero games, because it made combat shorter, grittier, and more lethal.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit: A big part of my frustration with optional rules is that it's difficult to discuss which ones are in use and which ones aren't for a given game until you need to use them, and then it's too late. For something as large as Hero, I'd love to see the rules encoded in a computer program or smart document. Let the GM go through the text marking which optional rules he wants, then generate some sort of code that all the players can plug in which makes their rulebooks show the options that are in force and hide the ones that aren't.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this what The Right To Dream means? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207614/#Comment_207614" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-15T11:32:56+00:00" title="May 15, 2009 11:32AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: timfire</cite><br>Here's the issue---can anyone actually name a game that does that?

Those who disagree are demanding prima donnas who fail to truly appreciate the game design and its artistic vision of genre flexibility and character portability between campaigns.<br/><br/>Fortunately, a LARGE bulk of the rules content that isn't just "this Ability does FOO to BAR" is going to be explanations of what high and low values and what an Ability's various Options (or whole game's Toggles!) means for gameplay: clarity and speed of play, verisimilitude, and lethality.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jlarke</cite>For something as large as Hero, I'd love to see the rules encoded in a computer program or smart document.</blockquote>FYI, that's what the Campaign Sheet in the back of 4E was for: listing the legal Powers, etc, their maximum Active Points, player Exp to build, etc.<br/><br/>But if it just HAS to be automated, then you'll LOVE GLASS Cutters, once it's fully functional:<br/>* Set game Toggles, Ability Up Cost maximums (-1 = not allowed), and the various Ability Options and Toggles, for your (the GM's) game type.<br/>* The character creator, then, will only permit character legal for that game.<br/>* Legality can be cost-associated or even nested: I could say "my game uses My Game rules OR Bob's Game Rules, so we can share characters; and I could say "My Game uses the Game Toggles for Bob's Game, but the Ability rules (as applicable) from Chad's Game.<br/>* As a plus, because shotGLASS is a free PDF anyway (just a rules reference, with no layout or fictional fluff, no examples, no artwork, and no explanations of what various Toggle and Options "feel" like), I'd like the Game and Character Database to print out--on the fly (or build once a game type is saved)--a PDF with ALL and ONLY the rules in effect for that game type, including level limits/Up Cost limits, Templates and Packages (and whether they are suggested Abilities and Ability sets, or the only Abilities allowed), etc. Basically, every game type would have its own custom PDF generated by the DB.<br/><br/>Yep... just gotta get out of Gold Master... :}                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208193/#Comment_208193" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-19T14:41:41+00:00" title="May 19, 2009  2:41PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 19, 2009 2:41PM by JDCorley.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric</cite>makes it difficult to me to believe that what you think you want has much to do with what is actually going to make you happy or work out well.</blockquote>\nRight, otherwise I would be perfect in every way and never make any mistakes (no smart remarks from the peanut gallery.)

I did not mind the optional rules. In fact, I enjoyed them. <br/><br/>The reasons I did not mind the optional rules is pretty much for the reasons you give here -- you didn't just randomly and indecisively cram options in, you took a deeper look at the system and thought about it in terms of versatility within core competency and designed for that. They aren't "do it yourself" they are "when you have a level of mastery, here are some ways you can move things around that don't violate the game but do give it flexibility." <br/><br/>Hell, in many ways I consider that a higher level of design. Being able to design solidly and with understanding, but still giving flexibility in a well defined and constructed framework seems much more difficult and worthy a job than making a design that works only one exceedingly narrow way. Making a game that is designed to do one thing is cool, designing a game that is -- by design and not accident and not "you make it up" -- a little more flexible is cool plus awesome. <br/><br/>So rather than say "yay/nay optional rules rule/suck" I'm going to have to go back to my old hobby horse and say its all fucking contextual. (Why do I always have to say this?) Optional rules to mask weak design or as a "just do whatever you want" are, usually, pretty lame. But not all optional rules are that. Some optional rules expand and further a game by designing the game for flexibility rather than designing for inflexibility or designing for the group to do whatever. <br/><br/>That last thing, its hard to do, but it isn't impossible. And when its done right, its pretty cool. <br/><br/>So, I'll answer: "Optional rules -- why are you using them and what is their actual impact upon play and the distribution of authority because without talking about that to give some context to the answer its just a bunch of theory wanking."<br/><br/>So could we maybe talk a little bit about games that actually have optional rules, and how they do or do not work for us?

Rather than making endless sweeping statements of theoretical ideals?<br/></blockquote>\nThe context for me is that I am looking at some post-playtest changes to make to my game Other Worlds (see concurrent thread). During a conflict, the system as written basically expects players to use their discretion when deciding how many related abilities they want to bring in and get little bonuses for. The problem is that this doesn't always seem to work out so well in practice and conflicts could easily get bogged down as a result. The solution I posted was to limit the number of related abilities that could be brought in to a maximum of 3, with the option of spending a point of metagame currency to ignore this restriction for one particular conflict. <br/><br/>For groups that experienced this slow-down problem, this limit is probably a good rule. It keeps things moving and lets people know exactly where the line is in terms of how many supporting abilities are generally acceptable. Moreover, it gives players explicit permission to bring in everything and the kitchen sink when it would be dramatically appropriate to do so, because it charges them a small fee for the privilege. <br/><br/>But for groups that didn't experience this slow-down problem, the limit could be seen as a bad rule. It's setting a hard but arbitrary limit on something that they were already self-policing pretty effectively. <br/><br/>So the question becomes, do you introduce a limit (thereby solving group A's problem but getting slightly in the way of group B's fun)? Or do you make the limit an optional rule, for As and Bs to implement or ignore at their leisure. Would that be an abdication of my responsibility as the game's designer? Should I leave the potential problem unfixed because some groups find their own workarounds? How big does group A or group B have to get before I should start taking their needs into account? How do people know whether they are in group A or B and thus whether they should implement the rule? Should I just implement the rules I use in my own game sessions?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208222/#Comment_208222" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-19T17:34:35+00:00" title="May 19, 2009  5:34PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 19, 2009 5:36PM by Brand_Robins.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Depends, I guess. <br/><br/>Do you think you can set the rule within the text in such a way that it is obvious when and why you would use the rule, and what (exactly) the affect that it will have on play will be?<br/><br/>If you can do so, then its probably fine to do so. If you think that it will make things awkward, or that it might have consequences you might not understand, then I'd leave it out. <br/><br/>Personally, from what you just wrote, if there was a little sidebar that pretty much said "if the number of related abilities is causing slow down, limit them to 3. Doing this will speed up play, at the cost of X or Y changes in the way conflicts work" I'd be happier than not. Because at that point it doesn't feel like it is "weakness of vision" as much as it feels like "these things both work, and understanding that both are options may make it easier to play." <br/><br/>An example of where it would annoy me is if the rule was "only 3" and you set your probabilities on that, playtested only that, and then had an optional rule to "just use as many as you want" without any understanding of how it would change the game. That is weak design. Or if you put in the rule of 3 without having tested what it did, just because "some people may like it." <br/><br/>But as it is, it sounds like you've got pretty specific reasons for the rules and (probably) a good understanding of how it works and the different social situations that the rule does or does not need to be applied to. Of course, I'd have to actually see it in text before I know for sure, but that's my gut feeling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad" title="Caesar Slaad"><img alt="Caesar Slaad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad">Caesar Slaad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208267/#Comment_208267" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-20T05:04:43+00:00" title="May 20, 2009  5:04AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            *deposit two cents*<br/><br/>Generally, I find optional rules a good thing.

Rather than making endless sweeping statements of theoretical ideals?</blockquote>\nD&amp;D 4E has a core idea called a 'quest' -- basically, the reason for the adventure.  It has mechanical weight in the form of an XP award.  I think this is a great thing, because it's an up-front and explicit statement of the game's content that can anticipate and frontload expectation clashes. In addition to the XP scoring rules, there's guidelines for what constitutes a quest, how to design them, how multiple or conflicting quests ought to interact -- it's pretty cool stuff.<br/><br/>The really nifty optional part is on P103 of the DMG.  I really hope it's in the PHB too, but haven't the time to check.  That page suggests that DMs 'allow and even encourage' players to generate their own quests that can have the same significance as GM-made quests.<br/><br/>With that one paragraph, the game remains mechanically identical, but its power dynamics can be fundamentally changed.  In actual play, I think it's worked great for us; we've had quests come out of modules and quests come from me ( I'm the DM ) and quests declared in-the-moment by players - which is really really great affirmation for the present and compass for the future.<br/><br/>Another nifty thing: this rule appears to be not merely optional, but actually hyperoptional.  We don't have to have buy-in from the whole table to use it.  Just the DM + one other player needs to participate for it to work.  At our table, some players just aren't interested in generating their own quests, and the game still runs smoothly.<br/><br/>The one deficiency I see with this rule is that I wish it went a little further and gave guidance or procedures about how to reconcile player and DM quests into a coherent whole that can entertain everyone -- something akin to ( my perhaps imagined ) advice in IAWA about how to weave oracles together.  Maybe in DMG2?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208360/#Comment_208360" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-20T14:20:50+00:00" title="May 20, 2009  2:20PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 20, 2009 2:28PM by David Artman.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, actual options and why?<br/>GLASS:<br/>* Player v World Priority Toggle - The former gives the choice of risking death exclusively to an individual player (Commit, and receive full Health and Natural Armor back... but now 0 Health is Dead, not Unconscious, for a limited but not short time period); the latter makes it so that any entity can kill a PC "Dead" by doing a killing blow while the PC is incapacitated (unconscious or totally bound). The former makes for more heroic and dramatic games--the death-risk only happens when it means something to the player--while the latter can make for more capricious deaths.<br/>** Resurrection - Only available in World Priority games, to keep from weakening the death-risk of Committing in Player Priority. Within Resurrection, there are several Toggles and a couple of Options:<br/>*** No Resurrect - Want a "realistic" game where death can be ignoble or worthy? Use the No Resurrect Toggle.<br/>*** Resurrect Location - Hospital, temple, whatever: you Die and you'll need friends to get you to the location. Obviously, this encourages grouping or, at the least, only soloing when you're in a common traffic area.<br/>*** Resurrect Ability - If someone buys it, they can Res another player, anywhere, any time. This is for High Magic/Faith or Super Science games where death is merely an inconvenience and a delay.<br/>**** Resurrect Timer - No matter the Toggle above, this Option sets a ticking clock after which you can't be Res, period. Five to ten minutes to get to the location or to be touched with the hand of life... or make a new guy.<br/>**** Resurrect Risk - No matter the Toggle or Option above, there's a risk to resurrecting: anywhere from 10 to 100% chance that you'll suffer a Defect worth from 10 to 60 Exp (but you don't get the Exp bonus for receiving it!). For games where being "mostly dead" has its price, no matter how you made it back from the veil. And note that this Option has "sliders," so it's more like about 30 Options in one.<br/><br/>Every choice of Toggle above, and every Option checked on, changes the relative risks for characters in-game, and that in turn suffuses the game world with a certain tone (in fact, I used to have all of them "fixed" in particular configurations, and called it "Tone," before I decided to kill Tone as a game setup Toggle and let it emerge through combinations of Toggles and Options).<br/><br/>Or...<br/><br/>Earning Experience<br/>* Variable Gain - An Option that say if you do something that advances the game (kill enemies, find information, solve puzzles, role play), you get Exp. Bog-standard.<br/>* Static Gain - An Option that gives X Exp to all participants, every Reset. Good for games with a lot of socializing and politicking and, thus, difficult to quantify "accomplishments." Also a cookie for wall flowers.<br/>--- Note that they are both Options, so they can both be on (or off--No Exp ever). Toggles are like radio buttons in computer GUIs: only one can be on in a given game.<br/><br/>Spending Experience:<br/>* Zero Growth - This Toggle requires all Earned Exp to be spent on Single Use Abilities (ex: potions), Foci, or Tools; it reflects a game world where the PCs have all the "juice" they're going to ever effectively have, and must "tool up" to become stronger. Perfect for CoC-style play, or real-time games (where, c'mon, there's no way someone goes from pencil neck to bodybuilder in a week of game session!).<br/>* Balanced Growth - This Toggle means all Exp spent must have an equivalent Defect (with no Bonus Exp for the Defect). Great for games where "power corrupts" or "degenerates" those who try to wield more of it. Also GREAT for games with frequent new PCs, as no one's net Exp total changes; also simulates "aging" fairly loosely.<br/>* Constrained Growth - This Toggle means new Abilities and Attribute increases cost more and more, the more net total Exp a PC has. It simulates not only an inherent "maximum capacity to learn and do" (i.e. realism) it also helps keep games on a level-ish playing field, between veterans and newbies. When the field ISN'T level (Rank 3 v Rank 1), it provides a metric for GMs to use to direct advanced players to advanced content (and away from beginner content) and vice versa.<br/>* Unlimited Growth - This Toggle is the bog-standard: spend it when you get it, and God save the GMs when you have combat monsters and high mages wander amongst the conscripts and hedge wizards. But, hey, some folks dig that shit, so I have it there.<br/>-----<br/>I think this shows that--far from throwing a tool kit with no labels--GLASS provides a set of Toggles and Options which, based on how they are set, utterly change the game play in demonstrable ways, which in turn can impact the tone and styles of play as folks react to the relative lethality and rates of advancement.<br/><br/>And I didn't even START to talk about Ability Advantages and Limitations, which let you tune a specific power or spell or feat to do EXACTLY what you imagine (in game-mechanical terms, if not precise simulation).<br/><br/>Yep... HERO for LARP, specially tuned for (US) LARP expectations, styles, and preferences. Just not possible without "optional rules"... or, rather, I could release something like 40 retoolings of it, to reflect various option combos (not to mention pre-defined Ability to reinforce genre conventions).

It's not a sandbox-style use-what-you-like set of rules. Instead, it's presented as a set of core mechanics (character creation, universal conflict resolution, reward mechanic, plus a few other things). <br/><br/>Following that, there are subsequent chapters where more detailed rules modules are presented: Advanced combat, ranged combat, social combat (the infamous "Duel of Wits") and magic.<br/><br/>In the rules text, Luke Crane (the game designer) is specific about WHY and WHEN you should use the advanced/optional rules. <br/><br/>My first BW campaign was a royal mess, because I didn't really take the game designer's notes at face value, and threw all the rules in. In my current BW campaign, we have been playing for a while, and have not even used most of the extra rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soviet" title="soviet"><img alt="soviet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/715/nBVUFTQIKLVIT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soviet">soviet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208761/#Comment_208761" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-22T17:00:54+00:00" title="May 22, 2009  5:00PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Funnily enough, I think of BW as a good example of a game that doesn't use any optional rules. It's a single tightly designed engine that does all the things it needs to. <br/><br/>Optional rules to me are a way of consciously making your game incomplete. Instead of presenting a single coherent mode of play, you are issuing a set of tools for people to use and expecting them to build their own. <br/><br/>I think subsystems like Duel of Wits and Fight! are something different. I mean yeah, you choose whether or not you will use them, but this is no different to those times when you decide to narrate something rather than rolling for it. I think the key distinction is that the decision is made at the table and on a case by case basis. It's an extension of the core engine that you can roll out when it would be appropriate for the situation. <br/><br/>You can't really do that sort of thing with encumbrance rules or optional critical hit tables or the like, because their inclusion or not has a wider impact on the nature of the system. They either apply, or they don't; there's no middle ground.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html

A game is not a script. But the text directly focuses and drives the play by establishing (at least some of) the ingredients and setting the tone for how they will be explored. <br/><br/>Let's build on your example of Dogs. Can every possible game session be directly predicted from the text? No, of course not. But can the basic tone and content of a standard game session be predicted from the text? Yes, it can. The nature of the game is clearly communicated before play by the text and clearly reinforced during play by the system. If I agree to play in a game of Dogs, I know eactly what kind of game I am going to get. <br/><br/>The town rules might not 'tell you what town you will be playing in or even what the sins of that town are', but they certainly do tell you that there will be a town and a bunch of sins to explore. The character generation rules might not create your character for you, but they certainly do make sure that your character has relationships, authority, and some kind of moral code. The conflict resolution rules might not tell you how every scene will end up, but they certainly do make sure you will have some difficult decisions to make about when to escalate. <br/><br/>Would Dogs be improved by the addition of optional rules about pacifism, magic, and objective morality? What if the escalation rules themselves were optional? What if PCs who belonged to the optional Priest class could call on holy magic to raise the dead and change people's minds? What if the optional adventuring rules let you explore haunted Indian burial grounds for fun and profit?<br/><br/>Wouldn't all of these things dilute the focus of the game and turn it into something else?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208838/#Comment_208838" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-23T22:08:46+00:00" title="May 23, 2009 10:08PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The difference in experience between playing through a town whose sins revolve around sexual exploitation and a town whose sins revolve around mob mentality is so gigantically huge that the Indian burial ground rules hack you pooh-pooh would seem modest, even trifling in comparison.<br/><br/>At any rate, all such towns, characters and dilemmas are brought to the text by the players.

Exploring issues of justice and morality vis a vis sexual exploitation is so different from exploring the same issue vis a vis mob mentality that you might as well be playing a D&amp;D style dungeon crawl? In fact the dungeon crawl would be closer? That makes no sense whatsoever. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><br/>At any rate, all such towns, characters and dilemmas are brought to the text by the players.</blockquote>\nNo they're not. The book contains example towns and specific instructions on how to build your own town - it doesn't just handwave it and say 'do whatever'. The book gives you freedom to create your own character but also sets very clear parameters as to what kind of character it needs to be - you cannot create a simple blacksmith who just wants a quiet life, for example. The dilemmas are created by combining the problems of the town (provided by, or at least heavily informed by, the book), the nature of the characters position (set by the book), and the ramifications of the escalation mechanic (set by the book).<br/><br/>GURPS Wild West would not provide the same results. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><br/>Just as they would (should) bring some understanding of what they want from the game sufficient to know what optional rules would be appropriate.</blockquote>\nWhy should they have to?

Because the game recognizes that player modification of the game is both desirable and necessary for play.<br/><br/>I don't particularly think the Indian burial ground rules hack you propose would be a very good optional rule but I can certainly envision a game in which a town has transgressed against the code of the Mountain People (which of course they can do with impunity) but having done so they have gained hubris and begun to transgress against the Book of Life, and a big part of handling the situation of that town might be exploring a burial ground for information and it could be a great setting for confrontation. So no, I don't see it as any big thing to concoct a "physical investigation" mini-game which might supplement the  "everyone runs up and tells you everything" rule in the main book. Many groups might like it! I know you would hate it, and spit on those groups, and kick them, but as they lay writhing in pain under your righteous boot of fury they might gasp "we only wanted to have a bit of extra fun with Dogs in the Vineyard...we meant you no harm..."  Then they would die and no jury would convict you.<br/><br/>An optional rule is optional.

Because, um, I don't agree with that statement. I think that doing more things comes at a cost. That cost is doing those things less well, either because of a lack of focus on any one particular thing, or because of a lack of clarity as to what the game is actually supposed to be about. I don't want to pay that cost. I don't want to compromise. I think that optional rules are a form of compromise. <br/><br/>I stand by what I said in the OP: "I think that my responsibility as a games designer is to have a specific vision of how my game is supposed to play and then make sure that every component works towards achieving that vision. My job is to make hard choices and present them as a (hopefully) coherent and functioning game engine." That's what I want to achieve with my game and also what I want to see in the games that I buy from other people. I'd rather have a whole bunch of focused games that do X well and Y badly (or vice versa) than a single universal game that does both X and Y but only reasonably effectively.

It's a single tightly designed engine that does all the things it needs to.<br/><br/>Optional rules to me are a way of consciously making your game incomplete. Instead of presenting a single coherent mode of play, you are issuing a set of tools for people to use and expecting them to build their own.</blockquote>\nI disagree. BW's sub-systems are explicitly optional rules. The text states this clearly. "Here are some more complicated rules for doing stuff .. better not use them until you understand the game."<br/><br/>As I said above, in my current BW campaign, we use almost none of the optional rules. The game runs fine, and this approach has been endorsed by people like Luke on various fora.*<br/><br/>I say this not to be argumentative ... I honestly thought BW was a textbook example of what we were talking about it.

The game can't happen away from all participants; and it is not being played if there is any sort of out-of-fiction conversation; and there is an RPG-community-accepted (and -enforced) consistency to play from group to group. (see also <i>System Matters</i>)<br/><b>Proceduralists</b> - "Play happens whenever the system is engaged, be it to tune rules to suit a game style or to prep for play." Part of the game is the prep, the noodling with options (or power combos or feat combos or challenge ratings or...), and the meta-level conversations which adjust (or ease into) the implementation of basic rules for a particular play group. (see also <i>Lonely Fun</i>)<br/><br/>Therefore, there are probably only a few ways to resolve this thread in any meaningful way:<br/>* Do what your market and target demographic demands - some game consumers demand options for game customizing (or they'll house rule them and, if they do so poorly, will blame your game!). Exs: GLASS, HERO, GURPS, (older) D&amp;D<br/>* Do what your artistic vision requires - some game designers have a VERY specific purpose of (and therefore way to) play their games, which brooks no tweaking around the systemic edges. Exs: DitV, Grey Ranks, most "focused" story games<br/>* Do what your business plan requires - some flexible or customizable engines are better sold as discrete products, with tunable options of the core system "baked in" for quick game starts.

I hadn't thought of optional *learning* rules, to be discarded.<br/><br/>Hmmm.... but one could argue that stuff like Hit Location (or, generally, anything which has the effect of making the game "tougher" or "more detailed") is part of the core design, but not implemented until one is ready. Sure, they're not explicitly spoken of that way in the RAW, but I could see some D&amp;D Grognard saying, "All the rules in the book are the 'full rules' and turning one or more off with the Option toggle is just making the game easier to learn--it's like playing Basic D&amp;D to get the hang of the procedures before you get into Advanced D&amp;D's details and higher level abilities and such."<br/><br/>But as a linguistic approach to presenting options: I like it. I could even see suing that somewhat in GLASS, though the Options are more for mood-evoking: "Use 'Resurrect Location' Toggle until your players have the hang of the lethality of GLASS; then add a Resurrect Timer Option, to inject a sense of urgency into near-death situations; and finally have the Resurrect Location destroyed or disabled somehow, to set the game to the 'No Resurrect' Toggle."<br/><br/>Huh.

Advanced rules are rules that are more complex than I think most people will want but reflect the way that <i>I think</i> the game should be played (inverse square-law for calculating explosive damage). Optional rules are rules that produce some specific sometimes-wanted/sometimes-not effect in the game that is good for some games but not others (like rules for reloading for games where you are tracking ammo or rules for a blow-to-the-back-of-the-head knocking people out for pulp games).<br/><br/>However: any optional rule should say clearly what it is for and how/when you should go about using it. Any advanced rule should have a suitable non-advanced rule for people who don't care that much.<br/><br/>I kind of wish I could say that failure to consider both of these makes me lose respect for the game designer but, alas, it wouldn't be true <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>-Marco                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9347/optional-rules-threat-or-menace" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9347/optional-rules-threat-or-menace" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9347/optional-rules-threat-or-menace/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F9347%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F9347%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
