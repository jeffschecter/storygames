Except, instead of just talking about it, I made a committment. I have about a week left and I'm just not sure how I'm going to pull this off. Help a brother out!<br/><br/>I'm wanting three things, really: Jobs, Magic and Elements. I want them to be meaningful in the context of the game. Jobs seem to be so much more than Abilities, but just making them a Pool doesn't work. Also, I really don't like the way that the Pools are currently set up. Either sell me on Instinct Reason and Vigor or help me acquire better fits for FF.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63716/#Comment_63716" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-12T13:27:41+00:00" title="April 12, 2007  1:27PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and Summons.

I wanted something that progessed as you went along. Like Abilities, which can be raised in value. Except if you had Abilities like Swords and Diplomacy and then added in a larger defining characteristic like Dark Knight, it wouldn't work. You'd be feeling like everything you were doing was Dark Knight stuff, or you wouldn't be able to figure out what it <i>did</i> do.<br/><br/>So, what if it was a Pool? Again we run into a problem of definition. How do I refresh a Black Mage Pool? I'm willing to come up with ideas to this question, but only if Pools makes the most sense for the problem. If it was a Pool, you could have special Abilities based solely on it. But then, how would other characters 'cure' Black Mage Harm?<br/><br/>I suppose if you made a Job into a Pool and made it Elementally aligned, then there might be ways of healing Fire Harm, or Shadow Harm. Heck, you might even state that if you couldn't do what was necessary to cure the Shadow Harm that you could use other Pools but that you'd become aligned to that Element as it seeps into you.<br/><br/>But now we come back to Black Mage. Unlike other Jobs, Mage jobs cast spells all over the spectrum (Red Mages, too, even moreso). So, would their Fire Spell, which we haven't even designed yet, be Shadow aligned in the previous example? Would it be both? Would Shadow just be a default for any Ability or Secret that didn't already have an Elemental Alignment?<br/><br/>So, now, by train of thought, we have Jobs that are Elementally aligned and Abilities based on them. Would Spells be Abilities or Secrets? I would think a Secret, because FF magic rarely if ever fails.<br/><br/>Now that makes a little more sense. A Job could be a Pool that fuels Secrets, which can be defined as dealing whatever Harm you normally deal with. Excellent! But that strips out Elements, and leaves us with defining what Refreshes a Job Pool (as well as numerating a lot of Secrets).<br/><br/>Boy, these characters had better be racking up the XP to even begin to look like their CRPG counterparts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63767/#Comment_63767" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-13T04:00:00+00:00" title="April 13, 2007  4:00AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Mark, what are the interfaces of a pool?

I'll have to figure out how many Elements you can get with a purchase and what affects they have on the Pools. Because having to pay for Elements but not being able to use them until you bought Secrets would suck.<br/><br/>Hmm, or maybe each Element would be a Secret.<br/><br/>Secret: Blazing Fire<br/>You can now add the Fire Element to any or all of your Pools. A Fire Elementally Aligned Pool can now be refreshed by acts of Intense Passion (heated arguments, intense sex, extended acts of consumption or destruction). Remember, refreshes must be scenes with other characters, but do not have to have conflicts in them. You can refresh multiple Pools at once. If a Pool does not have an Element assigned to it, it will only be refreshed at the end of the current adventure/story arc/chapter.<br/><br/>If Mettle is Fire Aligned, you can spend a point from the Pool to make a Mettle Ability [Fire] aligned. A Mettle [Fire] Ability deals +1 Harm or blocks 1 Harm from an [Ice] Ability. Once the Harm has been dealt or blocked, the Ability loses its alignment.<br/><br/>. . .<br/><br/>How does that strike you (all)?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63887/#Comment_63887" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-13T23:42:28+00:00" title="April 13, 2007 11:42PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 13, 2007 11:42PM by shreyas.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Mark, I think you have access to a more elegant expression of that ability.
