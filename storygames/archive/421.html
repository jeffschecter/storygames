                    So I'm splitting this one off from <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=407&amp;page=1#Item_50" rel="nofollow"><b>"(Blue Rose) How to Design What Doesn't Matter?"</b></a>, since it isn't about Blue Rose and seems at best a tangent over design approach.  This seems to be going back to the definition of "Design What Doesn't Matter", I think, which remains unclear.  <br/><br/>Kuma compares the text of D&amp;D versus the text of Polaris.  Regarding D&amp;D, he concludes: <br/><br/><b>Kuma</b> wrote:
<blockquote>But I own a good percentage of the rest of the core, and none of it tells you <i>why</i> - it tells you <i>how</i>, and it gives you an awful lot of very good tools for making your game new or different or to shape it in a way that pleases you - but none of it tells you <i>why</i> - nor does it even ask the question.<br/><br/>Which is why D&amp;D is a sandbox - it's a great shining pool of resources - raw materials - that you can use to build a roleplaying experience - any experience you want (as long as it's fantasy, mind) to get out of it - but you have to first know what you want and how to make it.</blockquote>
This still appears contradictory to me.  Your stated limitation is that you have to know what and how, but you agreed earlier that D&amp;D does explain <i>how</i> to play.  That's the primary purpose of a game text, in my opinion -- to tell you how to play the game.  The current "core rulebooks" of D&amp;D are short on introductory text -- but particularly if you buy a starting module (like <i>Sunless Citadel</i>, say) along with the core rulebooks, it is clear how to play to play the game.  Alternately, there are separate introductory products like the Adventure Game or Basic Set.  <br/><br/>A game text can include a statement of why you would want to play this game -- but that seems more marketing than game design to me.  I don't see how it changes the nature of play.  In practice, I will follow the instructions of <i>how</i> to play the game -- and if I like it then I'll keep doing it.  My personal reasons for why I enjoy the game might or might not be the same as the author's guess as to why.  <br/><br/>I don't mean to downplay marketing or review.  Suggestions of why one would play a given game are useful in getting a handle on a game design -- they're good for marketing, for reviews, and for author's preface or design notes.  But I don't see it as part of the game design per se.  What do other people feel about this?  <br/><br/>Kuma cited the first two paragraphs of <i>Polaris</i> as a contrast to D&amp;D3.  While I don't see is how such game text changes the nature of play.  I mean, suppose I had an edition of <i>Polaris</i> where those two paragraphs were left out.  Conversely, suppose I had an edition of D&amp;D3 where someone had written in a corresponding two-paragraph note on why to play in the front.                </div>

                            I think the distinction between the two is that 3e and many other games tell you what to do when conflicts occur and so on. But the game doesn't tell you how you get the characters there. They don't tell you how to make, as Vincent calls them, 'fit characters.' They don't tell you how to create situation. A lot of the games make huge assumptions about how to get characters from point A to point B, and KotDT gets a lot of mileage from the chaos that follows.<br/>
<br/>
Some folks, I'm sure, just get it and know what to do, but not me. I could have used that stuff soooo badly when I was a teenager. Hell, I could have used it three years ago.                        </div>

                            John, I think you're overlooking the power of 'why' text, especially when coupled with rules that support that 'why' and rules that don't.<br/><br/>Good 'why' text without rules to support that will get you something like <em>Vampire: the Masquerade</em>.  Lots of people played the game with dark and brooding vampires playing politics with lives, despite the fact that the rules don't actually encourage this.  On the other hand, a lot of people ended up playing slaughterfests, too.  (Blue Rose falls into this category.)<br/><br/>Good 'why' text with rules to support that gets you <em>My Life With Master</em> or <em>Dogs</em> or even <em>Sorcerer</em>.  Nobody plays Dogs without dispensing judgement.  Nobody plays MLWM without confronting the Master.<br/><br/>No 'why' text with rules that support a 'hidden' why gets you something like GURPS, where people min-max effectiveness, avoid their disadvantages, and work to bring their advantages into play.<br/><br/>Players do take direction from game text that tells them why they would play that game.  If nothing else, it's what explains what that game is a good tool for.  If that text had no function, I might be playing epic fantasy quests with the world hanging in the balance using <em>kill puppies for satan</em>.                        </div>

                            I feel that "why text" is important, but because such texts can't overcome ambiguity and subjectivity--they'll impact different persons differently because of their respective experiences, etc.--"why text" is an unreliable medium for transmitting the experience which the designer is trying to provide.<br/><br/>Matt, for the sake of the conversation, I think you need to pretend that 3e really does tell you how to get the characters to the conflicts. (Personally, I don't know the game aside from brief glances at the rules, secondhand chatter, and extrapolation from AD&amp;D1e.)<br/><br/>A better example might be my experience of playing <i>Illuminati</i>, a sort of board/card game, with a couple of friends in college. (This was the original pocket game published by Steve Jackson Games, which I don't think has changed much, but shouldn't be confused with INWO or GURPS Illuminati or whatever.) The game is clearly functional in the sense that the rules are unambiguous, you can get a winner in a reasonable amount of time, there's good interplay between players, and so forth. However, at the end of the game, my friends expressed weak enthusiasm at best because it didn't really give the feel of skullduggery, scheming, wheels-within-wheels, and puzzle palace conspiracies. The expectations formed by the advertising and color text weren't met. The "fiction" that they were hoping to interact with through the mechanics of the game simply wasn't there.<br/><br/>What's funny is that one of these friends was later persuaded to play an abstract card game called "Dahimi" (among other names), in which your relative position in each round of play is determined by your performance in the previous round. The high-ranking players get to take good cards from the low-ranking players before the round starts, and the highest-ranking player opens the round, which is itself an advantage. The game is played ad infinitum, with no money or points changing hands, until the participants get tired; there's no particular "win-lose" or other significance attached to the final positions. The rules of the game are brief, but the strategy within each round is reasonably deep, rewarding calculation, luck, and skill. As part of the lingo of the game, the top players are called by terms of greater and lesser royalty, middling players are "bourgeois", and the bottom players are peasants. Over years of playing the game, informal house rules have been added: the top player gets to decide where to sit after each round and has control over the music; the peasants have to share the job of shuffling and dealing; peasants might also be responsible for fetching popcorn from the bar or whatever.<br/><br/>The friend in question loves Dahimi. Why? Because the mechanics are engaging and the overall structure that's developed around it strongly supports a comical fiction of social climbing in a world where the nobility is always scheming for the top spot, the bourgeois is making the best of its lot, and the peasant gets it in the neck--unless he's very fortunate and very clever.<br/><br/>The issue here is that some people approach their games the way my friend did <i>Illuminati</i>. They're attracted to certain elements of the notional subject matter, and if those elements aren't represented by the structures found in the rules, they're disappointed. Other people approach games the way my friends and I did Dahimi. They take the structure of the game and, perhaps prompted by certain cues, they relate it to an appropriate fiction. (Of course some people don't bother much with a fiction at all.) But with RPGs, the subject matter or point of attraction may be so strong for some people that the rules structure plays a relatively small role in shaping their overall experience, and in fact, if too much of the experience is encoded in formal, mechanical rules, it may weaken their experience by depriving them of their right to subjective interpretation and individual contribution to the fiction.                        </div>

Question: does MLWM have any "why" text to that effect?  Do you recall what it is?  I don't have my book handy -- I'll check it this evening, but I think it's an interesting question.  <br/><br/>In my opinion, the difference between Dogs and MLWM and GURPS is not at all in the "why" text.  The difference is in the "how" text.  You are given instructions on how to create a Master and how to structure play.  You are told how to arrange scenes.  This is the how text that makes it a good game design.  <br/><br/>As for D&amp;D, it's true that there isn't a lot of text on how to get the PCs to the dungeon.  On the other hand, I think the same thing is true of, say, Dogs in the Vineyard.  There's no defined procedure about how to get the players to the next town.  There is a list of options for direction between towns: (1) the next town, (2) Back to the temple, (3) Back to a previous town; or (4) Home or elsewhere, abandoning their service.  However, there is no suggested way of dealing with <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a>.  <br/><br/>It's true that this is a hole of sorts in the rules for both cases, but it's not hard to extrapolate a means to with it by agreement between the players.                        </div>

I'll agree that, historically, the place of a game text has been to explain how to play the game - I don't think you could ahe a game text that doesn't explain <i>how</i> to play the game.  But what texts like <i>Polaris</i> and <i>PTA</i> do is explain the designer's expectaions for <i>why</i> you're playing their game, as opposed to some other game, and what to expect from the rules to their game.  <br/><br/>The very first paragraph in <i>PTA</i> is: "Primetime Adventures is a game where the participants create and play out a weekly television show.  In this book are rules for creating a show and its cast and sets, and for playing out adventures as if they were the show's episodes."<br/><br/>It doesn't get any clearer than that.  Try and emulate <i>Lord of the Rings</i> with <i>PTA</i>, and you might have some problems.<br/><br/>But the text for D&amp;D is <i>maddeningly zen</i> on the topic of why.  I thought maybe I'd screwed up last night by posting direct references to the texts - it was 1am and I'd just come back from <i>V for Vendetta</i> (great movie!  go see it!) so my blood was pumping and I got the books off the shelf.  This morning, I thought maybe the <i>why</i> of D&amp;D was in the PHB instead - so I checked.  The first paragraph of the PHB after the short walkthrough on character creation?  <br/><br/>"When you play [D&amp;D], you create a unique fictional character that lives in your imagination and the imaginations of your friends.  One person in the game, the Dungeon Master (DM), controls the monsters and people that live in the fantasy world.  You and your friends face the dangers and explore the mysteries that your [DM] sets before you." (p. 6)<br/><br/>That's a definition for roleplaying games <i>in general</i> - at least non-authority sharing ones, mind.  I think it's interesting - it's like the movie <i>Cube</i> - as though the game has always existed and perpetuates its own existence simply by being.  It's bizarre.
<blockquote>A game text can include a statement of why you would want to play this game -- but that seems more marketing than game design to me. I don't see how it changes the nature of play. In practice, I will follow the instructions of how to play the game -- and if I like it then I'll keep doing it. My personal reasons for why I enjoy the game might or might not be the same as the author's guess as to why.</blockquote>
Whether the text is implicit or not really isn't the point - <i>PTA</i> could not tell us what it was designed for and we could still figure it out - but that's what I'm getting at, I think: the <i>how</i> in PTA gives you a really firm, clear picture of <i>why</i> - as does Polaris.  But does a player reading the PHB know at the end of the book <i>why</i> he's playing D&amp;D, other than the fact that it's "the game that has defined the fantastic imagination for over a quarter century"?<br/><br/>And we also have to separate out <i>how</i> and tease it apart.  Mr. Wilson said this up-thread - that there's no instruction on putting the elements of D&amp;D together - and there isn't.  So there's the <i>how</i> of handling the elements of the game once they interact with one another - what I'd call <i>procedural how</i>; but there's no situational or <i>conceptual how</i> - no instruction set on bringing together the elements in the first place.  Once your fighter has found the umber hulk, D&amp;D's rules are painfully explicit.  But the <i>how</i> of getting the fighter to the umber hulk - the <i>why</i> of the thing - is absolutely MIA.  By reading the game text, the general gist of it would seem to be "Your DM created an adventure that features an umber hulk, and you have a fighter and when umber hulks meet fighters, bad things happen."  <br/><br/>To bring in yet another idea - D&amp;D's text, as written, has no push <i>and</i> no pull - the players must supply either one.  Advancement isn't a <i>pull</i> - it's the end-result of the encounter process.  D&amp;D's game text is neutrally bouyant, like a mylar balloon.                        </div>

<blockquote>As for D&amp;D, it's true that there isn't a lot of text on how to get the PCs to the dungeon. On the other hand, I think the same thing is true of, say, Dogs in the Vineyard. There's no defined procedure about how to get the players to the next town. There is a list of options for direction between towns: (1) the next town, (2) Back to the temple, (3) Back to a previous town; or (4) Home or elsewhere, abandoning their service. However, there is no suggested way of dealing with <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a>.</blockquote>
<i>Dogs</i> is incredibly explicit: One session, one town.  If any other odd situation arises, then it's generated by the players and I'd assume that the players have an idea of how they'd like to deal with it.

It's like you're treating RPGs as some sort of magic book that makes people do what the designer intended without the players every buying in beyond following instructions.

Obviously I'm not saying that player intent has no impact on actual play.  I'm saying that internal player intent is beyond the scope of game design per se.  <br/><br/>As I ponder the difference, it's interesting.  I'd seriously like for you to consider my question at the beginning.  If I leave out the first two paragraphs of Polaris, do you consider it fundamentally changed as a game design?  Would changing the introductory text for Vampire: The Masquerade change the game?  I wouldn't think so, but it's interesting to me to hear other views.  <br/><br/>While such text might draw players in, I don't think that in the long run it has much effect.  I think that players will find their own motivations over time for playing based on the actual how of the game.  Getting down to this, I can compare the PTA text and the D&amp;D text quoted earlier: 
<blockquote>"Primetime Adventures is a game where the participants create and play out a weekly television show. In this book are rules for creating a show and its cast and sets, and for playing out adventures as if they were the show's episodes."</blockquote>
<blockquote>"When you play [D&amp;D], you create a unique fictional character that lives in your imagination and the imaginations of your friends. One person in the game, the Dungeon Master (DM), controls the monsters and people that live in the fantasy world. You and your friends face the dangers and explore the mysteries that your [DM] sets before you."</blockquote>
I don't see a significant distinction here.  So PTA text says that I'll be emulating a television show, but it doesn't say why I would want to do so.  Similarly, D&amp;D says that I'll be playing out a game with that structure, but it doesn't say why I'd want to do so.  What's the difference?  Both of these are saying what the game is, but not why a real person would play.<br/><br/>Is Primetime Adventures just emulating television to emulate television?  I don't think so, but the larger motivation for doing so is beyond the scope of the game design.                        </div>

<code>Obviously I'm not saying that player intent has no impact on actual play.

I believe actual play based off of that book would be profoundly impacted, creating many different games with less to do with each other than games benefiting of an introduction in the text.<br/><br/>If the introduction would not make any difference, it shouldn't be there.  If the introduction didn't make any difference, it wouldn't be an introduction in the first place.  The introduction of any written work sets up expectations in the reader's consciousness that are then fulfilled or denied (or both).  It's pretty fundamental to the way reading works.  I profoundly don't understand your position, here.                        </div>

<br/>
Get rid of all the muddiness about D&amp;D and it's clear as day: introductory text can influence player intent but it can't determine it. It works better for some people than it does for others.<br/>
<br/>
The argument in favor of DWDM is that introductory text is so limited in its power over player intent that hardcoding your rules for a specific intent actually increases the chance that players will be unable to play the game they think is represented by the introductory text. Whereas if both the text and the rules are suggestive but not determinative, players will be able to fit the mechanical tools to their textual understanding.                        </div>

                            Yep, that's the one I'm talking about, Josh. This is something that's never going to be resolved until everyone sees things my way <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> and agrees that it's a big "both".<br/><br/>What's more controversial about my position, though, is that I see some people who believe in strongly aligning the mechanics and the introductory text. But what they don't realize is that their belief in the superiority of this method is founded on:<br/><br/>a) A belief that the introductory text can be pinned down precisely, so that mechanics <i>can</i> express it perfectly (well, adequately). Result: highly structured games. Risk: missing the point for a portion of your audience. They know how to play the game, they just don't see why they should care.<br/><br/>b) Or, a belief that the introductory text can be pinned down precisely, so that it can adequately fill in the blanks regarding motivation and procedure. Result: vaguely structured games. Risk: thrashing and confusion by a portion of your audience. What they get from the introductory text isn't enough, after all, to tell them how to play the game.<br/><br/>I think I had a (c) and maybe a (d) going into this post, but I don't remember what they were. Maybe a mirror image showing the risks &amp; rewards of seeing introductory text as fluff. But (b) is a really meaty issue because it's where I see comments about certain games only working <i>procedurally</i> if you approach them with a particular mindset. It's easy to say that a given game is boring because its mechanics don't really depict the fiction in a way that interests you. It's quite a different thing to say that you can't even play a given game because you can't grasp what it is you're supposed to be doing.<br/><br/>I seem to recall that Brand had a blog post along these lines.                        </div>

                            Just to be clear, I do think that introductory text such as the first two paragraphs of Polaris have some effect on actual play.  <br/>
<br/>
However, many other things also have an effect on how you read the rules and indirectly on how you play.  For example, the illustrations of a game text will have an effect.  The fiction snippets, sample characters, and sample adventure will have an effect.  The advertising you read about the game before you get it will have an effect.  The reputation of the publisher may have an effect.  <br/>
<br/>
However, I conceptually make a distinction between the game design and things surrounding it.  It's a fuzzy distinction, but I prefer drawing over conceptual areas than over the physical boundaries of the book, because games vary considerably in what is included in the core book.  For example, one RPG might have a separate supplement for adapting it to other settings and genres -- while another RPG might include that in the same volume as the core rules.  Anyhow, many of these fall in the fuzzy area.  I tend to rate game examples and sample material as being a more central part of design than illustrations and fiction.  As for things like the introduction or the designer's notes, I'm not sure.  <br/>
<br/>
At least, I don't consider a game incomplete if it doesn't have this.  I'm fine with a game that just tells you how to play, and just lets you find for yourself what you like about it.                        </div>

                            Hey, Josh, just to be clear, in case you're addressing my post, I'm not saying one option is better than the other. I think I've been saying that in designing games, playing them, and critiquing them, the effect of non-mechanical elements like intro text, hype, and even (especially) what the players bring to the table affects how the games are received by different people.<br/>
<br/>
What I'm really trying to emphasize is that it's not just that different people see different things when it comes to "why" text. (Which as John says, might not even be in the book.) It's that the relative importance of "why" text vs. rules varies from person to person. That's why you can take a simple set of rules which just regulate physical properties of the game world, slap on some color text, and have some readers believe that you've really captured the essence of the subject material, or at least given them the tools they need to do so in their actual play. Meanwhile other readers are going to read the book and see your color text as just so much cheerleading that tells you that "You can do it!" while presenting a limp, formless set of isolated mechanics.                        </div>

                            Someone on RPG.net once did a post about this that gets towards a disconnect that happens in games like Eliot is talking about. Because RPG.net doesn't have a search and my Google Fu can't dig it out, I'll try to recreate it. <br/><br/>The thread was about things you hate in an RPG, and the poster's comment was "fluff text that doesn't match the rules" and the example went like this: <br/><br/>"Mary Sue stood next to the barn door breathing heavily, her mind out of control with fear. She hissed towards Marvin Sue under her breath, "Come with me, the dark one is coming closer, he's within 100 feet now and unless we go we will surely die, I can feel his intent to kill you!" So saying she grabbed Marvin and pulled him towards the back door, feeling the evil come closer at every moment. <br/><br/>"Sense Evil: Using this power the psychic can sense evil in the area. This power cannot be used while the wielder is emotionally distraught, nor can it be used while moving. It gives a sense that evil is in the area, but no specific information about distance, direction, or the intent of the evil being." <br/><br/>Faced with something like that, I can see where lots of folks get their idea of the game disjoined from the things said in the text. The question is: is this a natural thing, or something done in response to crap like that above being the standard?<br/><br/>(Ditto to people being pissed off with the game's mechanics and lots of "system gets in the way" talk -- they read the fiction and DO think they should be able to do that. Have it happen enough times that you can't and eventually you'll get to despise mechanics too.)                        </div>

                            Yes, Elliot, but DWM/DWDM (which I'm not even sure if we're talking about at this point) is a design philosophy, and has zero to do with how actual players use a game and everything to do with how a designer expects players to use the game they're about to write.  Which means, yes, labeling any game either way is indulging in authorial intent, but I like to think it's still a worthwhile observation.  In any case, countering "But to Gamer X, Game Y is DWM, not DWDM" is like saying "But George sat on the table, so that makes it a chair."                        </div>

<blockquote>I don't see a significant distinction here. So PTA text says that I'll be emulating a television show, but it doesn't say why I would want to do so.

Both of these are saying what the game is, but not why a real person would play.</blockquote>
The <i>PTA</i> text doesn't tell you why, but it gives you a perfect picture of what it is you're going to be doing in the game.  If emulating a TV show isn't your cup of tea, then you can answer why all by yourself - because that sounds like a really boring way to be spending your time.<br/><br/>The D&amp;D text doesn't give you any kind of picture about what you're going to be doing in the game, because it leaves it entirely in the hands of the DM, per the text.  Now where the rubber meets the road - yes, you're going to have a DM explaining to you what you're going to be doing in the campaign/game - but leaving that entirely in the hands of the DM can be risky.  I've played with some seriously shitty DMs (I should add that I've also played with some really shitty Storytellers, GMs and so on ... but I digress).<br/><br/>What the intro text says to me, along with the complete lack of guidance, is that there's <b>no design philosophy whatsoever</b> to D&amp;D 3rd Ed, other than to provide a delivery vehicle for an existing brand name to an existing fanbase.  And the remainder of the core does nothing but back that up - give existing players Stuff to keep them interested, and hope that they'll do your recruiting for you.                        </div>

Well, at least we seem to have agreed that answering <i>why</i> isn't important for the game text - that it's the <i>what</i> and <i>how</i> that are there.

I have part of a wordier response stored somewhere but I think we're beginning to go in circles. Or maybe wordy isn't the way to go. Here's how I see it: if you aren't concerned with the impact of the game text on how other people are going to use the game, then you're desiging the game for your own use, and that's it. Otherwise, if you don't account for the limitations of natural language, variability in the audience's experiences, and everything else that makes communication problematic, you may be setting yourself up for some pitfalls.<br/><br/>Avoid natural language altogether and you run the risk of creating an abstract game that doesn't "mean" anything. ("Sure, in 'Disco Era', the player gets a number called "malaise", but it's really just a bit of color draped over what appears to be an uninspired Chinese Checkers variant. And what does "malaise" have to do with "inflation", anyway?) Use natural langage for the "why" and you risk lying to your audience. ("This game doesn't have anything to do with the fundamental themes of <i>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</i>! It's really just a rehash of <i>Mike Mulligan and his Steam Shovel</i>.") Use natural language for the "how to play" and you risk losing your audience altogether. ("But what do you do?" "You have epic adventures." "But there's nothing in the rules that tells you how to do that.")<br/><br/>(Still kinda long but believe me the other one was longer.)                        </div>

Anyone can write and publish a game. Read Hybrid lately? <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>But if you're publishing for others, you must necessarily take into account player variability and provide multiple options and methods for your game.

It's the <em>how else</em>.<br/><br/>You need both.<br/><br/>For my own game (the Dead of Night RPG) DWM created Survival Points (basic rules) and the Tension mechanic (advanced option). Everything else is DWDM -- even the system for Attributes and Specialisations. In a versatile horror game, you absolutely need a mechanism for writing characters out of the story -- Survival Points. Horror often involves varying degrees of fear and grim description, with events occasionally out of the characters' control -- Tension. Tension is important to Dead of Night in the same way that Sanity is important to Cthulhu. It's necessary to play the game I wrote, but it's not necessary to play a horror game. Players can change everything else in the game without changing the game itself. 
<p>I think it's helpful, but not necessary, to include the <em>why</em> in game text. If you explain the <em>how</em> well enough, the <em>why</em> will be obvious to most players, or the players will create their own <em>why</em> after experiencing the <em>how</em>. As I think about it, <em>why</em> seems completely geared towards marketing text. It might attract people to the game, but only an effective <em>how</em> will keep them playing.</p> </div>

<blockquote>only an effective <i>how</i> will keep them playing.</blockquote>
You'd think so, but the funny thing about RPGs is that if you make it too clear how and why to play them, they start to look like board games.<br/><br/>While <i>why</i> is geared towards marketing, for some games and some groups, it can supply the motivation that encourages the construction of an effective <i>how</i> out of the social interactions of the players, so that gaps in the mechanics can be bridged.<br/><br/>Take <i>Diplomacy</i> for example: there are no rules that tell you how to negotiate or make agreements. But there are clear mechanical procedures for what happens on the map, a clear criterion for determining a single-player winner, and a socially-ingrained conception of "winning" which guides play. "Winning" is the fictional "why" that, along with the state of the game board, informs the actual-play "how" of negotiation.<br/><br/>RPGs usually can't rely on such a widely-understood fiction as winning/losing. Yet they manage to be functional when the motivations of the players are sufficiently in-synch--even to the point of supporting freeform play with no overt rules. So if you're writing the game, you <i>can</i> depend on "why" text to some extent, and you probably have to if you aren't writing a game that falls back on "win/lose" to motivate and interest the players.                        </div>

                            Hmm. <br/>
<br/>
I make a distinction between writing different sorts of how. <br/>
<br/>
How you must: <br/>
Usually a no-no for a flexible game. These are playing-dictating. Tic-tac-toe is strictly a how-you-must game. <br/>
<br/>
How you ought: <br/>
These are player-limiting. Change or go away. Nearly all games have some bits of this. <br/>
<br/>
How you can: <br/>
These are player enabling. When the player decides they are interested and ready to try something, the options are available. <br/>
<br/>
For RPGs, I prefer to eliminate the must, minimize the ought, and include the can.                        </div>

It conveys what RPG play is like - not what D&amp;D play is like.  Plus, I think that if you take the text on face value, you completely lose the richness that you can get from the system.  Not only that, but it mentions fantasy is a very off-hand way, despite being a very fantasy-is-as-fantasy-does kind of game.
<blockquote>Are there other games that we could compare thoughts on? Games like Toon, Paranoia, Champions, or Feng Shui?</blockquote>
So I just wandered over to my game shelf (one of them, anyways) and pulled out a handful of titles with my eyes closed:
<blockquote><i>Mutants &amp; Masterminds</i> (1st Ed): "In the [M&amp;M RPG], you take opn the role of a costumed superhero safeguarding the world from threats ranging from marauding super-criminals to alien invasions, hulking monsters, natural disasters and would-be conquerors."</blockquote>
Note that even though its d20(ish), the text is much more descriptive than D&amp;D.
<blockquote><i>Amber</i>: <i>"What would another generation have been like?"<br/><br/>"How can such questions be answered?  I have no idea."<br/><br/>- The Hand of Oberon</i><br/><br/>that's where you come in, the players and game masters of <i>Amber</i>.  If there's one thing that we all have in common, all who would use this book, it's trying to answer that question, "what would another generation have been like?"<br/><br/>For players, this means becoming part of that new generation, playing a character whose parents are as powerful as gods, a character who is inheriting those powers in full measure.  For Game Masters, it is the challenge of unfolding the grandest of all settings.<br/><br/>The next generation of <i>Amber</i>.</blockquote>
Amber assumes that you're familiar with (and a fan of) the books.
<blockquote><i>Godlike</i>: <i>Godlike</i> is the result of a question I've been asking myself since I read my first comic book.  The question is this:<br/><br/>"What would a world with super-humans <i>really</i> be like?"<br/><br/>[continues ...]</blockquote>
And just for shits and grins - <i>Fantasy Wargaming, circa 1981:</i>
<blockquote>In <i>Fantasy Wargaming</i> you enter into a realm where magic really does work, where ancient revelations unfold and provide a gatewawy to the Supernatural.  as you devise your own adventures in this highest level for fantasy players, your cunningly logical maneuvers enable you to overwhlem dangerous opponents and formidable obstacles.</blockquote>
I have to note that this is <i>after</i> a three-page screed on how wonderfully logical, correct and authentic the game is, and how D&amp;D is for wussies.  It's hi-larious - I may have to scan it so I can post it.                        </div>

Wait, I think we're talking about different things.  So it seems that you're talking about just the wording of a few sentences in the introduction of "what this game is about", right?  I was saying that the D&amp;D core books as a whole convey what play is like.  It certainly conveys focus on fantasy.  There are extended examples of play, illustrations, instructions, and so forth.  <br/><br/>I think the introductory text is largely a marketing decision.  D&amp;D is the market leader.  It isn't trying to sell itself over other RPGs -- it's trying to distinguish itself from other forms of games.  Hence it's introduction focuses on what is different about role-playing.  Conversely, small games want to distinguish themselves as much as possible from other RPGs in general and D&amp;D in particular.  <br/><br/>For example, <i>My Life With Master</i> is selling itself to people who already play RPGs.  It's introduction reads: 
<blockquote>Dear Reader take warning...go not incautiously forward into these pages, for they describe a roleplaying game about the horrific and dysfunctional ties that bind a monstrous Master and his or her minions.  It is a game with a not-so-traditional style of play that could well give you the creeps...though other games may have not. <br/><br/>Now having weighed this caution, should you proceed with these rules I think you'll find the most chilling events of your games aren't so much inflicted by the GM upon the players, but rather, produced by <i>them</i> to the horror of all.  <br/><br/>Will you laugh? ... If you like that sort of thing.</blockquote>
Note that it assumes you know what the traditional style of role-playing is, and uses the terms "GM" and "players" without having defined them.  (It never does.)  It does identify a particular theme for the game, but that rides on its starting assumption that the reader already knows about role-playing and how it works.                        </div>

Excellent breakdown. So here's the thing: you're playing an old-fashioned dungeoncrawl, when suddenly the guy playing the fighter decides his character freaks out and wants to gut the wizard, who's out of combat spells.<br/><br/>Must: "PCs cannot directly damage other PCs," hard-coded into the mechanics of the rules. You can't hit other PC's, can't shoot them, push them off cliffs, etc.<br/><br/>Can: "Any actions are allowed which are not explicitly forbidden by the rules." The player says, "My guy is paranoid and thinks the other guys are going to cheat him out of his share of treasure. Hasn't anyone seen <i>Treasure of the Sierra Madre</i>?"<br/><br/>Ought: "Characters are friends and allies who should work together to overcome the challenges of the dungeon. Combat should be discouraged as a way to solve interparty conflicts." Fuzzy, but reasonably functional. Still, just how far are you obliged to help others? If you can only increase the chance of <i>everyone</i> making it out alive by decreasing your chance, what do you do? What if someone else calls you a selfish jerk and vows not to help you next time?                        </div>
