I recently caught a dose of the fabled spare time I've heard so much about and I was challenged by my RPG playing group last we met to make and run a rules lite Story gamey approach to Pendragon by this Saturday. My initial brainstorming was done where all good ideas come from (the shower) and I decided to collect my thoughts into the 3 question (+1) structure that John Wick uses as well as a side list of stuff I like to see in games in general.<br/><br/><b>1. What is your game about?:</b> The game is about the universal themes of Arthurian Literature, The Once and Future King in particular being my model work. The relationship of force &amp; justice, the role of conflict in a society, and the esteem that comes with a title etc. The themes are to be treated in such away that while they are perfect for knights of Dark Ages England they also fit with paladins of medieval fantasy or White Hat Hackers of the cyberpunk near future. Balance of fraternity, duty, and your own moral compass becomes the defining conflict but at the same time including high adventure moments.<br/><br/><b>2. How Does your game do that?:</b> By focusing on the reasons why we do things and what we do over how or if we can do them. The mechanics are entirely theoretical at this point but the focus will be on emotion desire, personal morals, and the pressure of the group more so than whither or not your sword can crack the armor or line of code crack the system. You don't pierce the armor because you were strong, you did it out of Loyalty to the king that gave the order. You didn't hack the system because you were smart enough, but more because of your Love for the person the Corporate bastards took from you. <br/><br/><b>3. What behaviors does your game reward?:</b> Compromise among the group as well as sticking to your guns and assuring you avoid compromising your code of ethics even in the face of a situation that paints it in a negative light. The latter is still up for debate in my mind as the archetypical Chaotic Good character still has a moral code it is just not as written while genocidal crusaders would stick to one without question to negative results.<br/><br/><b>4. Why is that fun?</b> Being on adventures that raise moral questions and are about people more than about their equipment has been the main reason I've enjoyed the story games movement. I want the same epic feel we get from games like Pendragon but without all the mechanical fuss bogging down the parts that made the game shine, I also want it to be transferable to other settings of similar style but with different trappings.<br/><br/><b>Stuff I'd like but do not need.:</b> <br/>1. Preferably GMless as I like games that require the entire group to forge a story without prep as they always come out as a surprise to everyone.<br/>2. Stats reflective of personality traits, vices, and virtues with skill and gear being modifiers.<br/>3. A system of lineage similar to Pendragon that contains narrative weight.<br/>4.A "knights of the round table" motif consistent throughout whatever comes out of this just for rule of cool.<br/><br/>My only question to you is how would you do this? 0_0 As one who has never designed a game before I feel I've dove a bit to deep for a first outing as you could tell by my initial sketch being a little unfocused on what I really want out of it. I'd like to hear from some people on the subject and if it works out maybe I can make something tangible out of this mess.....even if it is just Pendragon "Pretentious Rules-lite Edition" (now with hipster mechanics!)                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433334/#Comment_433334" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-03T18:17:25+00:00" title="June  3, 2014  6:17PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the pitch!<br/><br/>"How would you do this", is, of course, a pretty, um, big question.

This is more or less going to be an ongoing experiment seeing what works and what doesn't till I can craft a game of my own, but a prototype by saturday is what I'm trying to concoct now. Not something final but a sorta of display of concept.<br/><br/>I can be an idea person but when it comes to practical matters like mechanics I'm afraid I get lost. <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_D_L" title="Paul_D_L"><img alt="Paul_D_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_D_L">Paul_D_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433340/#Comment_433340" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-03T20:35:32+00:00" title="June  3, 2014  8:35PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Writing a specific Fiasco playset comes to mind, but it seems like you're much more interested in having the personal struggle of your own character mechanized more.

It reminds me of Kingdom by Ben Robbins, the idea of conflicting visions for the future of an organization. The card mechanic seems rather interesting as well, I was thinking something along the lines of Dvorak where each session would start with each player making a set of cards representing vague events and challenges confronted by the group that would all play out one way or another by the end of the adventure as I did something similar in my attempt at a solo/GMless had of the Apocalypse World system using MC moves as the cards.<br/><br/>One thing I am interested in taking from Smallville is the use of motivations as attributes instead of your typical ones and of course you'd get bonuses on an action for having traits or aspects that match the circumstance.<br/><br/>Conflicting visions also conjured up images of Mordred or Anakin Skywalker, someone who deviates from the group so much they turn into the polar opposite of what the order was set out to be. Thus a way PVP could be injected in a more confrontational sense.<br/><br/>I really like where this could go! I'm hoping this ends up having some potential after all.\n<blockquote>I'll pull out my Pendragon and get back to you but here's an idea to mull over:<br/><br/>I was thinking about Lineage and how to incorporate it easily and usefully.

At the start the players could do some setup of themselves and immediate family and then develop the tree as the story progresses. Gives me an idea for another game in which you play a bloodline rather than an individual. I wonder if that's been done before.<br/><br/>Thanks for all the help thus far everyone. Can't believe I got so much in but a few hours. The creativity here never ceases to amaze me.

So the game starts, everyone makes a bond and fear card as well as aforementioned event cards, the fears and bonds are passed out randomly and the bond applied to the player on your left. I have for a random uncreative example Bond "______'s family are rivals with mine" and fear " I fear...Inter-family quarrels will drive the kingdom apart". You would be reward some kind of points for each scene where these add fuel to the raging fire of the problem at hand whatever that in tales thus encouraging you to make even more intrusive Bonds and Fears. While the randomization is optional I am in favor of having other players write your cards to add a little unforeseen drama to your character. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_D_L" title="Paul_D_L"><img alt="Paul_D_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_D_L">Paul_D_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433349/#Comment_433349" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-03T22:29:23+00:00" title="June  3, 2014 10:29PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That works.

Maybe the abilities and determination of action shouldn't come from traits but from a trinity (or whatever a 4 parts of that is) of sorts: Loyalty to the Order, Loyalty to your Peers, Loyalty to the People, and Loyalty to Yourself. It gives you an idea of which of the 4 values you are more likely to act in favor of. If you are in a battle depending on who you are fighting for you get certain modifiers or rather if for example if someone slaps you around and disrespects you maybe you'd turn the other cheek because of your low self value but if someone is roughing up a peasant you spring into action because you value the safety of your people beyond that of yourself.

This may not be what you're after but there may be some ideas in here to use. It certainly fits some of the criteria you initially posted about, especially portability to other genres and malleability of rules. Anyway, here's a little taste of a Setting for PNP.<br/><br/>Plug N Play: Pen and Dragon<br/><br/>We each play a  Young Knight in the Age of Chivalry just after Arthur is made King.<br/><br/>What's It All About?<br/>   Knights strive to bring Glory to their name and their lineage (both <i>once and future</i> - Ha! See what I did there?).<br/>   No Knight wishes to be remembered for their misdeeds. Therefore the accomplishment of great deeds by way of Virtue is the path to Glory. The ultimate test of Knight-hood will be the Grail Quest where only a Knight of complete Virtue will succeed. This is some years off, however and there is  plenty of time to adventure and falter and redeem yourself. Even Lancelot gave in to Lust, and Wrath was ever his weakness...<br/><br/>Cynric Names: Aeron, Aeddon, Blaen, Bradwen, etc.<br/>Saxon Names: Aelfric, Bassa, Cerdic, etc<br/>Malorian Names: Alein, Bandelaine, Berel, Briant, etc<br/><br/> Role:  Your Role is defined by your lineage. Your family (past and present) encompasses titles, patents and Heraldry. It is your first identity before making a name for yourself.<br/>  For game purposes, lineage determines what Traits you may start with and one Trait that is lacking. This missing Trait assumes that the Vice is common, the Virtue is lacking. The descendents of Oswulf, for example, lack Humility; therefor Pride is common amongst them.<br/><br/>Lineages:<br/><br/>Aeron of Cymro........Colour: Red.......Heraldry:Cambenet   <br/>Proud and boastful warriors. Less courteous  than some, but loyal and brave to a fault.<br/><br/>Oswulf the Saxon......Colour: Green ...Heraldry: Pallets    <br/>Land rich but gold poor, the Oswulf line has many  holdings and kin is never far away if you need aid or shelter.<br/> <br/>Pedivere du Mont......Colour: Gold......Heraldry: A Fess<br/>With many ties to the  Court, this line is well known for its wealth, power and political intrigues.<br/><br/>Traits: All knightly Traits are summed up by the Seven Virtues and corresponding Seven Vices.<br/><br/>Chastity       /    Lust<br/>Temperance/    Gluttony<br/>Charity        /   Greed<br/>Diligence     /    Sloth<br/>Patience      /    Wrath<br/>Kindness     /    Envy<br/>Humility      /   Pride<br/><br/>The goal of a Knight should be to eventually gain all Seven Virtues. Young knights begin with only<br/>four. As noted, each line has one Virtue missing by default and thus can never start with it. The six others are available to choose from.<br/><br/>Optional Bond Rule: Your word is your Bond. Your Bond is represented by a token. You may ask another Actor to Support you in a Dilemma.

This may not be what you're after but there may be some ideas in here to use. It certainly fits some of the criteria you initially posted about, especially portability to other genres and malleability of rules. Anyway, here's a little taste of a Setting for PNP.<br/><br/>Plug N Play: Pen and Dragon<br/><br/>We each play a  Young Knight in the Age of Chivalry just after Arthur is made King.<br/><br/>What's It All About?<br/>   Knights strive to bring Glory to their name and their lineage (both <i>once and future</i> - Ha! See what I did there?).<br/>   No Knight wishes to be remembered for their misdeeds. Therefore the accomplishment of great deeds by way of Virtue is the path to Glory. The ultimate test of Knight-hood will be the Grail Quest where only a Knight of complete Virtue will succeed. This is some years off, however and there is  plenty of time to adventure and falter and redeem yourself. Even Lancelot gave in to Lust, and Wrath was ever his weakness...<br/><br/>Cynric Names: Aeron, Aeddon, Blaen, Bradwen, etc.<br/>Saxon Names: Aelfric, Bassa, Cerdic, etc<br/>Malorian Names: Alein, Bandelaine, Berel, Briant, etc<br/><br/> Role:  Your Role is defined by your lineage. Your family (past and present) encompasses titles, patents and Heraldry. It is your first identity before making a name for yourself.<br/>  For game purposes, lineage determines what Traits you may start with and one Trait that is lacking. This missing Trait assumes that the Vice is common, the Virtue is lacking. The descendents of Oswulf, for example, lack Humility; therefor Pride is common amongst them.<br/><br/>Lineages:<br/><br/>Aeron of Cymro........Colour: Red.......Heraldry:Cambenet   <br/>Proud and boastful warriors. Less courteous  than some, but loyal and brave to a fault.<br/><br/>Oswulf the Saxon......Colour: Green ...Heraldry: Pallets    <br/>Land rich but gold poor, the Oswulf line has many  holdings and kin is never far away if you need aid or shelter.<br/> <br/>Pedivere du Mont......Colour: Gold......Heraldry: A Fess<br/>With many ties to the  Court, this line is well known for its wealth, power and political intrigues.<br/><br/>Traits: All knightly Traits are summed up by the Seven Virtues and corresponding Seven Vices.<br/><br/>Chastity       /    Lust<br/>Temperance/    Gluttony<br/>Charity        /   Greed<br/>Diligence     /    Sloth<br/>Patience      /    Wrath<br/>Kindness     /    Envy<br/>Humility      /   Pride<br/><br/>The goal of a Knight should be to eventually gain all Seven Virtues. Young knights begin with only<br/>four. As noted, each line has one Virtue missing by default and thus can never start with it. The six others are available to choose from.<br/><br/>Optional Bond Rule: Your word is your Bond. Your Bond is represented by a token. You may ask another Actor to Support you in a Dilemma. If they accept, they take your Bond and hold on to it. They can there-after compel you to Support them in any  Dilemma they face (whether they are the Lead or just Supporting) by returning your Bond to you. You can't refuse. There may be some fictional reason that your character can't be Compelled to a scene (too far away, for example) but if any way can be reasonably imagined that your character could make it, then that is what happens.<br/></blockquote>\nWow, this is actually pretty cool!

Your post got me thinking about it again because it is easily multi-genre. So I started on Pen and Dragon. The original Settings I had in mind were Dungeon Crawl, Drawing Room Mystery and Survival Horror (especially Zombie Apocalypse).  I don't want to tout PnP here but I think it hits on many of the things you are going for and I wanted to say <i>why</i> so that you can consider them in your own design. <br/><br/>  First off, I have the Pendragon box-set beside me as I type this. Wonderful source book, lousy game. It is Arthurian Legend <span style="text-decoration: underline;">on top of</span> a variation of Chaosium's BRP. Arthurian Legend isn't about how strong you are, or how fast, or how many hit points you have. It's about larger than life characters with recognizable flaws. It is the Greek legends of Gods brought down to human scale. It is, to my mind, best summed up by Arthur, in his Wrath, striking Lancelot with Excalibur. The Irresistible Force striking the Immovable Object. Arthur "breaks that which cannot be broken" striking down the paragon knight, who suffers a "wound that would not heal". The infinities cancel out. Try porting that to a game of numbers. <br/><br/>It's a game of myth where <i>how</i> you do things is secondary to <i>why</i>. So, in PnP, "how" is the narration; anything that fits is good to go. Why is based on dice rolls, available Descriptors, the viability of lending Support, who holds your Bond, what is there to gain and what is there to lose; and, most importantly, what would your character do.<br/>Consider the Support mechanism. What if the Dilemma roll is 10, or 11 or even 12! Who will willingly join you in this scene? They can help a little but they have as much to lose as you do. Where is their courage and loyalty now? Some knights, I bet, will say: "No, Sir Loin is answering a 'call of nature' against yonder tree when <i>that </i>happens."  They aren't always brave, and right and true, That's kinda the point.<br/>Consider the Optional Bond Rule. I hold up my token and say to you: "This is my Bond. It is my Oath, my Word. I give it to you, in promise of future aid, if you help me this day." Is it you, the player, saying this or your character? It is, in fact, both. Same words, same effect in game and in fiction. Powerful stuff. Find a way to include this in your game.<br/><br/>I'd like to hear where your design thoughts are. Also, I request that you stop Quoting entire posts in your replies. It wreaks havoc on the mouse scroller : )<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
