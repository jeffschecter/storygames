You mean like one-up's-manship?</blockquote>\nIf you need me to unpack it, you're obviously not grimdark enough to play in this game. :-)<br/><br/>I'm kidding, but it's that kind of thing\u2014the in-game bleakness crossing over into real-world unpleasantness, byzantine layers of social rules about who you're allowed to interact with. I've mostly seen it in LARPs to be honest, but it does happen in grimdark tabletops that take themselves too seriously.<br/><br/>Although, come to think of it, it's not actually one-upsmanship-type status games when it comes to grimdark problems. (Oh man, that seriously needs to be a Twitter hashtag now. "Don't you hate it when you're all ready to raise your vanquished foes to serve you forever in the eternal unholy grip of unlife, when a fucking butterfly flies into your ritual chamber and just totally ruins the mood? #grimdarkproblems") It's really about paralysis. People in real life who are depressed and fatalistic aren't fun to be around, because they don't get shit done. And I don't like RPGs where shit doesn't get done.\n<blockquote>ALSO ARE YOU PLAYING IAN CURTIS' GHOST?</blockquote>\nYep. :-) We're actually doing six characters, three players. My other character is a minotaur quarterstaff-knight.

Shake it all out, people. <br/><br/>We all set?  Good, because it's time to discuss the truth. Loving something ironically isn't loving it, it's hating it. And if you don't love "the grim darkness of the future" or any other time period, then we're not friends anymore. Warhammer Fantasy is my shit. 40K is the best. And here's why.<br/><br/>'Cause the Warhammer settings are all Adventure Time with more skulls. <br/><br/>Those settings are all about knowing that it's okay to get out of control, to constantly ramp it up, to look at "11" on the dial and think "Man, that just is not enough by half!"<br/><br/>Revel, guys! Revel in the opportunity that the Grimdark affords you. Jim and Johnzo have got it! You know what else is Grimdark? Dictionary of Mu. Shadow of Yesterday. Hell, every game of the Mountain Witch I've ever played in has been Grimdark like crazy.<br/><br/>Beneath the city is another city, populated by the buried dead of the city above. These undead inhabitants pursue new lives, build new societies, all under the feet of the unsuspecting men and women above. A young prince died recently and was buried in the royal grounds. He awoke from death to the supplication of a new court in a new throne room, and with the ears of a hundred thousand dead soldiers all awaiting his commands. <br/><br/>It takes a while to notice but no one moves quite right in the settlement of Ulon-on-May. And it's no surprise, really, once you consider that all of the people here have been hollowed out by the puppeteer bugs that infest the forest surrounding the town. Now a village of two hundred people have spindly insects living in their stomachs, arms sharp as needles poking into nerve endings to activate muscles. Summer has just bloomed, and the egg sacs are near ready to explode. <br/><br/>The warrior-priestesses of Kitharr kill their enemies out of reverence. If any other had murdered them, then their murderer certainly would not have had the respect to stand over the dying frames of their victims and breathe in their death rattle as the Kitharri do. The priestesses of the highest stations have killed hundreds, inhaling the last exhalation of each of their divine victims, and with each breath gaining new memories of lives lived. Surely if the Kitharri didn't kill, how would we know our history?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375412/#Comment_375412" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T04:52:55+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  4:52AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just ensure that someone chooses this playbook.<br/><img alt="image" src="http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/28700000/Drachenfest-2010-Avatar-of-Chaos-larp-28747263-1000-666.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375565/#Comment_375565" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T13:36:25+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  1:36PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Orlando,<br/>\n  I don't go nuts about GrimDark. But I do like some GrimDark games. For instance, I am a big fan of Exalted. What appeals to me:<br/>\n1) Every faction can honestly think of themselves as the hero or the villain. They have a real motivation as to why they do the horrible things they do. Contrast this with the Orcs of a typical D&amp;D campaign<br/>\n2) Dystopia, there is a faction that is clearly dominating and they are trying to do the right thing, but are screwing it up horribly...<br/>\n3) Empowerment, the players have the power to fix it (but there is not a good answer)...<br/>\n4) Real opposition, someone doesn't want you to succeed (and they are right to want to do it)<br/>\n<br/>\nThings I don't like about most GrimDark stuff:<br/>\n1) Signature characters, in settings like this, it pretty quickly devolves into do what you can, but avoid character X (Mask of Winters or Mahasuchi are great examples of this)<br/>\n2) Metaplot, usually the metaplot evolves over time and ruins the game play that has occurred at the table.<br/>\n3) Power creep, for most of these games, the power level just keeps going up in the supplements and adventures until you are no longer the underdog anymore...<br/>\n4) Splat attack, just about the time you have a good handle on everything, a new splat comes out and as a GM you have to make sense of it all.<br/>\n5) Art, the art in most of these games is pretty bad. I know when I was a teen, I had a certain appreciation for it. But nowadays, I get my porn on the internet, lol<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, in my favorite game of Exalted, I gave the PCs enough XPs that they could take on Mask of Winters (about 750 XPs, FYI) and let them determine the course of their own destiny. It was fun and their favorite encounter was a Fae Prince named Elric that was on vacation in the East of Creation and had his personal guard (about 10,000 Fae warriors). they really liked him.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, for my next campaign, it is going to be a street-level campaign where the characters are constantly pursued by DBs and Rival Solars. I don't think there is a satisfying way to do a mid tier campaign in GrimDark, you either have to have the power and need to figure out how to use it or you need to be severely downtrodden...<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
