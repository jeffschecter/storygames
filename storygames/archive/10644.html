Thoughts for a first-time GM of IAWA?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236109/#Comment_236109" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-07T10:07:23+00:00" title="October  7, 2009 10:07AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My IaWA tips<br/>\n<br/>\n1) don't make the mistake of thinking the game runs itself.  You may not have any scenario prep to do...but you need to be a strong GM.  IME in the absence of a strong GM the game will either flail, or one of the other players will pick up the slack and start doing the things the GM needs to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Don't let players get away with selecting characters who are tangental to the conflict sources in the oracle.  After you've done your brainstorming session about what characters the oracle selects, be aggressive at combining several of them together...thus tieing that one character to multiple things.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Be ruthless when setting Best Interests for your NPCs.  Target PCs for destruction and create Best Interests that will divide PCs who otherwise might become "allies by default".  (i.e. its your best interest to help this guy and hurt that guy...when those guys would otherwise think they should be friends).<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Make sure you understand the Stick and what its for.  Conflicts are not about resolving stuff, they're about awarding the stick...which is the power to say "accept this thing as fact or suffer damage".  Make sure players understand that damage is a death spiral and in a one shot especially one that can cut your effectiveness dramatically.  Think hard before you take damage before accepting the other players terms.  As GM make sure the players understand that the system is about the winner making the loser squirm about the terms they're being asked to accept.  I don't know if its an official GM power in the rules (I don't think it is but it should be) don't let winners of conflict be lazy with weak terms or just force injury/exhaustion.<br/>\n<br/>\n5) For a one shot...skip the We Owe List (which is pretty meaningless outside of a campaign) and just award d6s directly like hero points.  Using one of those d6s out of your bonus pool is mechanically the same thing as crossing your name off the "We Owe List" but a much more tactile way of doing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI could probably think of several others.  Revisiting the "Bad Habits" thread on the Lumpley forum on the Forge would be a good place to start.  I'd link to it, but net nanny won't let me go to the Forge to find it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236121/#Comment_236121" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-07T10:53:44+00:00" title="October  7, 2009 10:53AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The GM has primarily 2 jobs: Frame scenes (by introducing that first scene, and after that you can get by with "Where are you right now?") and use the NPCs to put pressure on the PCs.

And Vincent, rightly, asked, "why? It's not in the rules to do that at all!" Say what you DO that the other guy responds "Oh, no you fucking don't, asshole!" and BAM roll for the first round, the winner stating advantage, etc. Pay particular attention tot he sample conflicts:they range over space (and time!) and might start in a struggle over one thing only to end with an entirely different statement of terms by the stick-holder.<br><br>A small codicil to this is don't state results, state attempts. Sure, most people do a sort of unconscious, automatic retcon if their "I smash you in the mouth" is challenged and they lose (the winner might narrate," You swing, but I duck and now you're off-balance"). But it's best to initiate a conflict with attempting something, not stating it as <i>fait accomplis</i>.<br><br/><b>There are no talking conflicts</b> - Your guy can say all he wants, and he SAYS it: done. The other guy might smash you in the mouth (and you might say ONYFDA!), but there are no "I convince him I'm right" statements of intent. At BEST, you can beat his ass down, end up with the stick, and make him SAY, "OK, uncle, uncle! You're right"... but that has not one whit of factuality, nor does it have one whit of persuasive appeal to him. You've forced him to terms which make him say something, not BELIEVE it.<br/>-----<br/>I'll add another one that might not be "canon," but it's sort of in between the lines of the RAW:<br/><br/><b>Match the scopes of Particular Strengths</b> - Now, sure, it shouldn't MUCH matter if someones PS scope (i.e. efficacy in a variety of situations) is broader than the other... but it can make for some "huh... that's kind of bogus" feelings at some tables if there is TOO great a disparity. For instance, "Awesome Swordsman" is no where NEAR as useful in a variety of conflicts as "Agile as a chimp" or similar. If things get TOTALLY confused, then just Say Yes--sure, use that PS if you can give me even a faint notion of how it would apply to the emerging conflict. it is better if everyone's PS is in every conflict than if one guy's is in every conflict while others struggle to shape the narrative to suit their PSes or never get to instantiate their dice.<br/><br/>But, you know... play that one by ear and be receptive to the cues your players give you. I've heard "forget about PSes" before, too (but that's pretty much the "sorcery" to its "sword," if you're going all Hyborian with it!).<br/><br/>HTH                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236146/#Comment_236146" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-07T12:07:07+00:00" title="October  7, 2009 12:07PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 7, 2009 12:10PM by Valamir.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good point on the Stakes David.  I hinted at that with Conflict don't resolve stuff, but you hit it better.  I'd expand Ryan's list of GM's tasks to include keeping an ear out for when a player says "No you didn't" even when they actually didn't SAY "no you didn't".<br/>\n<br/>\nand #6) I think this is important for a one shot.  I don't know how canonical it is, but I'd tend to encourage enforceable agreements.  Otherwise you run the risk of a player agreeing to terms like "ok I'll help you recover your throne" and then later skipping out on them.  In a campaign this is less of an issue because a) you have a group who's playing together for a long time and b) it'll come back to haunt you later, but for a one shot it can feel really weak to win a dice off and then have the other player just reneg on whatever they'd agreed to do.  I can think of situations where that wouldn't feel totally weak...but I can think of more where it would.  So my advice if such should come up...allow retro active Injury or Exhaustion.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance. "Agree to help me assassinate Thibauline, or I'll hit you with the stick"..."Ok"...&lt;later&gt; "now we will go after Thibauline"..."nah, I don't really feel like it"...&lt;Bam, then you're getting hit with the stick&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn otherwords, I recommend allowing the threat of the stick to be held over the loser's head indefinitely (until you feel like the intended purpose in the fiction has been fulfilled) rather than letting players get out of injury by agreeing to something they have no intention of making good on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as Particular Strengths.  You won't see (probably) how amazingly awesome Particular Strengths are in a one shot, but they are fantastic in campaigns where they basically become a deck of created setting elements.  When "The Poisoner's Art" becomes a Particular Strength that is available for anyone to take when its not being used...it establishes something in your world.  We had one "Devouring Hunger" which returned repeatedly and became a common trait for demonic characters to possess.  We had another one "Loyalty"...which since it was given the "unique" tag really established something about the world...and the character who took it.  In a campaign when they start to level up, they get really cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236151">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236151/#Comment_236151" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-07T12:22:58+00:00" title="October  7, 2009 12:22PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [Aside: Cool notion of "PS Deck," Ralph--I've never thought of that... but I mainly have played one-shots. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> But, yeah, wow... it DOES say something BIG if "Loyalty" is unique and becomes something folks return to again and again.

This will just happen to be whichever player happened to meet the criteria first...which to me has no meaning of significance.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter you've got 3-4 chapters under your belt and the list has been seeded with many names from different chapters and different players, and names have been crossed off and players are strategicly choosing which of their characters names to cross off...and this has been happening multiple times...THEN you have a meaningful list.  One that actually reflects the aggregation of the players' burgeoning understanding of which characters they REALLY care about seeing come back.  The first few chapters are just seeding the list with names...there's no Wow factor there...it might as well be random for all the meaning it has.  So if you're only playing the first 2-3 chapters...you're never going to see the real power of the Owe list even if you maintain it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf this is going to be the first of several such one shots that will periodically be revisiting the same characters...then sure...but then its really not a one shot.  If there is little chance of ever seeing Chapters 4-6 then there's little chance of seeing anything exciting happen on the Owe list that's worth the effort and confusion of  maintaining it IMO.<br/>\n<br/>\nFurther, if you are playing with a new group of players...the degree of them grokking the point of the Owe List and how important it is to be the first person on it...probably less than playing with veterans.  So the first player to make the list will likely just be random coincidence anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are going to play multiple Chapters, I'd just go with the simpler system of whoever has the most bonus d6s in their pool.  This would be the equivalent of the character that got added to the Owe list the most times without crossing their name off...rather than the character that got added to the Owe list first without crossing their name off.  Which for a one shot is, IMO alot more meaningful of a measure.  Because it means that players can meaningfully shoot for being that return character starting 1/2 way through play when they finally twig to what's happening...rather than being "stuck" behind whoever coincidentally was first, hoping they'll cross themselves off.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there are a couple of players ahead of you on the list, and its clear they aren't likely to cross themselves off...then being on the list is pointless except as a bonus in a one shot (even of multiple chapters)...so for a one-shot...I recommend saving yourself the trouble and just treating it like a bonus.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236178">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236178/#Comment_236178" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-07T13:38:30+00:00" title="October  7, 2009  1:38PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think the one-two-three shot of In A Wicked Age needs to have an Owe List that is rich with implicit value judgments about the characters in the fiction.

I can't recall the first person on the We Owe list staying there all Chapter... I can't even recall a demo game where everyone didn't at least once get on it and scratch themselves off it. Maybe I mis-present the point of it (yours: to build a stable of characters and then eventually winnow it down to those of maximum interest and impact? A "PC Deck" to go with your "PS Deck?"). Maybe the folks to whom I demo take greater individual agency in their characters and, as such, REALLY don't want to lose and so REALLY pull for that d6. And others know how to "bank" We Owe dice--intentionally going weak into a conflict about which they don't REALLY care, to know that d6 is up there waiting when it's all-or-nothing time.<br><br>Heh... the only time the first person on We Owe stayed there all game... was when Mark Causey demoed it an an NC Game Day and told the table he'd give a spare copy of the rules to whomever was at the top at the end of the session. Needless to say (hey, I'm a GAMER, man!), I was rolling d4+d6 in my first conflict, and never thought of that d6 again. &gt;:&gt; (In my defense, I've demoed it a LOT since then--probably WAY more than anyone else at the table would have--and so I've done right by Vincent, at least.)<br><br>Maybe you could unpack (still more, I know!) this idea of "Chapter 4 We Owe Blooming." Maybe I'm confused because the RAW seems to suggest that ANY character CAN come back, just that the top one is guaranteed, if desired in the subsequent Chapter. So I'm not seeing the strategy emerge from "hmmm... who do I cross off" because, in the end, it's just a d6 for that dude, some day, maybe, if you ever play him again.

That chapter becomes sort of their "spot light" chapter and there's nothing much more of interest to know about them.  Similarly, characters struggling with signficant adversity still have a story to tell (unless, the mechanics suggest, they get so blown out by that adversity they aren't suited to having a story worth telling).<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of that is the abstract thought behind why the We Owe list was set up the way it was.  In theory then, the list will get populated by characters facing signficant challenge (tougher opponents) who survived that challenge to fight another day (lasted past the first round).<br/>\n<br/>\nMaking the decision to take the bonus die or not is thus the choice between "this character still has future stories to tell worth telling" (not taking it) vs. "THIS is the chapter that is the climax of the character's story" (taking it, and forgoing future story presence).<br/>\n<br/>\nThis situation doesn't really start to gell, however, until you've gone through a few iterations with it.  Once you, David, have several different characters on the We Owe list you start to have meaningful choices to make.  "Alfredo" is nearing the top of the list and you'll have a chance to play him again.  But "Burgiss" is in trouble right now.  Choosing or not choosing to cross off Alfredo to give Burgiss a die is you choosing whose story you're more interested in -- Burgiss's story right now or Alfredo's story in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, muddying the waters a bit is the allowance that you can bring back a character even if they're not on the We Owe List as long as they fit one of the character concepts in the Oracle.  That does IMO lessen the true power of the We Owe List but is consistant with the Vincent Baker school of design that says "give your players the ability to do what feels right to them".  And in practice, it works.  We used it a couple of times.  However, it means your character is altered by the Oracle.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you're at the top of the We Owe List...you're coming back...as your own character...unchanged except as you want to change them.  When you point to an oracle that reads "A wizened old man seeking bloody vengeance" and say "Hey, that's Alfredo"...then you've allowed the oracle to change your character.  If he wasn't a wizened old man before, he is now...and whatever that vengeance is, its on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were a number of times we used this in our campaign, but always the character was radically impacted.  The one I remember most is when I pointed to "The ghost of a man murdered by his own daughter" and said "that's Zahir".  Up to that point Zahir had been my main reoccuring character, but due to a fairly climactic previous Chapter he was no longer on the Owe list, even though his presence in this Chapter made sense from the organically emerging story arc.  In that selection we discovered, Zahir had a daughter...and had died.  In the process of establishing those events we decided that Zahir had finally married the woman he'd been pursuing the entire story...one of the other characters...who WAS the We Owe character in this chapter, IIRC.  So here, the single most important event in Zahir's life...the culmination of what he'd been wanting since the very first Chapter...happened...but it happened off stage.  Clearly indicating Zahir was not the protaganist of this story.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's one of IaWA's most endearing features, IMO.  Once we got into it we started speculating on which of the recurring cast of characters would wind up being the true protagonist of the story.  Regularly we were surprised when their stories took a turn in a different direction.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo ANY character CAN come back...but if you're playing right IMO, there will be certain characters that clearly "need to" and others that clearly don't.  And as a group I would recommend ample use of peer pressure to assure that the right choices get made.  And I believe (may be wrong) that RAW the GM has final authority over approving whether any potential oracle character can be claimed to be a PC or not.  That's certainly the way I'd play it if its not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236218/#Comment_236218" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-07T15:10:32+00:00" title="October  7, 2009  3:10PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is all remarkably helpful.

Like Ryan, I've run a number of IAWA games as one-chapter, one-session games, and have had nothing but success. So much so that it is hands-down my game of choice for a pick-up game or an "evening with non-gamers".<br><br>Since so many people seem to feel differently, though, I'm gonna try my next IAWA game with short chapters and see how it runs that way.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236437/#Comment_236437" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-08T16:13:28+00:00" title="October  8, 2009  4:13PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Random rules query - for Particular Strengths.<br><br>Is there any reason not to assign one to your character?                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236455/#Comment_236455" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-08T17:15:09+00:00" title="October  8, 2009  5:15PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I <i>say</i> 1 chapter = 1 hour.

Any Big Player PC (or Big Threat PC/NPC) is going to have a PS, if only to have mechanical efficacy in conflicts (i.e. Sauron doesn't get bitch-slapped).<br/><br/>But, as always, efficacy isn't the end all be all, here. I see the Everyman character as (a) all-but-living on the We Owe list, (b) a thematic position of accepting the whims of fate (and others), and (c) ultimately a very sympathetic character (OOC), whose player might adroitly manipulate the story though sheer patheticness (yes, that word's under debate--DON'T HIT ME, MASSAH!).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236577/#Comment_236577" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-09T08:49:04+00:00" title="October  9, 2009  8:49AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, and also, sometimes you don't have a clear picture of what your character's Particular Strength is until you've played them a bit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236589/#Comment_236589" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-09T09:37:34+00:00" title="October  9, 2009  9:37AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We played last night - it was really great (I thought) and it helped me a lot to have your input on how things could go.  Big ups to Joe and Johnstone for helping out on the rules during the game.  <br/><br/>I can't imagine playing IAWA without the Owe List or the idea of rolling characters from one game to the next.  I mean, conceptually, sure, but in play, it's so much more fun to jockey for position and be able to see how the game might work in the long run.  We ended up playing two stories, one of which was truncated, but I think people got the idea.  I'd like to be able to play it over a longer period of time where 1 session = 1 story.  The stories felt a little rushed, though I tend to drag things out when I GM - I always want "epic" and have trouble with short stories to begin with.<br/><br/>Anyway, long story short, thanks, everyone, for all your help!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237478/#Comment_237478" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-14T12:00:55+00:00" title="October 14, 2009 12:00PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Replace the word "story" with "chapter," and you'll prolly be able to relax into the short form more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_237593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237593/#Comment_237593" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-14T18:16:11+00:00" title="October 14, 2009  6:16PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes.
