I got the idea last Thursday while re-listening to Ogre's interview with Ben Lehman (<a href="http://stabbingcontest.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=324349" rel="nofollow">Stabbing Contest episode 12, Ben Lehman pt. 2</a>, timestamp 29:06--thanks Ogre &amp; Ben!). And anyway, it's playtestable now.<br/><br/>It's a real simple little game, ripping off the scene-setup-and-resolution mechanic from Ben Robbins' not-yet-released <a href="http://www.lamemage.com/blog/index.php/87/what-is-microscope/" rel="nofollow">Microscope</a> (thanks Ben!--he said I could).<br/><br/>copy + pasted from the Forge:<br/><br/>So, the rules:<br/><br/>-<b>The game is played through texting messages back-and-forth</b>.<br/>-<b>2 players</b>: this is you &amp; friend.<br/>-<b>2 characters</b>: this is your playing piece in the game, whom you create with words.<br/>-<b>No more than 10 messages each, though if the game finishes before that it's fine</b>.<br/>-<b>No more than 3 sentences per text</b>.<br/>-<b>Player 1 chooses the situation, Player 2 chooses the setting</b>. The situation is the point of play: what is the answer to the question? We don't know, and we find out by playing. Once the question is answered, the game is over. Don't rush toward the answer. You have 10 turns, and it's an intimate setting. The point of play, is to play, and end when you reach the end condition. The setting is color for both of you to hook into, no more no less. Let it breathe.<br/>-<b>Once the situation and setting are chosen and communicated, each player creates a character</b>. You do this by looking at the people around you and picking one or tweaking one to make her grabby--one or two adjectives, a word about a single standout element of looks/clothing, that's it. You don't need to write about your character before the game proper starts: introduce her in your first turn. Include a name, if you wish.<br/>-<b>You say what your character does and says, and not what the other character does and says</b>. You can include other, new, spontaneously created characters, and both players get them as an additional playing piece, to do what they want with. Any other setting element also belongs to both players.<br/>-<b>The game starts with player 1 playing their first turn, then Player 2, then Player 1, alternating until the end</b>. If you're getting to your last message or three, begin to draw things to a close. Think of pulling a drawstring on a bag, slowly, steadily, definitively.<br/>-<b>There is no time limit</b>. The nice thing about texting is that you can play this through the day, at work or wherever. I figure games will range from 30 minutes (for those doing nothing else) to a day or two. In any case, don't expect your playing partner to respond immediately. He'll do so when he can. Still, if it's been a half a day or so with no reply, maybe see what's going on.<br/><br/>some advice: Take what the other player says and build on it, like you're both making a lego tower. Don't knock it down! Let their turns inform yours, such that the answer to the situation, the ending of play, is something you've both created and had input into, even though it may be fully revealed in one player's turn.<br/><br/><b>the situations</b>: player 1, choose one<br/><br/>1. Does the Jilted choose love over vengeance?<br/>2. Why does the boy not speak?<br/>3. Does the mother give in to her addiction?<br/>4. What caused the man to finally show a real smile?<br/>5. What is hidden in their father's secret laboratory?<br/><br/><b>the setting</b>: player 2, choose one<br/><br/>1. An abandoned beach house, salt &amp; sand in every crack.<br/>2. A wet, black, night, under the single orange lamp of a streetlight.<br/>3. In the dead husk of the sugar factory, the setting sun glinting off broken glass.<br/>4. Just before dawn at the ballfield, with fog-horns in the distance.<br/>5. In the wheat fields the day before harvest: a flaxen sea of silence.<br/><br/><br/>commentary: So, yes, I just kind of brainstormed those situations &amp; settings on a whim, though the settings at least seemed to take on a theme all their own. Basically, these are all for playtest purposes, to see what people make out of them, and what kind of packed little scenes they generate. The game doesn't have a title yet, but I've got at least one brewing.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you want to play this with me, send me a whisper or email (click on my name), and I'll give you my phone number. Or if you play it with someone else, come back and let me know how it goes. Thanks, folks. I hope this works, but who knows? I'm excited.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277078">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277078/#Comment_277078" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-21T10:07:29+00:00" title="June 21, 2010 10:07AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't bite.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277202/#Comment_277202" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-21T23:09:53+00:00" title="June 21, 2010 11:09PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 21, 2010 11:10PM by Hans_c-o.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is this laming people out?<br/><br/>Basically, I'd like to know why, if you clicked this link, this doesn't grab you.<br/><br/>Not immediately grabby enough (i.e., no "elevator pitch")?<br/>Doesn't seem fun?<br/>Not interested in a text-msg game?<br/>Worried about an internet-person having your phone #?<br/>Something else?<br/><br/>I'm not trolling for sympathy or cheerleaders--just perhaps a better way to present the game such that some people will want to play it with me!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277204">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EnricPDX" title="EnricPDX"><img alt="EnricPDX" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EnricPDX">EnricPDX</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277204/#Comment_277204" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-21T23:18:20+00:00" title="June 21, 2010 11:18PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hans, I'm totally down for trying this.

The things that inspire me in roleplaying games tend to have to do with emergent content, social interaction and creative tension. Having two guys cooperate in creating a story, with well-defined turns of speaking or not, feels like old hat without a rules system that forces me away from the familiar conventions and demands us to transcend the ordinary and do something exceptional. I can appreciate it that some might find doing this interesting if their everyday job is not very creative and they want the thrill of creativity in a package that helps get over the initial consternation and white page syndrome.<br/><br/>Using text messages is somewhat novel, but by itself it does nothing to turn a game of "let's make a story by stringing sentences in turns" into anything more than itself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277335/#Comment_277335" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-22T11:42:10+00:00" title="June 22, 2010 11:42AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't see from the write-up how the game is going to do anything cool.

Thanks. Still, I don't mind it being old hat (it doesn't seem really innovative to me--I just took a couple concepts that weren't mine and mashed them together and it intrigued me), but if I ever want to attract people to it I'll have to think about that.<br/><br/>And Paul, your whole post makes sense. This is still an embryonic idea, and I suppose I have to touch things and move them to see how they work/if they work. Anyway, I suppose it's more of a loose structure for creating micro-fiction, and it that sense it's more of a structure and less of a game, at this point.

In that game, you (among other things) have scenes wherein the whole setup is a question, and then you freeform roleplay and whenever the table feels like the question has been resolved the scene ends. For me, it hit a kind of sweet spot between structure and free play. Anyway, I'm not trying to invalidate your questions, because I think they're good, but I also think a game can have a really light touch with regard to those questions and still be totally playable. Which, of course, isn't a way of saying that my little game thing is good.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: chearns</cite>Also, the situations presented, I keep wondering why they were gendered, why is it a boy instead of a child?

Totally squirm. Basically it was gendered because I thought writing "Why does the child not speak?" was a little boring. I chose genders arbitrarily (as much as I can know that I did), other than the mother, because I thought that a father with a drug problem, choosing whether or not to give it up for his kid was a more typical story and I wanted to go against the norm. <br/><br/>Anyway, your gender points are valid and if I ever do anything more with this game I'll definitely change it up (or make it neutral), so people don't get the wrong idea, but I think you're reading into it too much.<br/><br/>Thanks for the comments!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277657">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277657/#Comment_277657" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-24T08:38:07+00:00" title="June 24, 2010  8:38AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hans,\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: hans otterson</cite>I dunno, I guess it made sense to me because I've played Microscope.

It was okay, but it's really just a simple exercise in collaborative micro-fiction through texting, which I found out I'm not really interested in, so I'm not going to work on this further. I mean, there were problems with it beyond that--I'm not saying it would be a good game for someone interested in doing an rpg-like activity through texting--but I don't care to work on the problems, as even if it were well-designed I don't think I like playing this kind of game. Thanks for your thoughts, Paul, Nathan, Eero, and Christopher, and to Harry for trying it out with me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
