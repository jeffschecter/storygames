The game setting is somehow low fantasy and quite realistic (limited magic - if you can call that realistic, - monsters as savage beasts rather than evil beings, mercenary work, and so on). What I hope is that these pieces of fiction will in the end contribute to evoke the setting more than pages and pages of precise descriptions.<br/><br/>Basically, although there are a few clear indications about the setting in the game text, with the fiction I hope to give it more color.<br/><br/>What I usually do not like, in the fiction inserted in RPGs, is that it <i>states</i>, rather than <i>suggesting and evoking</i>. So I decided that these brief pieces of fiction would actually be very brief (i.e. one page long, A5, not more). Plus they would not be consequential, nor always about the same characters, and they would not have a clear ending but be instead left open (I realize now they could serve as adventures seeds as well...).<br/><br/>Do you have any suggestions, any warnings, any thoughts on the matter?<br/><br/>Moreover - English is not my native language. I tried writing first in Italian and then translating, but this served me rather poorly. So I did a lot of reading in English (so that I would somehow "train" my brain to mimic what I'm reading), and gave it a shot at writing directly in English. Is anyone interested in giving a look at just a few pages? Would it be too much of an abuse to post these pieces here, once I've written a few them?<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432839/#Comment_432839" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-19T17:27:07+00:00" title="May 19, 2014  5:27PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Davide,<br/><br/>You gave me some good feedback on my recent game, so I'll be more than happy to take a look and give you some feedback!<br/><br/>I think the most important part might to be very clear *before* you start writing what function you want the fiction to serve. Is the idea to "set the mood" to the reader? Is it intended to be used as a potential adventure seeds?<br/><br/>Personally, the idea that excites me in your post is the suggestion that someone picking up the book/game could read the bit of fiction out loud, and then start playing immediately (e.g. an open-ended scenario starter with a character sheet provided). That would be pretty cool, I think!<br/><br/>But I'll have a look no matter what you decide - that's just something that jumped out at me.<br/><br/>You might also consider how some short games that are very good at creating setting expectations and flavour do this economically (some of John Harper's games come to mind, as do some of Vincent Baker's, Fiasco playsets, etc.), and borrowing some techniques or tricks from them for your own project.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432841">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432841/#Comment_432841" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-19T19:19:50+00:00" title="May 19, 2014  7:19PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 19, 2014 10:32PM by AsIf.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The world is full of documents, both fictional and non-fictional.  Why not use some pieces of (fictional) non-fiction?  In my experience, players usually enjoy being handed one of these paper "props".  (As long as it's not the kind of thing where you must study the prop to find answers to puzzles.  That removes the game from roleplay and turns it into puzzle-solving, so its usefulness depends on the type of players you have.)<br/><br/>\xb7 Poems and songs can create a mood while providing historical details that can inform the players about the world or culture.  <br/><br/>\xb7 Written documents and maps - even if you cannot understand the writing - evoke the psychology of the people and cultures who created them.  Fonts and alphabets can have their own cultural character as well.<br/><br/>\xb7 Handwritten notes from NPCs can be telling in ways that go beyond the content they carry.  They can be especially expository if they're written by major personages in the gameworld.<br/><br/>\xb7 If your world has anything like newspapers - even handwritten parchments or propaganda pamphlets - these could provide descriptions of various events from the perspective of an NPC (writer, reporter, pamphleteer for the Common Good, political group, religious zealot, etc).  Players might even be able to track this character down and meet them.<br/><br/>If you're looking for examples of English writers with a good, fast, evocative, fantasy style, I think you can't go wrong with Fritz Lieber's <i>Lankhmar</i> books (the "Swords of" series, featuring Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432847/#Comment_432847" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-19T22:17:52+00:00" title="May 19, 2014 10:17PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't put fiction in your RPG, that's what players are for.

Play examples are also a wonderfully sneaky place to add important and interesting details to your setting. If the example for how to use a magical research skill has Grignr the sample PC flipping through dusty tomes in The Most High Temple of His Occult Majesty, now everyone who's read the description of the magical research skill knows that there IS such a place (and presumably an Occult Majesty somewhere, too).<br/><br/>You could almost certainly accomplish every single one of your goals -- lively characters, color to the setting, adventure seeds -- without ever once spending an entire page writing a short story (and translating it to English). Every play example and skill description you write is an opportunity to do one or two or all of those things, in a place where people are <i>much</i> more likely to actually read it.<br/><br/><br/>(And if you still have the desire to write short fiction burning inside you, do it as its own separate thing rather than part of your main rulebook. Put it up on your website or something, maybe.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432850">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/davidepignedoli" title="davidepignedoli"><img alt="davidepignedoli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/davidepignedoli">davidepignedoli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432850/#Comment_432850" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-20T00:08:27+00:00" title="May 20, 2014 12:08AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 20, 2014 12:08AM by davidepignedoli.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi everybody and thanks for the feedback!<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> - thanks, indeed <i>setting a clear goal</i> is the most important thing. On the other hand, as <a href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">@AccountingForTaste</a> wrote, perhaps all goals are within reach, using the proper approach...<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">@JDCorley</a> - I've read your brief comment and thought: "WTF? like that? sugarcoat it a bit, men." and then... "mmmh, well, he's onto something". You definitely have a point there. I don't think that <i>only</i> examples of play will reach the goal I have in mind (I want to leave the reader trying to figure out how that story began and how it will end), but I will mix the two approaches.<br/><br/>So I tried to gather all these useful suggestions and came up with this...<br/><br/>First: I will start by putting into the game some fiction pieces. Their <i>main goal</i> will be giving color and setting the mood. This will be in the first part of the book, where the reader is still getting into the game, but has a limited knowledge of the mechanics. Still, within these little pieces of fiction, I will bury the seeds both of potential characters (or NPCs) and adventures.<br/><br/>Here are a few examples: <br/><br/><a href="http://www.daimongames.com/ironworld/download/1.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.daimongames.com/ironworld/download/1.pdf</a><br/><br/><a href="http://www.daimongames.com/ironworld/download/2.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.daimongames.com/ironworld/download/2.pdf</a><br/><br/><a href="http://www.daimongames.com/ironworld/download/3.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.daimongames.com/ironworld/download/3.pdf</a><br/><br/>Please let me know, if you read them, if you think they serve the purpose (first - color and mood; secondly - character/NPCs and adventure seeds).<br/><br/>In the second part of the book, once the mechanics are clear to the reader, I will try to present the fiction as an example of play. In my head this is like: first you read of a certain imaginary world, its people, its adventures, then you learn the game rules, and then you read some more fiction, but this time you have a chance of looking inside the machine, you know the rules, and you see the gears in motion. If that works, I guess it could be a pretty good approach. (I do not have yet examples for this part of the book, though)<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Aslf">@Aslf</a> - thanks for the suggestions... I will check Fritz Lieber's stuff. As for your suggestions, they're interesting, but not quite what I had in mind. They would probably work very well within the context of an adventure, but I am not sure I want to get to that within the manual itself. But as for the map, for example, the game has a sort of a Middle Age setting. So I plan for the maps to be exactly as you wrote. They will look like old maps, will have errors, blanks, cryptic notes. I guess in the Middle Age most people barely knew what was behind the next hill - I presume they had no idea of how the entire world looked like. Plus, mistakes and blanks, I presume will give the GM plenty to work with...<br/><br/>thanks again for all your precious suggestions!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432853/#Comment_432853" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-20T06:23:59+00:00" title="May 20, 2014  6:23AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right on.  I was certainly blurring the line between rules and adventure details, trying to come up with things that would be useful to the players as well as to the GM.  Pull-outs or hand-outs, etc.  Don't forget that the book may <i>include</i> a sample adventure.  And that players rarely read the book. :-)<br/><br/>Here's one more approach: Split the page into 2 columns.  Put pure fiction on the left and explain it in game moves on the right.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432855/#Comment_432855" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-20T06:52:42+00:00" title="May 20, 2014  6:52AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Don't put fiction in your RPG, that's what players are for.

Also, I like several little snippets better than a long introductory text to a setting. I <i>always</i> skip the long introductions. I want to tell <i>my</i> story. If I want to read a story by someone else, I read a book.<br/>Also, the story should involve the background, possibly NPCs but never my PCs. <br/><br/>A good example for me is <i>Little Fears - Nightmare Edition</i>: Short introductory text(s) at the beginning of the book (or chapters) to set the mood and then a lot of examples within the rules.<br/><br/>Another thing I like is the Fate <i>Dresden Files RPG books</i> (Vol 1+2): There are small post-its, annotations and notes throughout the whole book that reflect the humor of Dresden Files.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
