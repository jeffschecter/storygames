                    hello this is my second post.<br/>
um...i was wondering if anyone has tried using the I Ching as a resoultion mechanic for an rpg?  i've used it, i guess with it's intended purpose, in a kind of interesting way.  well, at least i think it's interesting.  i use two eight-sided dice, one different colored one repressents the "top trigram"(heaven) while another colored one repressents the "bottom one"(man).  just thought i'd pass this along, i've been thinking alot about approach in game mechanics and relationships between attributes/traits.                </div>

                            Sounds like a neat approach. If I remember right there are 64 hexagrams, which might be a little over the top if you want the game resolution to not involve a massive lookup table. The trigrams do sound like a better idea.<br/><br/>For those unfamiliar with the I Ching, the eight trigrams are as follows (using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a> as a reference):<br/><br/>1 Force/Heaven/Northwest<br/>2 Open/Swamp/West<br/>3 Radiance/Fire/South<br/>4 Shake/Thunder/East<br/>5 Ground/Wind/Southeast<br/>6 Gorge/Water/North<br/>7 Bound/Mountain/Northeast<br/>8 Field/Earth/Southwest<br/><br/>You could do an Everway sort of interpretive system with this, since they're not ranked in order of importance or anything like that. You could also have a little chart on your sheet (perhaps arranged like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagua_%28concept%29" rel="nofollow">Bagua</a>) to give an idea of how useful rolling up a certain hexagram would be for different situations. You could even use the central items on the list above as elements for a magic-oriented game.                        </div>

                            yeah, i think the mechanic has legs but how to tie it into character, tone, story and setting.  yeah, the two different eight-siders is a bit easier than yarrowstalks or flipping coins.  i'm not sure how close in probabilities the dice method is to the yarrowstalk/coin method, don't know if it matters, considering the fuzziness of the whole approach of probabilites is kinda antithesis to the whole "fate" thing.  <br/>

                            The Yi Jing (I Ching) is used as part of setting content and graphic design in a lot of games, but I don't know that many ones which have successfully used is as part of the mechanics, though many designers have fiddled with the <i>bagua</i> (eight trigrams).  I think there was a game from the recent Reverse/Engineer contest that made an attempt.<br/><br/>While 64 is a lot of hexagrams, I think it could be fairly easy to look them up if they were all listed on a sheet and were arranged in an order that made it easy to find them. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching#The_hexagrams" rel="nofollow">The traditional order</a> probably isn't your best bet in this regard. You might want something more like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching#Hexagram_Lookup_Table" rel="nofollow">lookup table</a> that some books include.<br/><br/>I think 2d8, with one die marked as the first trigram, is a fine way of generating hexagrams. It might not have the same traditional feel as coins or yarrow sticks, but it's a lot simpler, if you just want it to run quickly.                        </div>

                            I'm working on something similar; a kind of I Ching with the serial numbers filed off sort of deal.  In essence, cards are used to represent trigrams (four suits of eight cards each, lettered A through H and given a fantasy-language name:  ael, bes, cadh, din, eth, fel, ghot, hin).  Each letter and each suit has pretty standard tarot-like meaning.  That is, the suits are Swords, Coins, Stars, and Staves, while the letters are Child, Lady, Man, Tree, Mountain, Moon, Sun, and World.  Each card thus has a range of pretty concrete meanings (Child of Swords?  A young warrior!  No, a dreadful wound!)<br/><br/>The beauty part is that the resolution of actions is driven by the interaction of the trigram-like cards, which combine to produce a hexagrammatic oracular meaning.  So AB (ael bes) is "Initiative" or "The one who acts strikes the first blow or makes the first move. His action brings some advantage" while BA (bes ael) is "Folly" or "The one who acts is led astray by his choice. He makes himself vulnerable to the stratagems of his enemies."<br/><br/>So cards are played to introduce setting elements ("I play Man of Swords.  I'm a mighty warrior, on a mission for my king"; "Oh yeah?  I play Tree of Stars; the king's enemies are on your trail") while the juxtaposition of cards suggests some resolution ("Hmm...that's cadh din, Arrival.  The one who acts comes to a stopping-place. This place may not be the end, but a leg of his journey is complete."  "Well, then, clearly my warrior has arrived at the cave of the hermit who is supposed to guide me on the next step of my quest.  Any sign of the man?")<br/><br/>And so forth.<br/><br/>More <a href="http://billwhite.blogspot.com/2006/01/rune-saga-creating-characters.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.                        </div>

I have to dig through my boxes, but yes, I have it. It was a thin softcover, about 60-80 pages. It was not translated. It briefly mentioned a (fantasy) setting, and a world book/supplement was announced but never materialized.<br/><br/>I can tell you more when I have it my hands.<br/><br/>Dirk                        </div>

That's gotta be speculation. We don't really have any records from around the time when Fu Xi supposedly invented the trigrams. Which makes it difficult to know how they arose or what their intended purpose was.                        </div>

                            Nate, I've thought about this occasionally too.<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion would be to ditch the "fortune" method (i.e., using dice, coins, stalks, whatever), and have the player and his opponent select trigrams.  The player would select an Inner Trigram, reflecting the archetypal nature of his character's action, and the GM selects the Outer Trigram, reflecting the archetypes of the "GM sphere" (npcs, social conditions, whatever).  This selection is blind.  Then, the hexagram shows up.  GM interprets the Judgment, setting hard limits on what can or can't be achieved; player interprets the Image, with the superior man taking the role of the character.<br/>
<br/>
Another option would involve the GM selecting the overall current hexagram-situation.  The player then states what hexagram-situation he or she is trying to create.  This would require changing certain lines.  Read the description of those lines, and factor that into the resolution somehow.  For yang lines, the odds of it changing are 37.5% plus mods; for yin lines, the odds of it changing are 12.5% plus mods.  (This is allegedly the odds of young lines using the yarrow stalk method, but I've never done the math.)  This creates a new situation, which may not be what either party intended.<br/>
<br/>
It's important to note that the I Ching is <b>all about</b> Situation, very much in the Big Model sense.  It's a Situation generator.                        </div>

<br>
     well, isn't much of life speculation?  <br>
i just remembered a passage in my copy about it's origins.  wrong or not, it makes some sense to me.  <br>
"yes" and "no" are a bit less abstract than say "mountain", "thunder", "adhereing", or "innocence".  <br>
in two of my sources it brings up the "yes=solid line" and "no=broken line".   BUT, i was not there to ask Fu Xi what he was thinking at the time.<br>
<br/>
     i like the act of choosing part of a hexagram in order to get it's whole.  it's a good idea.  it highlights player approach in a somewhat solid fashion.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Yeah, come to think of it, resources work better with my "one situation morphs into the other" approach; yang lines would cost fewer resources to change than the yin ones.  There'd have to be some kind of resource economy, so that it's not just a downhill spending spree.<br/>
<br/>
There are several impediments to using the I Ching, though, which may explain why it's never been done.  First and foremost, it takes a long time to read what's being said; it takes even longer to figure out how it applies; and then once you see how it applies, it's not clear how to read the "advice" it's giving you.<br/>
<br/>
Connected to this is the language &amp; antiquity barrier.  The Wilhelm version is a English translation of a German translation of a modern Chinese reading of a (no doubt heavily accreted) Confucian reading of a heavy accreted ancient Chinese text.  And even if the chain of translations is legit, what the hell does "It furthers to cross the great ocean" mean?  The I Ching has a stock vocabulary of extraordinarily opaque poetic images.  On repeated exposure, some of them begin to make sense ("It furthers one to cross the great water" presumably means, Go ahead and do something very risky)--but there are also a handful of unique expressions which are harder to put into context.<br/>
<br/>
For these reasons, any attempt to use the I Ching is going to boil down to Drama Resolution/fiat--and very slow, gibberish-laden fiat, at that.  It's a pity, because I think it's an interesting artifact; but it clearly wasn't designed with the needs of gamers in mind.                        </div>

                            it wouldn't be drama resolution if the constrasting elements were given a trigram, and maybe a numbered trigram?  just a thought?<br>
i think the i ching is fairly intuitive, but much depends on the situation at hand.  <br>
would the teller describe a situation using a trigram, unrevealed at first, then ask for the players trigram, and show his half, to get the answer?   i don't know.  would players not like their inital input compromised.  i'm guessing in that situation, their input/narration would be a joint effort?  <br>

                            Okay, here's my thoughts: "Let's use the <i>I Ching</i> as a resolution mechanic" doesn't tell us very much.  It's very much like saying, "Let's use playing cards as a resolution mechanic": a decent idea, but it's too vague to do much with.<br/>
<br/>
* What's the scale of resolution?  Action by action?  Conflict by conflict?  Scene by scene?  Or what?<br/>
* How's the mechanic invoked?  Players call for it?  GM calls for it?  The system calls for it at scheduled intervals?<br/>
* To what extent are the intentions of the actual and imaginary parties relevant?  How are they expressed?<br/>
* How is the casting performed?  Who performs it?<br/>
* What aspects of the hexagram are relevant?  The name?  The judgment?  The image?  The upper and lower trigrams?  The nuclear hexagram?  The individual lines?  The existence or nature a new hexagram?<br/>
* Who determines the effect of the casting, and how much effect does it have?<br/>
<br/>
Here is one possible response:<br/>
1.  Scene resolution<br/>
<br/>
2.  GM presents a bang represented by the current situation/hexagram; players try to steer toward a desired effect; after a little bit of prep to frame the scene and what's going on, break out the book.  (I.e., 'fortune-in-the-middle')  After resolution, events are narrated to make retroactive sense of the reading.<br/>
<br/>
3.  The player has to state what situation (read: hexagram) he's trying to create.  This is what the <i>player</i> wants, not necessarily what the character wants.  The GM also expresses the new situation he'd like.  If either party is happy with the status quo, they can say, "Let's keep it the way it is."  These desired hexagrams are recorded.<br/>
<br/>
4. Compare the existing situation to the desired situation.  For every yang line that changes to yin, spend 1 Coin.  For every yin line that changes to yang, spend 3 coins.  In a case where the GM and player are each trying to manipulate a single line, they spend some kind of Meta-Resource, or bid for it, or something.  If one party isn't trying to manipulate a line, nothing changes.  Each party, when manipulating a line, narrates how that line is involved.  Entertaining naration earns you a coin.  (Thus, if you're consistently entertaining, changing a yang line pays for itself.  Maybe this needs to be tweaked.)<br/>
<br/>
5.  The new hexagram: the judgment is interpreted by the GM; the image is interpreted by the player.  The new nuclear hexagram applies to the character's antagonist, if there is one.                        </div>

<p>I'd propose, if you want to design this, that you leave aside the text, and just get into what yin &amp; yang mean in terms of no more than a couple of axes.</p>
<p>E.g., roll only a single line, and take yang as "success" and yin as "failure." Now we can get into "yes, but" and "no, but," if the line is a changing one.</p>
<p>I think this would be a more workable mechanic, and could lead eventually to doing full trigrams, though I can't imagine going as far as hexagrams. But it might be fun to build up a trigram or hexagram <em>over the course</em> of several scenes and allow that to have an effect on some other thing, like advancement.</p>

                            i think scene based seems to jive with the i ching the best.  <br>
i'm sure i don't like paying to change lines.  i think it just adds unneeded complexity.  why not pay to flip the hexgram or trigram?  i mean it just get's too gamey for my tastes.  it should be about using the hexgram and trigrams well to support story creation.  the player will have control over how he approaches a problem(gm's trigram), by choosing a trigram.  what's to stop them from using the same trigram over and over again?   i'm not sure how ideal game play would work.<br>
it feels like it would be best to use the mechanic when you're uncertain of the outcome.  <br>
how i kind of saw it, is for every scene the gm picks a trigram, the heavenly side, which is i believe at the top, then describes an event leading up until the player's desires/input are needed.   <br>
this is why i posted this in little ideas.  it's still very much an idea seed.<br>

<p>Way back in the day I tossed together a fighty mechanic with majiang tiles; if you used an especially Yin or Yang technique, it would add a line to the 'weather trigram' and bump a line off the end, which would set the mood and environment of the next scene.</p>
<p>Never got to try it out, but I really liked how if you kept using Endless Hungry Void, you'd eventually have to set a scene in like Lake or Abyss.</p>

                            failure and success tell very little.  i've always hated the "you hit 'em" or "you don't hit 'em" sort of mechanics.  why someone failed or succeeded tells me much more than just if.  <br>
to me the i ching is all about approach, and that's what i like about it.  not success or failure.  <br>
i hate breaking a scene down into lines, a scene is a hexagram.  if you need to stretch it out and have mechanics to go along with that, that just means more rules for what?  you're focusing on success or failure not the meaning of the trigrams/hexagram.  yin and yang are not always yes or no, but can mean inward or outward, open or closed, hot or cold...male, female.  the lines are just there to denote balance or imbalance and to form the hexagram.  it's all about the hexagram.  <br>
so, in every scene or event closure, you'd need to succeed or fail three times for a trigram, or six for a hexagram.  why couldn't one scene just be one action?  <br>
it's limiting just for the sake of limits.  <br>

Instead of yes/no, each line of a trigram is "yes, but" or "yes, and."<br><br><img alt="image" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8e/Trigrams2.svg/399px-Trigrams2.svg.png"/><br><br>I imagine each line of the trigrams representing a gateway. When the line is broken, that's an open gate. When the line is closed, that's a barrier.<br><br>After you describe an action, look at each gate in order. If the gate is closed, that's a complication ("yes, but") that results from your action. If the gate is open, that's an additional beneficial result ("yes, and") of your action.<br><br/>And maybe you incorporate a reward mechanic for getting more closed gates, so players aren't <i>totally</i> dreading Heaven, Wind, Fire or Lake.<br/><br/>For example:<br/>Action: Iron Fist is pursuing a thief through the bamboo forest and catches him by the scruff of his neck.<br/>Fallout: Fire — That's a closed gate, followed by an open gate, ending with another closed gate. In other words, that's "Yes, but," "Yes, and" and "Yes, but." The fallout is described as follows: "Iron Fist catches the thief, [Closed Gate] but the thief was luring Iron Fist into an ambush the whole time. [Open Gate] Fortunately, Iron Fist's previous experience with the thieves' guild prepared him for this eventuality. He is unsurprised. [Closed Gate] Still, two hundred of the deadliest bandits in the city are not to be taken lightly.<br/><br/>I dunno who has authority to narrate these complications/benefits, but I thought it might spur some more thoughts on this subject.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            (wet blanket)You would, of course, have to be a bit careful if anyone who feels strongly about traditional Chinese culture was around. I can imagine people from my qigong organisation being irate if they felt it was being treated disrespectfully. So you'd want to try to avoid it looking like that.(/wet blanket)<br/><br/><br/>And no, this isn't some long-delayed revenge.  <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>

                            Yup. That's actually why I'm not using this in Do. :P Just thought I'd post it to spur some further discussion. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>
