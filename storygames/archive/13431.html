Epic GM plots. Backstory. Secrets.<br/></blockquote>\nI think this is the stuff that's as-yet less explored. Backstory has been explored a bit with flash-back mechanics, but secrets, campaigns, and epic GM plots are all pretty ripe for digging.<br/><br/>I think secrets could be used to push further into PCs-as-enemies/frenemies territory.<br/>The whole campaign thing, actually, was kind of covered in Sorcerer&amp;Sword by the concept of Fate - but a cool way to expand on S&amp;S in this regard might be to establish up-front what the ultimate fate of the PCs will be, and the point of play is to see how they get there.<br/><br/>It might be kinda neat to mess with the Epic Plot stuff by experimenting with giving players many, many characters to portray - in each thread of the overall story, maybe each player has a major character? Nestling multiple BIG plot-lines together into something that's ridiculously big and complex could be really cool, although admittedly it could be one hell of an undertaking.<br/>But to have something *really* be epic, it needs a Lazy Susan-style model for protagonism, rather than just one or a few main characters all assembled in a party. A Song of Ice and Fire comes to mind, but I suppose things went the way they did because the Stark family got scattered across the realm.<br/><br/>Maybe the old maxim of "splitting the party" could become a feature, not a problem, by turning over NPCs to the players to make into their secondary protagonists, when it makes sense.</blockquote>\nAlso, Levi, <br/>I think what you're describing is also wielded effectively by Apocalypse World - "acting under fire" is open to interpretation, for instance, despite its battle-ready implications. <br/>This is actually a game element that hugely contrasted 0e and later editions of D&amp;D - to me, 3rd edition spells are nothing *but* combat tools, while OSR games tend to have somewhat florid, open-ended descriptions of effects, the kind of thing you could build a truly awesome scheme around to really impress the GM. <br/>Overall, I think there's a balancing act to such descriptions, and it can be crucial to decide what constitutes conflict, what constitutes actual fighting, and when you can skirt around the procedures. For instance, if being damaged by a sentient/living/self-ambulatory entity initiates combat between the damager and the damagee, then knowing that "Telekinesis can move objects as fast as their falling speed" (and falling does damage) means that, while a pit trap may not initiate combat between the trap and its victim, using my telekinesis to slam you against a wall will most certainly start a fight.<br/>That could be a neat experiment - find "loopholes" that allow you to apply kewl powerz to fightin', but don't make any special abilities (bonus points - any at <i>all</i>) have textually explicit combat applications.<br/><i>Haste</i> also gives you more Dexterity, which in turn affects combat initiative.<br/><i>Goblin Mask</i> gives a huge bonus to intimidation in certain conditions (such as surprise in combat). <br/>I shall meditate on this - it's kind of like a deeper version of designing a game specifically to be hack-able, only now there are "tricks" to figure out, applications, as it were, for them system-mastery fans. Cool!<br/><i>[edit: major bonus points awarded for designing such a game in which combat is actually quite dangerous. Or is that a weird multi-(dis)incentive? At least you're not short on options if you're creative!]</i><br/><br/>Troy,<br/>I think a lot of story games that are "tight" (i.e. the premise is super-focused) can provide a lot of fodder also. Consider something like <i>My Life With Master</i>, or <i>Polaris </i>(both fairly constrained), on down to something like <i>Before We Sink</i> (my god, that's specific!). <br/>There were some neat experimental games back in the day that focused on this kind of thing - bonus points to anybody who can remember the game where you were an awkward white-collar office guy locked in a fallout shelter with the girl of his dreams, and the goal is to fumble and fail to get her to go out with you in your last few hours of existence. <br/>Vincent made an interesting observation about narration-rights once, when discussing Otherkind - he mentioned that, when people were excited about an in-game situation, everyone was too excited not to contribute! But, well, if your play procedures are really tight and deliberate (as opposed to just using narration-rights as a carrot), you might need to shoot them down, or at least insist that the Peanut Gallery funnel all suggestions through the appropriate contributor(s).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_302744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302744/#Comment_302744" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-30T21:30:27+00:00" title="November 30, 2010  9:30PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One trend I associate with "story-gaming" is the idea that people want a good story out of the game.<br/><br/>One trend I associate with "old-skool" is the GM concocting a good story and then shepherding players through it.<br/><br/>Perhaps there's some way to make use of this common ground?<br/><br/>Zac, I think your "many, many characters" idea has some potential there...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark" title="Captain_Thark"><img alt="Captain_Thark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/674/nQDB5F77NZR8N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark">Captain_Thark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302753/#Comment_302753" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-30T23:06:00+00:00" title="November 30, 2010 11:06PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I tend to associate "Old Skool" with the very interesting Old School revival style stuff. A lot of Old School (IE: Brown Box, AD&amp;D,) games were designed around the idea of players dealing with threats in ways other than direct conflict.

Here's a tricky point on which I almost got caught. You say "story-gaming", which is different, I believe, from "story now"? Did I read that correctly?<br/>May I ask you for a definition of what you mean by "story-gaming"?<br/><br/>For instance, if you mean the word as a synonym of "story now", then I should point that I don't focus on the story at all when I play story now. Because it only leads to dull fiction in the end. I only focus on character traits, especially what makes them vulnerable and what makes players get attached to them, react viscerally in conflicts, put something of themselves in their own characters, etc.<br/>Besides, in no story now game I own are there any rules that force <i>fiction</i> in any preset direction. They give instruments that let you create interesting characters each pursuing a definite theme. And that's what makes the story cool in the end.<br/>Focusing on the story is like trying to sleep by repeating to oneself "damn I need to sleep! I have to sleep! I have to sleep! I have to sleep!" to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302762">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302762/#Comment_302762" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-01T01:00:47+00:00" title="December  1, 2010  1:00AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>Epic GM plots.</blockquote>\nAre GM plots really "old school"?

I wasn't there so I can't say for sure but it also seems to me that old school puts an emphasis on situation (or rather, "locale") far in advance of plot. <br/>[Provided that we take "old school" for what OSR is saying about "what it was like" and looking at the old published modules (they're open ended locales with ingrained situations, not "adventure paths"). And provided we understand "plot" as "something the GM (and/or players) come up and play through - what is "supposed to happen", emulating, or rather making sure the game plays like some great series of fantasy novels.]<br/><br/>Good stuff in this thread.<br/><br/>What Zac and Levi are saying above is very close to what I was thinking about in my "imaginary space" thread (but never finished thinking about). OD&amp;D is fundamentally two things: a combat mechanic and an elaborate play pretend exercise.<br/><br/>The people who "got" the play pretend exercise were all about getting the treasure in clever wasy, with out-of-the box thinking and manipulation of the imaginary world (through the judgement of the GM/group) and avoiding combat (which was quite merciless). The people that were displeased with the combat (which is actually almost the only thing there were <i>hard rules</i>for) wanted more balanced combat, more tactical fiddly bits, more resources, more combos, more complexity, more "fairness" etc. becaue, hey, this game has rules for combat, what else are we supposed to do...this branch of evolution ultimately brings us to 4E.<br/><br/>Immersion is an iffy word. I'm extremely wary of it. Every person means something else by it. It's hard to talk about it.<br/><br/>Hit points...I don't really know what their specific merit is. They're a pacing mechanic, an abstraction. You can use them for anything. They're a tool.<br/><br/>Classes are making a comeback. I was pretty sure they were dead a few years ago, but obviously not. They're just getting redefined. Apocalypse World has a very traditional version of them, but some version of "templates" or "careers" never realy went away. Archetypes are useful. IT gives the player an immediate sense what their character is about or what they're capable of or what their role is. In more blunt "tv show"-type game the classes could be something like "the protagonist", "the love interest", "the sidekick" or whatever.<br/><br/>Modules we've got in some forms. Dogs towns, Storming villages, Lady Hackbird setups, Burning Wheel "adventure" situations (like The Sword). I bet ten different groups played The Sword ten different ways. I think we probably need more stuff like this. The problem is these situations are usually tailored to specific players and characters, are in fact built around characters, so pregens are sometimes a must.<br/><br/>Campaigns...this is something that I'm wondering about. What constitutes a "campaign"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302769/#Comment_302769" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-01T04:19:42+00:00" title="December  1, 2010  4:19AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The thing I'm enjoying the most in our Lamentations of the Flame Princess game is being woefully underpowered - a design spec in LotFP - and being forced to figure out ways to use our resources most effectively. <br/><br/>"If we can somehow get you on the back of the giant whale, you can cast Web down its blowhole and then we'll set the web on fire with a flaming arrow, which does continuing damage for two turns.

If my D&amp;D 4E power says "you leap high into the air and then..." but the mechanics don't actually allow you to "leap high into the air" I let the players do it anyway. Especially outside of combat. I don't like the idea that you can do these amazing things in combat but once weapons are put away all your specialness goes away to. I don't care if your diplomacy is -1, if you have an encounter power that rallies the troupes and inspires everyone around you, using that power outside of combat is going to mean something mechanically. <br/><br/>But it depends who I am playing with. If the group is very character centric, looking at the world only from their character's perspective, then the above usually works well. If the group is more strategy oriented and characters are more pawns with which they try to master the rules, then I won't mess with the rules.

For instance, if being damaged by a sentient/living/self-ambulatory entity initiates combat between the damager and the damagee, then knowing that "Telekinesis can move objects as fast as their falling speed" (and falling does damage) means that, while a pit trap may not initiate combat between the trap and its victim, using my telekinesis to slam you against a wall will most certainly start a fight.</blockquote>\nThat balancing act can easily be performed by a group, at the table, though.<br/><br/>One day I will drag you to a gaming table, and set in front of you a game by Clash Bowley.  And you will be confused, yea, and wonder why this game seems to be missing such stuff and has such an approach.

I wasn't there so I can't say for sure but it also seems to me that old school puts an emphasis on situation (or rather, "locale") far in advance of plot.<br/>[Provided that we take "old school" for what OSR is saying about "what it was like" and looking at the old published modules (they're open ended locales with ingrained situations, not "adventure paths"). And provided we understand "plot" as "something the GM (and/or players) come up and play through - what is "supposed to happen", emulating, or rather making sure the game plays like some great series of fantasy novels.]<br/></blockquote>\nIt's kinda both. D&amp;D very early on ( and other fantasy games emulating it) very often had early site based play with looting /exploration emphasis with occasional minor forays into other stuff.<br/><br/>Almost as soon as other non-D&amp;D genres were the subject of RPGs, plot event stuff started creeping in, sort of a preliminary to the later meaning of "story" in games. even old TSR modules for the non-D&amp;D games quickly had a go at trying to somehow emulate that stuff. I've certainly owned Boot Hill, Star Frontiers, and Gangbusters! modules that took a poke at working "story" in in some fashion.<br/><br/>As to this thread's main question ( sorta)-<br/>One of the notable concepts of Old Skool was, as noted, that a situation/locale was set up, and then the player could, through their characters, interact with it.<br/><br/>A more dirty hippie game concept is that the players, as players, can interact and define the imagined space. But it also tends to be that the players, as players, can create the situation/locale. Y'know, like a Fiasco playset or Oracles.<br/><br/>Hybridizing those concepts, what I would see is a set up where there is some sort of initial guiding hand; [ scenario/situation/locale] designer sets up the broad outlines of stuff, then opens it up for the players to start making the connections, not just through the agency of their characters, but also up on the player level.<br/><br/>Er, what?<br/><br/>Try to imagine taking something like an old White Wolf [City X] By Night book. Now imagine thaat every player has a copy or that you cut out all the pages and randomly shuffle and deal them out.  OKay, weird, right? But the concept is to give out some very cool starting concepts, put some sorts of boundaries on the situation, and then let folks run with it from there.<br/><br/>I haven't actually tried that with an old book like that, but I have tried it with minis+terrain which imply some sort of creatie beginning, and it has worked out really well on the whole.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_302828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302828/#Comment_302828" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-01T11:06:05+00:00" title="December  1, 2010 11:06AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>"Old-skool"</b> in the thread title was my lazy-ass way to say, "Techniques that predate the story games most of us are fmailiar with, and haven't shown up in many of those games."<br/><br/><b>"Story games"</b> in the thread title was meant to refer to indie stuff designed in the last 10ish years, some of which is Narrativism-supporting and some of which is merely focused on story-like elements.<br/><br/>For me, the question means, "What stuff that I did when I was 20 might I want to bring into the games I've played since turning 30?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302831/#Comment_302831" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-01T11:20:22+00:00" title="December  1, 2010 11:20AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>"If we can somehow get you on the back of the giant whale, you can cast Web down its blowhole and then we'll set the web on fire with a flaming arrow, which does continuing damage for two turns.

The players weren't willing to do that, despite the fact that the fun theorizing turned boring about an hour in.  If there's some OSR-style game out there that tells the group what to do in that situation, I haven't seen it.  Something like "GM, accompany tricky puzzles with some sort of time-pressure element" might be all that's required... I dunno...<br/><br/>I guess what it comes down to is that, in challenge-based play, engineering good challenges is vitally important and not that easy.  In an effort to calibrate difficulty optimally, a lot of games and GMs define challenges and solutions narrowly, and wind up ill-equipped to deal with impromptu whale-torching.<br/><br/>So, if I'm GMing, and I've got this puzzle door prepped, and the whale's just supposed to be an obstacle that forces the PCs to deal with the puzzle door... but then the PCs deal with the whale instead... how do I respond?  <br/><br/>A lot of GMs, I think, will instinctively go, "That doesn't work.  Now deal with the thing I prepped."  It's not an attempt to be mean, it's an attempt to stay safe and keep things under control and predictable.  The GM knows what will and won't work on the door.  He has no idea about the whale, and it's very hard for him to arbitrate that impartially (as challenge-based play demands).<br/><br/>I know you're familiar with my solutions to these issues in Delve, but Delve doesn't have these expectations about challenge.  If obstacles are too easy or too vague in Delve, the players won't feel gypped out of a good test.

Who cares. Maybe you come back later when you're smarter or more powerful or get a clever idea, maybe you don't. The door is there, it doesn't care, the DM doesn't care. This is very much the Western Marches way of playing. The world is uncaring, alive, independent, "real".<br/><br/>The second is functional "gamist" school, which dips into the first half of the old-school answer, but approaches it from a different angle. We're playing to win, so getting deeper into that dungeon is where the game is at. This also seems to me to be how Jason's group plays LotFP. There's this challenge and we're there to beat it. Doing other stuff is bullshit. The solution is to dictate to the DM/GM that they shouldn't plan for outcomes or solutions, only create challenges. It's about posing the question to the players: "What are you going to do about <i>this</i>, huh?" There's no puzzle with one (or even multiple) solutions, no pixelbitching or anything. Here's a threat, deal with it. If you do, congratulations, if you die, better luck next time, insert coin.<br/>There's also a degree of nebulous "good GMing" involved here, namely, making the judgement (often a game should have tools to help you with this) of what is dangerous enough or too dangerous or not dangerous enough for the party involved. That's why CR was invented. Storming helps here by not penalizing you for failing. You don't die, merely lose the fight, and you can come back later when you're stronger.<br/><br/>Both of these aproaches are viable and they're not mutually exclusive I think. It's entirely possible to use both. It's kinda how I'm planning my Pathfinder game these days.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302946/#Comment_302946" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-02T08:04:09+00:00" title="December  2, 2010  8:04AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Davis</cite>Levi, can you unpack your idea a bit more as to how it relates?

Neutrality is important in that context because, among other things, those old wargames were competitive affairs between the players ( generally).<br/><br/>They were also often the scenario creators and the determiners of victory achievement and victory conditions ( including judgment calls on non-obvious and partial or multiple victories).<br/><br/>Further, having a referee at all opened up a whole raft of possibilities for coloring outside of the lines in terms of rules interactions by the players, and refs were expected to be able to either wing rules, create them on the fly, or at least be willing to take some heat for Saying No.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302994/#Comment_302994" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-02T12:55:30+00:00" title="December  2, 2010 12:55PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, thanks for elaborating.

A lot of Old School (IE: Brown Box, AD&amp;D,) games were designed around the idea of players dealing with threats in ways other than direct conflict. It's been noted in at least a few places I've read that you were supposed to get most of your XP in D&amp;D from collecting treasure. Monster XP was kind of a bonus you got in the unlikely event you killed a monster.<br/><br/>And really, take a look at most of the older D&amp;D moduals, they're very open ended. Keep on the boarderlands is less of an 'adventure' and more of a detailed and explorable situation. <br/></blockquote>\n<blockquote>The people who "got" the play pretend exercise were all about getting the treasure in clever wasy, with out-of-the box thinking and manipulation of the imaginary world (through the judgement of the GM/group) and avoiding combat (which was quite merciless).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>"If we can somehow get you on the back of the giant whale, you can cast Web down its blowhole and then we'll set the web on fire with a flaming arrow, which does continuing damage for two turns. And hopefully the whale won't be able to breathe as its insides burn. Of course then you'll be on the back of a very pissed off giant whale..."</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Very quickly thrown-together instant characters, with little attachment from the player's side ("roll up a new character!"). In this type of old-school gaming, things like personality, etc, are emergent in play. You miss your first Dexterity roll and now you're known as "John the Clumsy", etc.</blockquote>\nWhy haven't you guys signed up for the MADcorp testing? <i>This sort of thing is exactly what I'm trying to do</i>, with fancy modern mechanics and some thematic elements built-in (predetermined thematics, in a kpfs-esque fashion).

Some conclusions, most of which are based on an in-person conversation on the topic with Lula recently:<br/><br/>-"Good" GMing is <i>primarily</i> about sensing and meeting the needs of the group (at more-or-less all levels of the Big Model, but the Social level may be primary in this regard)<br/><br/>-Therefore, learning to GM well is easier with mechanically simpler games\u2014how many people complain about not being able to simultaneously deal with the social needs of the group while also calculating to-hit bonuses and damage modifiers?  (This may be why truly old-school GMs actually did get pretty good training, since the oldest editions of D&amp;D were quite mechanically simple, if not in the same way, say, PTA is simple.<br/><br/>-Learning to GM well is also easier if the text makes it clear what you have to do\u2014and what you have to do is <i>not</i> "be a brilliant auteuristic creator of amazing works of staggering genius."  This is one of the major things Old-Skool gets right\u2014not that GMing is trivial or easy or anything, but it is more about being a neutral arbiter than a true <i>creative</i> leader.  Although creating the scenarios takes an enormous amount of skill and work.<br/><br/>-There's still no substitute for loads of experience\u2014but that experience is easier to come by in an environment where there's less pressure on GMs to really "perform" rather than simply facilitate, and may also be easier in games where one person doesn't GM the whole time!

I don't think we *ever* killed a thing, unless left with no choice (and mind you, going at  wild boar with nothing but a homemade spear felt so life threatening the guy who did was a HERO... who lost a leg). <br/><br/>I'd say, to me: old school was much more simulationist. We had rules for everything, even how much food was necessary to survive each day (one of our first game had everyone but one player die of hunger... we all still remember it fondly as a great moment). Nowadays, things are more streamlined and trying to be directly about some main theme of the game.(Interestingly, we had a discussion about Fiasco with my players recently, and they all thought it a bad idea of a game. Their argument can be summed up mainly thus: "Where is the fun in failing if you know from the start you're going to fail ?". They want their failures to be the product of their bad choices and fate going against them. The surprise element is integral part of the pleasure they get from "a good looser game".)<br/><br/>Anyway, things I kept from old school:<br/>a) modular rules. Rules can, and will vary from session to session of the same game. ("Today we'll just ignore the sustainment rules, that's not what we want to game about") <br/>b) character are functions. They're not here to *be* something, they're here to *do* something (may seem a silly point, I don't know).<br/>c) balance is not a necessity, whether we're talking character or team. Often it's not even desirable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_303805">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303805/#Comment_303805" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-09T12:47:38+00:00" title="December  9, 2010 12:47PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 10, 2010 6:39AM by Clinton.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite><br/>At one end of the spectrum:<br/><i>"Dave and Clinton are amazing GMs, spectacularly adept at sensing and meeting the needs of their groups moment to moment, something no one without staggering genius and years of experience could ever hope to achieve."</i><br/></blockquote>\nWell, yes, of course that is true. I did not invest 5 advancement points into "Classic DMing" for no good reason.<br/><br/>In seriousness, classic D&amp;D and its modern variants are obsessions of mine, and I spend a lot of time thinking about how to run these games in a satisfying manner so that players and DMs both have a good time. <br/><br/>The key is reading the game's tone well, explaining it clearly to the group to set up expectations, and then rolling with how they interpret that. I let everyone know up front that Lamentations of the Flame Princess Weird Fantasy Roleplaying (WFRPG) encouraged a harsh world with high occurrence of meaningless death, but rewarded ingenuity. The game posits that monsters are singular and that characters will encounter shit they cannot handle, at least not directly. That's been the key to success.<br/><br/>After that, I did the classic thing of setting up a location, not an adventure. I enclosed it for my own sanity: it's an isolated island they crashed on. Adding rival tribes of survivors, some ancient weirdness, deadly animal gods, and multiple ways off the island gave the players a set of choices I understood, and then I just started rolling with whatever happened.<br/><br/>As someone who plays a lot of games that distribute power off the GM, I did have to learn some techniques to run classic D&amp;D-style games well. The main thing is this: "railroading" and "illusionism" are terms to describe well-done and necessary GM techniques <em>done badly</em>.

We (I) don't want people going around saying illusionism and railroading are cool now. Although Kenneth Hite seems to be <a href="http://www.yog-sothoth.com/content/960-Investigative-Gaming-Seminar-at-Dragonmeet-2010" rel="nofollow">doing something like that</a>.<br/><br/>Giving the game direction is not a railroad. A railroad when you give the players a road and beat them with a stick when they try to leave it. "Hey, you need to kill this whale (but I don't care how you do it and there's the whole island left to explore." doesn't even come close to how I understand railroading. Same for illusionism. If there is a cave and you put a troll in it, yay, fun. Illusionism is when player decisions and dice rolls stop having any effect on what's happening and the GM is just giving you the feeling that you're achieving something while it's all going "according to plan".<br/><br/>I think those terms have a negative connotation for a reason and it should stay that way. Giving the game a direction, making on the fly decisions to make things interesting, reincorporating, tying things together, heck, even giving no other choice in some situations...it is all valid and useful in many games and contexts. But done bad is done bad.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>Oh, hey, and am I correct in thinking that LotFP didn't give you any specific tools or procedures to accomplish the good stuff you listed?<br/><br/>Helping GMs with that strikes me as really fertile unexplored design space!<br/><br/>I'd love a game that showed me how and why to:<br/>- clearly explain the game's tone to the group<br/>- set up expectations about what's most crucial, e.g.:<br/>- - rewarded behaviors (ingenuity)<br/>- - unavoidable risks (sudden death)<br/>- - encounter calibration (some stuff that's beyond you)<br/>- trap the PCs where your fun stuff lives<br/>- add fun stuff (e.g. rival tribes of survivors, ancient weirdness, deadly animal gods)<br/>- take control and give the game direction<br/>- watch what the players do and ensure that action is meaningful action<br/>- throw away your plan<br/>- make things you just made up feel real and solid</blockquote>\nThis is cool, can I try? I'm just running a game in the jungles of Chult.<br/>-to explain a game's tone I thought hard about things that we used to assume for years then spelt it out loud, I also thought about what the rules really support, and spelt it out loud, I considered my DMing style and spelt it out loud, I also injected some Creative Agenda-level statements...then I boiled it all down to one list of statements and gave it to my players<br/><br/>-It all flew directly into expectations: I told them where the game will take place, what will be the objective of the game (find the McGuffinn - you're playing to win), I told them about how I'm going to referee, that I'm not playing against but with them, but that I'm representing a wild and dangerous living world that's often beyond the power of their characters. I told them I would play fair and won't use tricks. Sometimes it has to be said out loud. I told them not to think about "what the DM expects you to do" but rather whatever is cool and makes sense.<br/><br/>-For "trapping" the PCs, I clearly determined the game will be taking place in Chult and that they're looking for an artifact on that continent. Going elsewhere and doing other stuff is jerk behaviour (in this game). A continent is bigger than an island, but it gave me the opportunity to draw a nice oldschool hex map. I also tweaked the distances considerably, making it about three times smaller that it is on the actual Forgotten Realms map.<br/><br/>-For fun stuff I scoured my pop culture memory of pulp and jungles. I browsed through the Forgotten Realms rumors and adventure hooks in the book and then threw everything together. There are at least five big factions (colonists, natives, jungle goblins, lizardmen, yuan-ti), many of them splintering into sub-groups (black snout, moon and red claw Lizardfolk tribes), with many side groups (wild dwarves, bullywugs, pteramen...). That should give a lot of rp options, politcking and trading etc. I threw in silly pulpy stuff like a King Kong rip-off, a zombie-based foresting enterprise, ancient temples and a spaceship. I tied it together with the possibility of a great darkness rising in the depths of the jungle (Shar/Dendrak the Night Serpent).<br/><br/>-all of the above, including prep allowed me to say "<i>This</i> is what we're playing." putting me in charge and giving the game direction.<br/><br/>-Now that I have some prep and a hex map, I'm going to use lots of techniques I learned from indie games to make sure the world looks "real" if fantastical and that things keep happening. I'll tie the PCs to the world, throw them clues (but won't care if they don't solve them), provide challenges (but won't provide solutions), etc.<br/><br/>-I have no plan, so there's nothing to throw away. Situations, locations, etc. Sure, I'll probably brainstorm all the time regarding "what's going to happen", but I have no plan as such.<br/><br/>-Real and solid: I'll give all the NPCs names, focus on atmosphere and descriptions, I'll refer to the characters, not the players, ask questions, give the NPCs motivations, have the world live and evolve independent of the players, make consequences of actions feel real (no meaningless or "empty" actions).<br/><br/>I really want to hear Clinton's thoughts on this                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_303862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/glazer" title="glazer"><img alt="glazer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/glazer">glazer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303862/#Comment_303862" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-10T00:58:58+00:00" title="December 10, 2010 12:58AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hello all,<br/>\n<br/>\nA quick intro, as this is my first post. I\u2019ve been role-playing for quite a while, starting out with \u2018white box\u2019 D&amp;D back in the 70s. I drifted out of the hobby in the eighties, and was lured back by, of all things, a review of Burning Empires (yes, I know, talk about diving in the deep end). This rekindled the fire, and led in turn to falling in love with what was going on in the indie roleplaying scene, and then the games coming out of through OSR as well. Please note the 'as well': I like both \u2018story games\u2019 and old school games, but I find they push different buttons for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a nutshell, I find story games very collaborative and \u2018fraternal\u2019 \u2013 I play with my friends, and between us we create great stories. Old school games feel very different, more immersive, and \u2018paternal\u2019 \u2013 allowing me to create an imagined space, and then invite my friends to explore it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, to cut to the chase, the thing I would import from old school games is that aspect of \u2018immersive world-building\u2019. A game where half the pleasure is in creating a setting in real depth \u2013 maps, NPCs, the whole kit and caboodle -  and the other half is in collaborating with friends to create great stories set in that space. The trick would be to allow \u2018both flowers to bloom\u2019, so that neither the creator\u2019s vision nor the players stories suffer. I know that a lot of story games are designed to allow play with minimum or no prep, but that\u2019s not a requirement, is it? <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing I would import is the slow development of a character\u2019s, erm, character. A lot of the mechanics used for story games establish the motivations and desires of character\u2019s at the start of play, and makes them crucial to game play right from the start too. There\u2019s nothing wrong with this, but I also like the way that in traditional rpgs these things are slowly teased out over the course of many sessions. When this works (and it often doesn\u2019t\u2019) I think it leads to really deep and complex characters, and also to characters whose motivations can end up surprising the person who has created them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doug%20Bonar" title="Doug Bonar"><img alt="Doug Bonar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doug%20Bonar">Doug Bonar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303864/#Comment_303864" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-10T03:36:49+00:00" title="December 10, 2010  3:36AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A guy I play with longs for the meaning that comes from a long campaign.  Both that the time allows people's brains to build connections between events, and that the shared past gives more meat for the role play itself.   In conversation with him, I'm realizing that some of the New Skool techniques are trying to short-cut what time was able to give in those Old Skool games he's longing for.  <br/><br/>Rather than finding what bits players are interested in by playing with them over time, we ask them to put up flags of some type.  Rather than mining a year of play history to be the back "conversation" for the most recent choice, we ask people to assume (and share) what they want to presume.  Which makes sense, we aren't in high school or college any more, we probably have less time to wait for involvement to build up slowly.<br/><br/>The two Old Skool techniques that I think we can't recreate though is time and inexperience.  We can try to build understanding and technique to get to the action faster (story now), but we can't really recreate the  "I've been playing _this_game_ for as long as I was able to play RPGs" feeling nor the wonder of the first time we ran into dinosaur riding goblins worshiping an alien computer from a crashed spaceship.  <br/><br/>Which isn't trying to be depressing.   Avoiding the tedious parts and working on recovering our sense of wonder though collaborative create are great!    I wonder whether time and first encounters were a bit part of old school though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_303869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303869/#Comment_303869" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-10T04:41:35+00:00" title="December 10, 2010  4:41AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In a traditional fame, if I hear the word "story" during play, or hear anyone using theory words I reach for my gun.<br/>\nPlayers imagine their being their characters, and the GM (to the player) is black box supplying sensory feedback.

However, while I agree about inexperience being something we can't recreate, I don't think the same is true about time. The time we commit to a game is a choice we make - we don't have less time these days compared to the seventies, just more things we can choose to do with the time we have. Personally, one of the great things about rediscovering old school games was the realisation that I could *choose* to spend time creating a game world, something I had loved doing when I was a teenager. So I made time for it, and you know what, it was time really well spent! I guess what I'm saying is that a story game based on the premise that it requires a lot of time from the players to make it work would be a worthy addition to the canon.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit: Okay, I

I think the key could be to communicate exactly when the players are in "make stuff up" mode and when they're in "find stuff out" mode.  Perhaps the group could agree on areas of mystery, which would be the exclusive province of the GM to determine; everything else would be fair game for all.  For example: anyone could make statements about world history, but only the GM could make statements about demons.  That'd reflect a group priority of the players wanting to discover demonic stuff and the GM wanting to provide that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303933/#Comment_303933" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-10T13:49:33+00:00" title="December 10, 2010  1:49PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 10, 2010 1:50PM by David_Berg.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Clinton</cite>It's a great little book.

What do the players do? What do the characters do? When designing my games I found myself trying to answer those questions.<br/><br/>Then came the realization that the GM is also a player, so there should be "What does the GM do?" and "What do the players do?" questions. <br/><br/>Then I started thinking in these terms about published games. What does the DM do? What does the Storyteller do? What does the Keeper do...these are all different GM jobs. Reading the Storming  the Wizard's Tower playtest was a big breakthrough, but I admit I didn't get it at first, what Vincent was getting at. <br/><br/>Then AW. AW was definitely the big "Well d'uh!" moment.

That said, among other things, I wasn't married when I was 12.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  And I do choose to spend non-gaming time with my wife.
