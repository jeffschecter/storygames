I have a couple players in my group that are convinced that dice are necessary for an RPG to be "fair" or "balanced", variously (which it is seems to vary from discussion to discussion), and are therefore blind to the fact that, as near as i can tell, the dice are spoiling their fun *way* more than they're contributing to their fun. So, for our run club i'd like to try something randomless on them, and see if they can see that, i suspect, they'd have more fun being able to choose their successes and failures, and that this can still be "balanced"--i.e., not necessarily lots of "i fail to make tea so i can succeed at slaying the dragon". <br/><br/>But i'm sorta blanking an games that actually fit the bill. I can only think of Amber, Theatrix, Nobilis, Marvel Universe, Mortal Coil, and maybe Universalis (i'm too lazy to go get it off teh shelf and check). Of those, i think Theatrix would feel too much like GM's fiat to these players, and Amber and Nobilis would feel too much like no rules to these players. What i'd love would be something with a crunch level approaching Ars Magica, or even Iron Heroes, but without a randomizer. Presumably resource-management, like Marvel Universe and Mortal Coil, but not necessarily. <br/><br/>So, what other randomless RPGs am i forgetting, and do you have any specific suggestions for players who like crunch, are mature enough to choose to fail important tasks at times, but would like to be able to choose which important tasks they fail at?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121532/#Comment_121532" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-23T13:07:58+00:00" title="January 23, 2008  1:07PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Universalis has lots of dice. 1001 Nights has dice, but they don't matter all that much.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I can't think of many published games that have lots of crunch but no dice.  I have an unfinished hack of Exalted that does something like this, but it's not really playable.  Marvel Universe is about the closest I can think of, honestly.  Nobilis can actually be pretty crunchy too, but it's all based on the same four stats, so it may not feel like it.  There's Polaris, which is generally diceless except when it isn't.

You could simply use the argument that whereas a string of actions in a crunchy, diceless game such as Chess actually matter to the crunch, dice play on gambles with measurable chance.  To some extent, being able to balance something akin to resource allocation with the chance of success one is comfortable with can be very fun.  But I think that many (especially popular) systems use a kind of system-illusionism here, which pads both good and bad decisions, reducing crunch to almost nil, and losing my interest.  Player decisions need to matter.<br/><br/>One issue with System is that players often have strong opinions on what they should decide for themselves and what should be left up to mechanics.  Where you draw this line defines the game in much the same way Stance (author vs. actor) does.  In this instance, your players may not feel comfortable, depending on the details alternate systems you've offered up (and honestly having much to do with the way you present them!), with their own decisions mattering more than a randomizer.  How do you get players to realize that this discomfort may be preventing them from enjoying good systems that see things another way?  Good question!  Since I don't know of any good examples on the market, I can't really point you in the right direction.<br/><br/>I actually started a <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=25532.0" rel="nofollow">forge thread</a> recently on a diceless, collaborative inner-conflict resolution mechanic, which is intended to add crunch in the grand scheme.  One particular point with this mechanic is that, aside from a table which aids in quantifying what the players are conflicted over, resolution at this level is left to the players, not the dice.  However, it has clearly delineated outcomes based on rules, which I think is a prerequisite for good crunch.  My problem (perhaps one that you're experiencing) is the absence of an existant RPG that already does a good job at this.  However, in the light of non-story games which have done a good job at diceless crunch, I'm sure that we can all agree that it's possible such an RPG does exist.<br/><br/>-JT                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Russell_Collins" title="Russell_Collins"><img alt="Russell_Collins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.clockworkaudio.net/images/russfacesmall.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Russell_Collins">Russell_Collins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121742/#Comment_121742" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-24T13:23:59+00:00" title="January 24, 2008  1:23PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh.

If it ends up at or below 0 you succeed, if not you fail, but you can pay your own tokens to move it closer to 0. 0 results give you perfect successes where you narrate what happens, results below 0 succeed but you don't narrate, but you do get more tokens for future attempts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123034/#Comment_123034" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-30T10:20:29+00:00" title="January 30, 2008 10:20AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What about <i>Everway</i>?
