I think it's because the GM's role, in "traditional" roleplaying, include a lot of different roles.  Quoting from a <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=22268.msg225956#msg225956" rel="nofollow">Forge thread</a> from 2006 a quick list posted as an example:<br/>----------------------------<br/><i>What sorts of leadership and authority are associated with this concept of "the GM"? Here's a quick rattling-off of what I've observed.<br/><br/>GMing as social organizer<br/>GMing as host<br/>GMing as rules-owner and introducer<br/>GMing as creative leader<br/>GMing as social/procedural leader<br/>GMing as player with specific authority<br/><br/>The interesting thing is that you can remove the illusory-centralizing concept of "GM" from all of these, and in doing so, a number of insights emerge. The first is that many of these can be disconnected from one another, i.e., don't have to be the same person. The second is that within any one of them, the role/function can shift from person to person without causing terrible traumas. The third is that that gaming terminology and traditions have fucked the whole thing up by nesting these functions in precisely backwards order.</i><br/>----------------------<br/>(the quote and list above was by Ron Edwards)<br/><br/>Without having to deal with social roles like "organizer", even if we stay on the gaming roles of the GM, we see that in "traditional" roleplaying he/she has to be (1) the referee (2) the adversity, (3) the creative leader, (4) the player of the NPCs (5) the "custodian of verisimilitude" (or "phisic engine of the world") and (6) the one who has to work before to prepare all the game need.<br/><br/>Seeing my history and my preferences as a GM, I have to say that I hate being (6), I love being (2) and (4), and I am somewhat resigned to be always (1) by default, even when I am not the GM, because I am the one the always study the rules... but I loathe being (3) and (5) when this mean "judge other people's contribution to the game" so much that I actively avoid being the GM in games where the GM has to fulfill that role (and I prefer instead games where that judgment and "realism" is distributed all around, like DiTV, PTA, Spione, etc.)<br/><br/>Quoting Vx:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>*To paraphrase Vx:<i>Your GM's agenda for the game is to make its world seem real and to create and play interesting challenges, without caring whether the opponents win or lose.

It feels like a real slippery slope towards "decide whether I want the player to succeed or fail", which is certainly possible with the amount of power Spirit of the Century gives the GM, but is not how I want to play.</blockquote>\nTo which I replied\n<blockquote>One of the main reasons I've shied away from Burning Wheel games is because my experience with "GM sets the difficulty" games is EXACTLY like what you describe with SotC. I was too keen on constantly having to set Obstacle values.<br/><br/>That to me is different than what Vincent describes as "+2 for the high ground." Either the player does or doesn't have the high ground based on the fiction. Sure there's still an aesthetic call to make but it's grounded in something concrete, unlike the vague descriptions of "easy", "hard", "challenging" etc. You run through all these internal conflicts like you describe.<br/><br/>Mouse Guard, on the other hand ... has a list of "factors" that are concrete fictional elements exactly like "has the high ground."[ for every skill ] So all you do is add up the factors and bam, Obstacle number. Sure you still have to make the call between "short distance" or "long distance" for the Pathfinder skill but that's a hell of a lot easier to see than the line between "easy" and "hard."</blockquote>\nFigured those thoughts might be relevant.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205453">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205453/#Comment_205453" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-05T15:49:04+00:00" title="May  5, 2009  3:49PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe it's a matter of ability, not permission.

I simply let the player roll, and after seeing if the roll was high or low, I decided what happened.  Why? Because it's much faster and easier.  If the roll is very low or very high you don't have to decide if the difficulty level is 13, 14 or 15: you think about it only if he rolls 13, 14 or 15, and not any other number.  If you roll a d20, and decide the target number before rolling, 17 times over 20 you are simply wasting your concentration and mental fatigue on something useless.  It's sloppy, wasteful design.<br/><br/>This cause illusionism, of course. This is state-of-the-art design for illusionism.<br/><br/>(I am convinced anyway that even the people who wrote these games didn't choose the number before: they simply didn't write the real procedures of play they used on the books)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_205457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205457/#Comment_205457" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-05T16:08:38+00:00" title="May  5, 2009  4:08PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's also true that a lot of mechanical systems quickly become complex enough that setting difficulties is not exactly a trivial exercise.

He rolls to hit!" seems fair, but "Someone attacks you unexpectedly! Roll damage!" doesn't.

We started roleplaying not knowing what it was and based it off Lucas Arts' games and later JRPGs. One thing we remember strongly is that through inconsitant world building on the GMs part you could sometimes get "bugs" which took the setting in an unexpected direction when the players started to use them. A freeform campaign that had gone on for a while got fucked up when I suddenly started basing the gold value on real life gold value in the medieval time but since -I- as a GM couldn't just change the setting all the old prices for swords and ships and stuff remained the same so two PCs sold all their adventuring gear and bought a war fleet and set off to conquer the demon continent. Also sheep were really fucking cheap so they filled the boat with them and used them to stop leaks/soak up water/food/pillows etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo basically, I can understand the fear of making one bad call that will ruin the immersion.

So don't attribute my manifold failings to any innate weakness, because I have none.  Graham:  Detroit is the American Stoke-on-Trent.<br/><br/>I will reiterate for the slow* that I love being the GM.  I will GM the hell out of some GMing.  I design games where everybody gets to be GM because I love it so much.  What I don't love is when the rules encourage the players to all turn to me, dew-eyed, and await my verdict on the range and concealment penalty for their MG-42.  Although I am completely capable of setting a sizzling target number (ask anybody), do that yourself and give me time to nail my German accent.  You will note a conspicuous absence of these rules from my games, because they are shameful and dumb (the rules, not my games).  The fact that, on a social level, we basically do the same thing all the time when handling the fiction is immaterial, because that is actually pretty cool and fun.  <br/><br/>In general I am also not a fan of illusionism, and I consider what I know of standard encounter design for, say, D&amp;D 4e to be just that.  I mean, it says right there that you are supposed to scale it up or down "based on the party".  What the fuck is that?  Hard but not <i>too </i>hard is what that is.  Perhaps this is not the issue at hand, but his frothing love for it does not endear John Harper to me either.  Guys playing D&amp;D:  Your die rolls don't matter.

I was running MG recently and, even though I had the table of Ob Levels right in front of me most of the time, I still found myself torn between setting Obs based on "real-world realism" (what happens in life) versus "fictional realism" (what happens in stories).  Setting arbitrarily low difficulty numbers is a braindamaged GM's way of "Saying Yes" traditionally, yeah?  I know it was for me.  That's what the stunting rules in Exalted et al are based on too, right?  If the group (or GM) likes what you're trying to do, the difficulty gets arbitrarily easier.  You wanna jump off the bullets and then punch the guy in his face with his own hand?  Awesome, roll a 5.  Why roll at all?  You're Saying Yes, but pretending you're still following the rules.<br><br>And that kind of thing gets all confused any time you have someone arbitrarily setting target numbers unless you're super, picture-perfect clear about how you should set them and why.  Even then, people bring their own baggage and set numbers for their own unfathomable reasons.  I know playing Mouse Guard that my Ob setting was anything but consistent and varied wildly from week to week.  Sometimes I was a hardass.  Sometimes I let players get away with murder.  And I feel like Luke is relatively clear in MG about how to set Obs.<br/><br/>What did work for MG (and what I'm planning on doing for whatever I run next, maybe 4E) is setting difficulties beforehand, when planning the game session, and then sticking to them as closely as possible, while still allowing the GM to adapt them on the fly, based on circumstances.  This means there's some there there.  You already picked a number and that's your default.  If you want to change it, you can, but at least you have something to start from that you've spent a few minutes thinking about instead of simply going with whatever whim you have.  There's a reason people don't invent D&amp;D monster stats on the fly, right?  Oh, let's see, he does 4d6+8 damage and has 135 HP and etc. etc.  That would work, sure, but it would probably suck (unless you've got some sorta crazy playstyle that's really digs that, in which case, maybe you should be playing something besides D&amp;D).                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_205538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205538/#Comment_205538" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-05T21:26:47+00:00" title="May  5, 2009  9:26PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>First of all, John, I grew up in Detroit, and my first bowl was the skull of another infant scraped clean with his father's best spoon, which I stole as he grieved his only child.

Asking yoursef "How difficult would it be for the typical person oin this campaign setting do succeed at that task?" is not the same as "The GM decides what will happen before dice are rolled", unless you're rolling for stuff as trivial as walking down staits, or as monumental as snuffing the sun. <br/><br/>Get a solid idea of what our benchmarks are, and you're good to go.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205553/#Comment_205553" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-06T02:12:22+00:00" title="May  6, 2009  2:12AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 6, 2009 2:13AM by Jesse.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: simjames</cite>"How difficult would it be for the typical person oin this campaign setting do succeed at that task?" <br/>...<br/>Get a solid idea of what our benchmarks are, and you're good to go.</blockquote>\nHere's the thing.

If the game provides at least the barest guideline for setting difficulties (even if it's just the easy/average/difficult rule of thumb), I'll give it a whirl when I'm GMing.  If it seems to work okay by my sense of things, meaning that characters typically succeed at things they are awesome at and fail at the things they are bad at, I'll probably keep doing it that way.  If it seems to not be working "right" for our game, then I'll mess with it until it does.  Frankly, when I'm GMing, setting target numbers seems refreshingly simple in comparison to all the other stuff I have to do.<br/><br/>I don't think I've ever been afraid of setting a target number, or thought that I should set the target number differently for particular characters, or felt like I was totally winging it when I had to set a target.  I suppose there must have been SOME moment when I honestly had no clue whether a task should be easy or difficult and I'm just not remembering it; I probably asked the players involved for more details or maybe even asked them "so...is that a hard thing to do?" and it either worked well enough that it didn't stick in my mind or was such an abominable failure that I've purged all memories of the resulting debacle from my brain.  Either way, it didn't turn me off to the whole thing.<br/><br/>Although I admit that I have at various times either asked people to explain the probability curve for wacky dice mechanics, and also sat around my apartment rolling various dice pools against various difficulties to get a feel for how it all works out in practice.  Maybe I actually am nervous about setting target numbers after all, and I compensate for that by burning some of my limited free time studying and practicing the system until I get over it?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205555/#Comment_205555" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-06T02:48:47+00:00" title="May  6, 2009  2:48AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I notice, also, that the people who have no problem setting difficulty numbers also tend to be tied to "realistic probabilities."  That is, if the situation were happening here, in reality, what chance would a given person under the given circumstances have of success?  But that's not how I measure difficulty.  In the games I like to play a character can be taking the exact same action, under the exact same circumstances and have wildly different chances of success given the broader *emotional* context of the situation as a whole.  If I'm setting difficulties then I'm the only one whose emotional investment counts.  I much prefer something that either takes into account the collective investment of the group OR externally aids in setting our collective investment.<br/><br/>A simple example is Dogs in the Vineyard.  The a narrated action backed with a Raise of 6 simply doesn't carry the same narrative weight as the *exact same action* narrated with a raise of 17.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_205556">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205556/#Comment_205556" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-06T03:24:00+00:00" title="May  6, 2009  3:24AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite>For some reason, a call on paper written by some bloke in Idontknowheristan has more authority than your best buddy who is sitting right there and who bought beer to the game.</blockquote>\nYour best <i>what</i>?

I see three positions, basically:<br/><br/>1.  Setting target numbers is just the GM exercising a type of authority.  It's part of the game and totally cool.<br/>2.  Setting target numbers is fucking weak, because (choose a reason)<br/>3.  Setting target numbers is not difficult, just follow the guidelines and do it.  I'm perplexed.<br/><br/>We're all correct, of course, and this is ultimately no big deal.  People in the second category will gravitate toward certain styles of play that make them happy.  People in the third category might end up in the first or second if they stopped to consider what they were doing, but that's entirely optional and possibly a bad idea.<br/><br/>This is a pretty focused point and not synonymous with straight-up GM fiat, as people in category one will capably demonstrate.  The thing that bothers me about it isn't judgment (I will judge you, trust me - I am judging you right now) as much as the way authority is distributed.  As GM I don't need to be the guy who decides that.  There are other things I do need to decide and I'd rather deal with those.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205565/#Comment_205565" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-06T05:04:47+00:00" title="May  6, 2009  5:04AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, would you have been less yellow-bellied if you were given some definite guidance?

Which is one reason I prefer focused designs these days.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_205579">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205579/#Comment_205579" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-06T06:55:50+00:00" title="May  6, 2009  6:55AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, I can't help but think this is about the GM not wanting to be judged, and be found wanting, and nothing else.<br/><br/>Which is kind of an interesting thought starter, actually...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205596/#Comment_205596" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-06T07:44:15+00:00" title="May  6, 2009  7:44AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've found myself feeling cowardly about setting difficulties in the past, in some games. A couple thoughts:<br/><br/>* Under the theory of "rules are there to introduce unexpected results," the GM isn't really setting the difficulty of a roll, is he? He's actually setting the likelihood of an unexpected outcome. Given the thesis is true (and I think it's got merit, at least sometimes), there's been very VERY little active discussion of best at-the-table practices from that perspective.<br/><br/>* The old task versus intent thing: In some games, the GM isn't really determining how <i>hard</i> something is, but rather how <i>important</i> something is. If you look at a game like Dogs or BW, the whole procedure starts with a decision gate regarding the very worthiness of the roll. So the decision isn't about fairness or referring to real-world probabilities, but about the GM's aesthetics.<br/><br/>So in both those cases, my thinking is that the scariness of GM judgment relates to the fact that event resolution within the game isn't what it looks like it is. It may be introducing the unknown (scary, even in a prenegotiated setup), or it may be the GM putting his aesthetics on display for the players (emotionally scary). And those are just the first couple that popped into my head.<br/><br/>I know I feel far less trepidation as a GM when I've been handed clear guidelines (like in MG) or when all resolution is the same (like in Dust Devils). That is, unless I'm running the game with a clear aesthetic vision and my hands are firmly on the controls, in which those kinds of games feel restrictive.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_205602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205602/#Comment_205602" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-06T08:06:21+00:00" title="May  6, 2009  8:06AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>...or it may be the GM putting his aesthetics on display for the players (emotionally scary).</blockquote>\nAnd now, roll that into the context of an open-ended ( or merely long-term) campaign.<br/><br/>Heh.

Most of the time, it will be a meaningless choice that only make you lose time.<br/><br/>Oh, it DOESN'T HAVE TO BE. Maybe the game system make use of that level anyway. For example, you say the level, and the Player can use the difference from his basic bonus to try more difficult things, or get other results. If there are, in the game system, OTHER subroutines that use that value, making it not meaningless anymore, it can work. And some games do.<br/><br/>But having to judge a number to roll above ONLY to know if the roll is above or below that number? It's stupid.

This is the long-term effect on play of this kind of design.<br/><br/>(I would argue that at the end, it's not all Drama. There is Karma, in the value written on the character's sheets. There is fortune, that is most important when you roll very high or very low. Drama only "push" the results a little up or down, when there is doubt.  It's demonstrable that playing these system this way is faster, easier, more satisfying for the players, and most people would consider "the way the better GM play". And it's illusionism.

If I'm setting difficulties then I'm the only one whose emotional investment counts.  I much prefer something that either takes into account the collective investment of the group OR externally aids in setting our collective investment.</blockquote>\nThat's interesting.  I tend to just handle the emotional context via bonuses/penalties.  It gets to the same place, only it makes it clear (in my mind, at least) that the reason why this task is easier or harder for character A than it is for character B has to do with the <i>characters</i> and not the task itself.  I get the "reality" of the setting AND the broad emotional context, and the overhead of assigning bonuses and penalties is not too bad.  (At least, it seems to cause me less grief than I've seen described here.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_205672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205672/#Comment_205672" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-06T11:07:26+00:00" title="May  6, 2009 11:07AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>At the end it will destroy your fun, but at the beginning, it's much, much easier and faster.<br/><br/>A good design is one where the easier and faster way is the good one, not the wrong one.</blockquote>It's good, even though it destroys your fun in the end?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205674/#Comment_205674" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-06T11:13:44+00:00" title="May  6, 2009 11:13AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>At the end it will destroy your fun, but at the beginning, it's much, much easier and faster.<br/><br/>A good design is one where the easier and faster way is the good one, not the wrong one.</blockquote>It's good, even though it destroys your fun in the end?<br/><br/>If it's good, it DOESN'T destroy your fun in the end.<br/><br/>As I said already three times, this is instead an example of BAD design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_205675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205675/#Comment_205675" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-06T11:14:45+00:00" title="May  6, 2009 11:14AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 6, 2009 11:16AM by komradebob.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>At the end it will destroy your fun, but at the beginning, it's much, much easier and faster.<br/><br/>A good design is one where the easier and faster way is the good one, not the wrong one.</blockquote>It's good, even though it destroys your fun in the end?<br/><br/>You know, like cotton-candy will make you sick if you eat too much, but man, it's great the first couple of bites.<br/><br/>Or something.<br/><br/>Actually, it rarely seems to ruin fun.

Not so much the sniping tennis match of the last few posts. But hey: Internet!<br/><br/>Four short plays about setting target numbers:<br/><br/>Matt: "How high is the wall again?"<br/>GM: "Oh, like 15 feet or so. Cinderblocks."<br/>Matt: "Oh. I just climb over it then. We're outta here."<br/>GM: "Okay... make your test at Ob 3."<br/>Matt: "3?! It's only a 15 ft. wall! With handholds. Easy."<br/>GM: "No it isn't. I tried to climb a 15 ft. wall once, and it was really hard."<br/>Matt: "Oh yeah? Well I can climb that wall in the pouring rain with a broken arm. Wanna see? Let's go find a wall. I'll show you..."<br/>(FADE TO BLACK OVER SOUNDS OF HOUR-LONG ARGUMENT)<br/><br/>-----<br/><br/>Matt: "How high is the wall again?"<br/>GM: "Oh, like 15 feet or so. Cinderblocks."<br/>Matt: "Oh. I just climb over it then. We're outta here."<br/>GM: "Okay... make your test at Ob 3."<br/>Matt: "3?! It's only a 15 ft. wall! With handholds. Easy."<br/>GM: "Oh, that's easy? Well, they wouldn't put an easy wall around the prison. How high would an Ob 3 wall be?"<br/>Matt: "Like, 25 ft. With no good handholds. And barbed wire on top."<br/>GM: "Yeesh. I'd hate to see the Ob 4 wall. Okay, it's like that, with the barbed wire and all. Ob 3."<br/><br/>-----<br/><br/>Matt: "How high is the wall again?"<br/>GM (smirking): "It's Ob 3 high."<br/>Matt: "Heh, cute. So... like 25 feet, with barbed wire and everything?"<br/>GM: "Yep. And the guards are still watching, from before. You want to make it over before they can blow a whistle?"<br/>Matt: "That would be nice."<br/>GM: "Ob 4, then."<br/>Matt: "Crap. If I hit Ob 3, I still make it over, just too slowly?"<br/>GM: "Yeah."<br/>Matt: "Hmmm. Risky. What we need here is a diversion, and some rope. Shannon? I think our characters need to talk..."<br/><br/>-----<br/><br/>Matt: "How do we know how high the prison wall is?"<br/>GM: "If you ask, I can tell you what's in my head. We can talk about what you imagined, if we're not on the same page. And someone is kind of in charge of that, as a buck-stopper kind of thing. Which in this game is technically me, but in practice we just talk about it."<br/>Matt: "But then, how do we know what that description means to you? Maybe you think a 15 ft. wall is hard to climb."<br/>GM: "I tell you a target number when you try to do something. Like 'Ob 3'. This is another way of saying 'The wall is a steep and treacherous thing to scale'. It's a concrete shorthand form of all the stuff in my head."<br/>Matt: "And we can talk about the target number, too? We don't have to just grumble about it and be all passive aggressive I guess."<br/>GM: "Right. All we do is talk. About everything. We're not enemies here. We both want the characters to face interesting and worthy challenges and have their beliefs tested and lose and win and suffer and dominate and all that. We don't have to get it right every single time, either. Lots of stuff will happen as we go. Sometimes a stupid wall will be too easy or too hard a thing but so what? We'll tune it as we go along."<br/><br/>(Plays not shown: The one where the target number is "Don't bother rolling. You make it over. Let's cut to the scene at the border crossing," and the one where the target number is "The wall is impossible to climb.")                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_205688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205688/#Comment_205688" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-06T12:01:27+00:00" title="May  6, 2009 12:01PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 6, 2009 12:22PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt: "How high is the wall again?"<br/>Dave: "It's a 15 foot high cinder block wall."<br/>Matt: "OK, what's the obstacle?"<br/>(Dave shoots Matt a menacing glare)<br/>Matt: "A 15 ft. wall!

They exist to help us come to agreement about the fiction. Rules that assign authority to one person are illusory. Authority as a thing is illusory. In the end, you might have authority as GM or player or whatever, but everyone else has to agree with you, or they'll get pissed.<br/><br/>When applying the rules-as-written starts pissing people off, player groups start hand-waving or house-ruling. Players are way smarter than designers think.<br/><br/>A good set of rules is designed as social lubricant, not a big fucking authority hammer. Designer: "How do I solve the problem of determining how hard it is for characters to do stuff, in a way that doesn't make players argue?" (and "players" here includes the GM).<br/><br/>Jason doesn't want to decide these things because <i>they're not interesting to him</i>. He's more interested in figuring out how to nail his German accent. <br/><br/>Traditionally, the GM decides these things. Why? Partly borne of fear that players will somehow "cheat" by letting themselves off too easy. More than that, though, players don't want to set their own difficulties. It's the Czege Principle, disguised. It's also wrapped up a bit in that nasty, thorny thing we call immersion. <br/><br/>In a lot of circles, when a player is in the headspace of her character, she doesn't want to stop and think about all the details that get in the way of her character's success. Of course, as soon as the GM says "Ob 5," this triggers the WTF alert in the player's head, and she's all over the GM. "Ob 5 for a 15' wall?!"<br/><br/>Jason's example, above, asks the player to think about the details and, in some sense, create her own adversity (Czege Principle violation). <br/><br/>Harper's first example demonstrates the failure of the system (I didn't say rules) to be a social lubricant for coming to consensus. <br/><br/>His fourth example is way too talky for my liking, but I understand that it's a first-time-only kind of thing. It would resolve back to his second or third example after a while. <br/><br/>Somewhere in those second and third example is functional play. People are agreeing through discussion and compromise. How much work are the rules doing to make that happen, though? The plays don't make that clear.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_205736">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205736/#Comment_205736" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-06T13:48:18+00:00" title="May  6, 2009  1:48PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 6, 2009 1:48PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Adam Dray, that's an interesting analysis.

Just one hair further and it stops being cool and starts being lame, but on the righteous side of that line is a lot of goodness.  I don't think my example crosses it, or at least wasn't intended to, but it is pretty situational.<br/><br/>(I think John's fourth example was intended to mock me)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205742/#Comment_205742" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-06T14:02:10+00:00" title="May  6, 2009  2:02PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I just realized that I'm being a Forge Twunt by talking about the <a href="http://random.average-bear.com/TheoryTopics/CzegePrinciple" rel="nofollow">Czege Principle</a> without defining what it means, though I suspect it's pretty clear from context. <br/><br/>"A principle named after author Paul Czege, roughly stating that if the same person generates the adversity and also its resolution in an RPG, the result is boring."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_205752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205752/#Comment_205752" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-06T14:35:46+00:00" title="May  6, 2009  2:35PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So...what about generating the potential for adversity, or a flavor of adversity, but not resolving it?<br/><br/>For example "Okay, Indy starts crosssing the rope bridge.
