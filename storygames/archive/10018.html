I've had to rebuild the manuscript from an old print-out after my computer died, and I've been taking the opportunity to endlessly tinker with... I mean, purposefully revise... the text as I go. I've also been working in some of the lessons I learned from all the playtest feedback I got last year. I'm satisfied that, aside from a couple of little tweaks here and there, the design itself is basically finished. I'm hoping to get the final ms ready for editing over the next few weeks. <br/><br/>The release of HQ2 hasn't affected anything on my end. I haven't read it, but I don't really like the sound of a lot of the changes they've made. I like augments and long lists of abilities dammit! I don't think that the criticisms people have been levelling at HQ2 really apply to my game. <br/><br/>Thanks,<br/><br/>Mark                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222338/#Comment_222338" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-03T23:55:52+00:00" title="August  3, 2009 11:55PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yep, the feedback that folks send Mark was pretty damn good, so I hope that ends up translating into some really good improvements.

That's why each supporting ability after the first only has a fairly small effect, it's why failure is always supposed to be interesting rather than nullifying, and it's why you earn a spotlight point whenever you lose a conflict. The idea was basically to create an environment where players aren't afraid of losing and therefore don't spend too much time trawling for bonuses. I recognise that that didn't fully work out, which is why some people's games (including mine) sometimes got a bit too bogged down or maths-intensive. I've since added a new rule which I think does finally address the problem - you can only use a maximum of 3 supporting abilities per conflict, although you can spend 1 SP to ignore that restriction for the current conflict (i.e. if it's so important to the character or the story that spending some extra time going through all the variables really is worthwhile). I'm just about to start 2 different playtest campaigns so I guess I'll find out if it works or not very shortly. <br/><br/>Mark                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224868">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224868/#Comment_224868" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-15T13:35:29+00:00" title="August 15, 2009  1:35PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've tried the 3-limit with a design of mine, Cranium Rats, what a playtester pointed out was, "Well, I'll just keep looking till I find three."<br/><br/>It was a bit more complicated in my case, cause the players had to narrate what gave them the advantage, rather than look it up on the sheet, and the GM had to decide whether or not it flew.<br/><br/>But still, some players will look up for all three, and will be unwilling to move on before they do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soviet" title="soviet"><img alt="soviet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/715/nBVUFTQIKLVIT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soviet">soviet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224871/#Comment_224871" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-15T14:07:46+00:00" title="August 15, 2009  2:07PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thunder_God</cite>I've tried the 3-limit with a design of mine, Cranium Rats, what a playtester pointed out was, "Well, I'll just keep looking till I find three."<br/><br/>It was a bit more complicated in my case, cause the players had to narrate what gave them the advantage, rather than look it up on the sheet, and the GM had to decide whether or not it flew.<br/><br/>But still, some players will look up for all three, and will be unwilling to move on before they do.</blockquote>\nYeah, exactly. As soon as you say the limit is 3, you also sort of say the minimum is 3. But I'm not too worried, because honestly most characters in Other Worlds should be able to find 3 supporting abilities pretty easily.

On the one hand it acts as a general limitation to enforce a certain amount of mandatory discretion. But on the other hand it also trusts players to identify those truly story-significant conflicts on their own, and then gives them explicit permission to really go to town with their descriptions without feeling like they are doing something dodgy. They paid for it, so it's OK. <br/><br/>The only alternative would be for the GM to judge each conflict for 'story-worthiness' and that's just a whole can of worms I really want to avoid. Trusting players is good IMO.<br/><br/>It does potentially change the spotlight point economy though, in terms of the effectiveness of buying new abilities and supporting characters. I might have to look at some of the costs again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227351/#Comment_227351" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T15:40:15+00:00" title="August 24, 2009  3:40PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, you can change the perspective.<br/><br/>It's not the GM deciding what's important to "The Story", but the player deciding what is important either for him as the player, or for their character. The GM can look at it as a Flag.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227353">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soviet" title="soviet"><img alt="soviet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/715/nBVUFTQIKLVIT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soviet">soviet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227353/#Comment_227353" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T15:53:38+00:00" title="August 24, 2009  3:53PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yep, that's exactly it.
