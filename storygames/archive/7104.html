It was at Macklon and we all had a good time. There was discussion of the oracles falling a bit flat, though. There simply wasn't enough interesting hooks or characters to latch on to. We really had to stretch and pull teeth to get something to work with. I probably should've just added another oracle or gotten new ones, but I wanted to force it through. Don't know why really, I guess I wanted to test the oracle quality.<br/><br/>ANYWAY, I was thinking of an interesting way of doing oracles and I'm wondering if it would work. Oracle creation is one of the big stalling points I've hit with my Batman hack, and now I see how important it is to make them strong, interesting, and full of hooks and potential conflict. <br/><br/>So my idea is to have each player bring a single comic issue to the game session. Any comic really. There are plenty of cheap 25 cent comics out there in bargain bins, and it would give people a good excuse to walk into your local comic shop. I'm thinking that each player (gm too) would roll a die to get a random page on the comic and simply pick an oracle from some line of text or hell even a panel. Here's why I think this would be cool:<br/><br/>-The comic would get people in the mood and ensure that they at least know what the source material is like.<br/>-Since each person is choosing their comic to bring, they are having some say in the setting creation.<br/>-It fits the theme of course.<br/>-I don't have to come up with oracles myself. (I'm the lazy designer/gm)<br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_158015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158015/#Comment_158015" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-22T22:14:13+00:00" title="July 22, 2008 10:14PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse, you do then get the potential that sucky panels get picked, or that you have 6 close-up face shots.<br/><br/>Two alternates:<br/><br/>Before showing up, each player picks their three favourite panels from a comic book, and cuts them out. Mix up all the cut-outs at the beginning of the session, and draw X.<br/><br/>Before showing up, each player picks a panel depicting: a hero, a bad guy, a location and a dilemma. Cut out the four panels before showing up to the session, as above. Have all the players assemble their hero panel, and in a separate pile their bad guy panel, and so on.... Draw one panel from each pile, and have this be the oracle. Alternately, draw 2 from the hero, 1 from bad guy, 1 from location, and 2 from dilemma. Whatever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_158094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158094/#Comment_158094" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-23T08:54:30+00:00" title="July 23, 2008  8:54AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One point I'd add: there's a chance you'll end up in the same situation we've talked about RE the Batman: unique character depictions "feel" like they are going to force particular characters; whereas a "good" Oracle should only *suggest* characters, leaving specifics up to the player(s) who choose to make them. In other words, I think a proper Oracle is a mix of evocative imagery and vagueness--comics got the former (usually; some more than others) but are diametrically opposed to the latter (because of clear, obvious visual depictions).<br/><br/>Also, I'd watch out for Oracles that write the plot in advance--something a series of panels might trick you into doing before you're even playing. "Pregnant situation" is the goal, with Oracles....<br/><br/>HTH;<br/>David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_158382">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158382/#Comment_158382" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-24T10:17:27+00:00" title="July 24, 2008 10:17AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good points. I guess I'd like something that doesn't feels more organic than separating the panels into piles, but I'm sure that would work better. The more I think about it, the more I realize that the original IAWA text IS worth the money simply for the quality oracles it contains.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
