It sucked not getting chosen yet you sometimes got chosen when not ready. Then one of the two being rewarded and selected was also a feelbad moment. I get that this system rewards good story ideas in a competitive way (akin to Laws\u2019 <cite>Narrative Cage Match</cite> concept) but sometimes you\u2019re chosen / not chosen for meta reasons.<br/><br/>\u2022 A lot of times people just came up with kind of lame stuff like \u201cEh... I collect phone booths! On the moon!\u201d and/or pretty much copied each others stories straight up, changing like one word.<br/><br/>\u2022 As the night went on, everyone was slower and slower. It was a lot more silent pauses when you got chosen, more umming and awing, more \u201cUh, wait, I wasn\u2019t paying attention, what was the last thing someone said?\u201d. Since we humans more easily perceive other\u2019s slowness than our own, I could only see them being slower and not me (still don\u2019t know if I was slow or not), and since they were drunk and I was sober, I started blaming that. Like \u201cThis is so boring because these guys are so drunk and slow, too bad because they were creative in the beginning of the evening\u201d. That kind of thoughts. That\u2019s nothing that can be blamed on the game or the game\u2019s designer. (The reason I'm bringing it up, though, is that the "one at a time"-non-interactivity of the game amplified the situation a lot.)<br/><br/>\u2022 Reading the book, it\u2019s beautiful and well written, with many ways to learn the (pretty complex) system. Short summaries, detailed walkthroughs, many examples.<br/><br/>\u2022 Many games (including my beloved D&amp;D 5e) deal with mental illness in a pretty disrespectful way. This seems to do it gently and with respect as far as I could see. (Caveat: one person saying \u201cIt is OK\u201d, like I just now am saying, is not a counter-argument to someone else saying \u201cI was hurt\u201d. I\u2019m just saying that it seemed OK as far as I could see on reading through it quickly.)<br/><br/>So what were the stories:<br/><br/>\u2022 A rich kid coping with an adulterous father by going pearl diving in the caribbean<br/>\u2022 A disabled woman taking her revenge on a corporation that exploits the vulnerable<br/>\u2022 A thief getting into increasing debt with lone sharks as he was financing a risky hobby<br/>\u2022 A gangster\u2019s daughter dying on her quinceanera<br/>\u2022 An old man deciding to become a bank robber and accidentally killing his best friend\u2019s daughter<br/><br/>Pretty interesting stuff \u2014 all four of those could be developed further into an interesting short story, perhaps \u2014 but we wrapped it up after the second memory (and four long boring hours).<br/><br/>Sorry if this post is more review:y than AP:y. Just wanted to get it off my chest.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441010/#Comment_441010" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-23T14:45:08+00:00" title="December 23, 2014  2:45PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Every person you add to a Penny game makes it geometrically longer - five people does indeed create a slow game.

As more pennies tend to make for longer journeys, I treat getting a penny as a disincentive. I find that when two people are giving responses intended not to be chosen it gives a different dynamic.<br/><br/>Stuff like phone booths on the moon sounds like they were ignoring the play advice in the basic setup that everyone is an ordinary person. <br/><br/>Penny's immersive rulebook is a two-edged sword. An experienced player remarked to me that participants fared better when they understood the reasons for particular aspects of the design rather than remaining totally in universe.<br/><br/>Penny is a quiet game and you do need to concentrate because you're trying to keep everyone's separate stories in your head and you can be called on at any time. I personally find it only gets slow when players forget that they shouldn't be stating what they did and other players forget to challenge them. I've seen a player repeatedly struggle to continue their journey and yet repeatedly forget to ask as to what they did or said next. They made their journeys far more difficult for themselves by not focusing on giving away pennies. I've played it three times now and I've probably done it as well, but in my last game I went through an eight penny journey in less than 10 minutes. It sounds like you were right, though, to call it where you did. The last round is about half the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441027">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441027/#Comment_441027" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-24T08:37:41+00:00" title="December 24, 2014  8:37AM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Having a long journey with many decision points (pennies) is good.

If I was not trying to be chosen - perhaps by suggesting something obvious or by placing the character in a harder situation than the alternative - then it wouldn't make me feel bad if I wasn't chosen. <br/><br/>I may still be chosen anyway. Sometimes what is obvious to me is inspiring to the other person. Sometimes it's not, but they want to take the obvious choice because they find it easier to incorporate into their journey.  Sometimes a player may choose a harder situation as they find it helps them define their character more. I feel that quality is subjective. I cannot predict or control what the other player will find inspiring or not, but so long as I am providing a choice I am fulfilling my role in the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441070/#Comment_441070" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-29T21:44:15+00:00" title="December 29, 2014  9:44PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ke'u<br/>It seems to me that deliberately crafting choices with the goal that they not be chosen is not the intent behind the design because that seems like it would dilute or lowel the quality of the narrative.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441104/#Comment_441104" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-01T02:12:18+00:00" title="January  1, 2015  2:12AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right - if you do offer something silly in a relentlessly dramatic game, it can give a character an un-satisfying "out", letting them bypass prior hard decisions altogether.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441120">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard" title="EpistolaryRichard"><img alt="EpistolaryRichard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard">EpistolaryRichard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441120/#Comment_441120" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-01T21:58:30+00:00" title="January  1, 2015  9:58PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 1, 2015 9:59PM by EpistolaryRichard.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As I say, I feel that quality - in regards a story - is subjective. I don't feel that it's for me to judge what is a higher or lower quality option; I feel it's down to the other player, who may well see things very differently. The key aspect for me is that I am not invested in the option I present, and I don't usually experience a feelbad moment when another option is picked.<br/><br/>As to silly options, again YMMV. I can only speak from my own experience, but what sounds silly to one person could mean something very different to the other. This is a section from my account of my last game:<br/><br/>"Penny constantly impresses me with how quickly you can go from a blank sheet of paper to being able to narrate a scene about your character. Perhaps suprisingly, it is often silly questions that prove the most helpful in defining your character. The first guiding question to me was 'Did your older brother try to steal your birthday cake?' - okay, a bit of an inkling there - and the second 'Was it your thirtieth birthday?' - BAM, character, situation, right there. And those two questions alone pretty much carried me through the rest of the game. The player asking it laughed it off, thinking that he was being absurd and silly and was going to take it back, but I stuck to it. It was far more useful to me than something like 'Did you get a bike for a present?' that would have continued with the premise that I was a child."<br/><br/>As to providing an 'out', the journeying player always has the choice. I'm personally not that comfortable in Penny with trying to block a player into having to make a hard decision they don't want to make. If they want to go somewhere then they'll go there, but if they're looking to bypass something then I'm okay with doing that. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441127/#Comment_441127" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-02T07:01:27+00:00" title="January  2, 2015  7:01AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In that case I misunderstood what you were saying.
