For instance, the Diceconomy games (<i>Runeblade</i>, <i>Vector</i>, and <i>Doublecross</i>, at the moment) are three variations on a central mechanic and theme: three players/characters who need each other to accomplish their goals and yet are in tense or antagonistic relationship to one another, which is represented by holding, sharing, offering, and taking dice of different colors as control of the narrative shifts. I recently put up <i>I\xe4: A Game of Dark Worship</i>, created as an entry for Ryan Macklin's recent flash design contest, and which I hope to revisit and expand: it puts you in the position of a cultist of Them, working to bring about the conditions for Their blasphemous return to the world. A couple of other small projects should also be debuting there in the next month or two.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for long-form physical work, I'm in the final layout and edition for <i>House of Cards</i>, which you can follow at houseofcardsrpg.wordpress.com. House of Cards is a modern fantasy game in the lineage from George MacDonald, Winsor McCay, Lewis Carroll, up to Gaiman's <i>Neverwhere</i> or Nobilis. Dreams are just a parallel world to ours which exists on the other side of mirrors, but something has upset the balance, leading to creatures from the other side preying upon mortal dreamers to steal their energy. The characters are Bearers of one of the Major Arcana of the Tarot, tasked with battling these threats, while exploring the wonders of an infinite realm of magic just a step away from our physical realm. As I said, it's on the verge of completion: the last bits of the art will be in this month, and it'll go to the printers ASAP when that happens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
