I love DL. But, the rules specifically forbid slavery, racial tensions, and Indian genocide as topics...an eye-rollingly pitiful cop-out when the games are played on a backdrop of the civil war, asian miners, and indian shaman. White Wolf doesn't seem to have that problem--there's a supplement on the holocaust and in werewolf they mentioned unhappy Indians.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo yeah.<br/>\n1) Controversial topics that come up in-game.

When I was working on Classroom Deathmatch, and immediatly afterward when the VT shooting happened, I had a lot of peole tell me that a game about students murdering each other was in really bad taste, and that I shouldn't publish the game in light of tragedies like the VT shootings. But I think that's the wrong way to think about it. One of the primary responsibilities of art, even the kind of art we practice as designers and players, is to examine difficult subjects and to explore hard to understand topics. I feel like the very best role playing comes when players put themselves in difficult situations and force themselves to ask tough questions and make hard choices. Using a game to examine  difficult subjects like school violence, betrayle and murder (to use Classroom Deathmatch as an example) is far preferable to pretending like these subjects don't exsist. Instead, we can understand these subjects betetr through exploration via imagination.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn games I play I always try to examine and confront subjects that I find difficult or controversial. By putting myself in alien or uncomfortable situations I can explore points of view that I hadn't considered before and try new things that I otherwise might not try. This is less role playing as wish-fullfillment and more role playing as exploration, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Yes. Those are the games I prefer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/asdfff" title="asdfff"><img alt="asdfff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/asdfff">asdfff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91511/#Comment_91511" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T01:32:45+00:00" title="August 30, 2007  1:32AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 30, 2007 1:33AM by asdfff.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jake richmond</cite>immediatly afterward when the VT shooting happened, I had a lot of peole tell me that a game about students murdering each other was in really bad taste</blockquote>\nAFTER the release, how many people told you that it was in bad taste because of temporal proximity to the VT shootings?

Bring it on. I really enjoy playing controversial, dark themed games. I like historical games. I read more non-fiction than I do fiction anyway.<br/><br/> It also depends on the group of people. I like and trust the people I play with, and I'm comfortable with my own threshholds to be able to articulate when I don't feel safe or comfortable with the course of action. <br/><br/><a href="http://www.stone-baby.com" rel="nofollow">This is the first game I've ever designed.</a> I didn't set out to write a "controversial" game. Steal Away Jordan didn't start out as a game about slavery. I set out to design a game with an interesting premise, that would tell a compelling story. When I took it to GenCon I was a little surprised (albeit pleasantly) that my game caused discomfort. Several times people mentioned discomfort as white people portraying black slaves. My pat answer has become, "well, I play white characters sometimes". There's more to it than that, really. I think it's a good thing for people to play outside their comfort level.<br/><br/>My game's not about relieving or causing guilt about being who you are. Slave narratives are interesting to me, and one race's history is really everyone's history, and should be appreciated and embraced as such. If you learn something about yourself or other people in playing a game with a difficult historical theme, that's a bonus, but not necessarily my intention.<br/><br/>2. Not only would I play a game, I'd write another one like it. I look forward to playing Grey Ranks, and Carry, and even not being the GM in my own game one of these days.

I know that for me and the groups I play with regularly it creates really interesting games. When I push myself in a new direction I get unexpected results. I say and do things that I wouldn't normally do. I'm forced to look at issues, both familiar and new in different ways. It's very exciting.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things that I've discovered over the years is that if I have the option to build a character for a game, I will invariably build a character that represents an aspect of myself that I am comfortable with. And this will often be the same character that I played in a previous game, with a different name and set of physical features. But still the same character. With the same approaches to solving problems and the same moral compass. If I take this option away from myself, if I play a game where I don't get to create a character (Classroom Deathmatch for example) or a use random modifier's to create a character, I end up with something new and unexpected. I end up going in unpredictable directions. I find it really interesting and really rewarding.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeyond that, conflict builds character. Addressing a difficult theme or subject often creates tension and conflict between both the characters and the players. I like that. I like to argue and disagree. Again, it takes games in interesting directions, and lets me and my fellow players explore ideas and emotions that we might not otherwise get to see in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nJake                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91641/#Comment_91641" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T08:55:48+00:00" title="August 30, 2007  8:55AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh...can I just draw a distinction?<br/><br/>Dark, psychological things in play: GOOD<br/>Challenging play: GOOD<br/>"Issues" like slavery, sexism, abortion in play: BAD<br/>Depressing stuff: BAD<br/>Games which encourage dark stuff: GOOD<br/>Games which encourage challenging play: GOOD<br/>Games about a single issue: BAD<br/><br/>...where good and bad is "in my opinion".<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray" title="James McMurray"><img alt="James McMurray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray">James McMurray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91645/#Comment_91645" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T08:59:07+00:00" title="August 30, 2007  8:59AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What if you're encouraging darkly and challengingly psychological stuff about a society that enforces female slavery and abortion?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91649">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91649/#Comment_91649" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T09:05:11+00:00" title="August 30, 2007  9:05AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jake: Novelty, gotcha.

Last time we got together, subject matter included white supremacists, Abu Ghraib, that pizza-delivery guy who got wired to a bomb and blew up on the side of the road, gay marriage, treason, and castration.<br/><br/>I don't even know that we consider this stuff to be controversial, seeing as how we all laugh as it's introduced into the game. I'm sure that there are a few topics that would give everyone pause (for example, the abuse of children), but then, that wouldn't really be in character for my gaming group. We all like to laugh and have fun, and that's the kind of subject matter that it's really hard to crack a joke about. At least, for us.<br/><br/>Everyone's got a different standard. I believe that you really have to laugh, or else the sheer filth and misery of life will drag you down into the toilet bowl of introspection and flush you into despondency. But other people get really agitated about some of the things that I find amusing.

Sure, most people go to the movies to be entertained, but sometimes it's good (in the way Jake described) to see a movie that makes you uncomfortable. <br/><br/>Lisa and I watched Blood Diamond recently, as part of our "Africa Series" of movies. It's entertaining in a lot of ways. But it also deals with child soldiers, exploitation, warmongering, foreign interests in Africa, and so on. It's much more powerful than I expected. And while I wasn't a big fan of diamonds before, I'm definitely not going to buy any now. It's good for me, because it enlightened me about an issue. It didn't do so by preaching or being an issue-only documentary (though bits and pieces of dialogue were a bit preachy), but by being a mostly-entertaining dramatic movie with the undercurrent of these issues.<br/><br/>I often want the same from my games. Drama, depth, and if possible, dealing with difficult issues that help me grow as a person.<br/><br/>Now the next movie in our series is Hotel Rwanda, and we've been putting that off for a while because it's much more uncomfortable.

Role playing is already used as a tool to help people comfortably and safely sort through issues, to illustrate potential conflicts, and to do these two things in a safe, engaging manner.  <br/><br/>When I was in nursing school we did lots of role-playing, especially in psych nursing. One of the ways you help recovering addicts learn to use new healthier coping strategies is to have them act out situations where they'll need them. One of the ways we as nurses learned to talk to patients effectively was to role play.<br/><br/>When I worked in human resources we used role playing to illustrate to employees how the other person might feel if you say or do something that could be considered harrassment. These role playing games were often engaging, sometimes sad, and many often times a pretty fun, because people got to play issues in an over-the-top manner.<br/><br/>So that's work. Back to your friends sitting around a table with drinks and chips. So where can this be fun with your chums? Well, do you watch scary movies with people? Do you ride roller coasters? Do you tell dirty jokes? Did you ever tell ghost stories around the campfire?  <br/><br/>I think the fun in playing the bad things in life comes from our tendency to say "what if this really fucked up thing happened to me? Would I freak out or get bad ass? I want to see what would happen! I want to be bad ass in the face of fucked up!"

Or that force them to do these things, or to see these things.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most horrible mind-numbing bad example of this kind of "playing issues" in my experience wasn't with a some experimental forgey game, but was with D&amp;D.; To "motivate" a new female player the DM (with very good intenction and motives, I can assure you) narrated the rape of her player character (in a flashback from a period before the start of the campaign), in details. Reading from a written text he had prepared.  For at least a couple of minutes. Unbearable.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I believe that a lot of people think about something like this when they hear about "controversial topics" in a gdr. And they are repulsed. And I understand them. I was repulsed by that DM action, and I would be repulsed by the offer to play D&amp;D; or any "traditional" simulative game with any of these topics forced upon me by the GM.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat THEY don't understand, it's the way these "thematic games" are REALLY played.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's not that there are no limits anymore. There always are limits. But they are completely different, and not just in intensity. It's not anymore "what you enjoy being subjected to with very little control over it", but it become "if you wanted to write a story, that mean something to you and it's not pure entertainment, there are topics that you still would avoid?"<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's possible that there are things that, by the other hand, you would enjoy having in a D&amp;D; (or some other "traditional" game) because you would not have the responsability of bringing it to the table, and you would not like to have them in a thematic game. It's not a question of "intensity", it's really a completely different beast.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91754/#Comment_91754" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T11:29:10+00:00" title="August 30, 2007 11:29AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Forced" is a non-issue.

My ideas about religion have been clarified in my mind through my play of Heroqest, believe it or not<br>\n<br>\nI can go on and on. Do RPGs have to do all of these things? No, of course not, and they're great as light entertainment. But I think that even asking if they "can" do these things is ludicrous. They can, and they should, to the extent that this is the designers' goal. Bob, if you write a good game about something like this, somebody will play it. No, not everyone will want what you're providing, but if that's your criteria for whether or not to write a RPG, you can just quit now. No game is for everybody. Make the game you think is of the most value. <br>\n<br>\nAre there "dangers" here? Well, sure, like with anything you do that's challenging or potentially theraputic.

Although maybe someone did. Rather, I know what I'm saying is that one of the things I really find worthwhile and enjoy is pushing myself in new ways by putting myself in situations that I normally wouldn't. Sometimes this is as simple as playing a female character instead of a male character. Sometimes, like in the Perfect game I played at Go Play NW, this involves stuff like love, betrayal, sexuality, emotional catharsis and brutality. <br/><br/>But what works for me may not work for someone else.

Is that a judgment you bring as a consumer?  I think there's a big gap between "that game's outside my comfort zone" and "that game's sole objective is to be outside my comfort zone."  But playing for entertainment - I can get behind that, and my earlier comment about a semantic divide seems relevant.  Like playing carry - do you have "fun"?  Is it "entertaining"?  In a way, I guess, but I almost feel guilty saying it.  While carry is dark and maybe controversial and way, way outside some people's comfort zones, it serves goals outside those things very well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GMSkarka" title="GMSkarka"><img alt="GMSkarka" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v385/GMSkarka/tinyadamant.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GMSkarka">GMSkarka</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91780/#Comment_91780" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T11:52:10+00:00" title="August 30, 2007 11:52AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 30, 2007 11:52AM by GMSkarka.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite><br/>I've never seen a game that positioned itself this way, myself. </blockquote>\nFrom the blurb for <b>Steal Away Jordan</b>:<br/><br/><i>"players explore the social and psychological implications of life in a society where people can be property.

I think FATAL is crap because it doesn't have any redeeming qualities at all in terms of subject matter and how it wants you to address the subject matter.

Based on free speech, I'd say you have a right to produce such a game, but I can't in any way, shape, or form actually advocate such. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf it's dark, the goal has to be to contemplate the nature of evil or something... not to revel in it. I don't like the nature of Paul's game Acts of Evil, but I understand how play isn't in fact, just reveling in evil. And if you can't see how Kill Puppies for Satan is, in fact, a parody of evil, then... Well, you can see the potentially redeeming qualities here. <br/>\n<br/>\nOther than this sort of line, I think that the seriousness or "drepressingness" of a subject, or the angle by which it's approached, and how this affects your desire to play, is a pretty darn subjective thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

I love debating politics and religion and social issues. But controversy for controversy sake I'll avoid.  Two great games that skirt this line both came up at GenCon. Both were about "victims" in terrible situations.<br/><br/>Poland in 1944 seems like it would be nothing but controversy.  But playing teens in the uprising also has a lot of potential for optimism, and even the question of "what would you give up?"  It's a kind of grisly hope that I'm really drawn to, the core of most of our stories. The game usually plays out as a tragedy, though, but it begins from a place of hope.<br/><br/>Then there's Steal Away Jordan. And slavery is so dehumanizing and cruel that immersing myself in the game just goes against anything I want to do for fun. It just seems like its so much more pervasive and overwhelming.  Combined with it being a historical setting, just hits too close to home.<br/><br/>I welcome controversy that comes up in games, assuming it doesn't fall outside of the social contract.  But a game based around a controversial thing, is just too much.  Even if only barely.  That said, if Stealing Back Jordan had been about enslaved sentient automatons, I'm sure I would have found it more inviting as a game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91976/#Comment_91976" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T22:00:31+00:00" title="August 30, 2007 10:00PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've had some really good experiences with no-holds-barred play.  In particular, a Shadow of Yesterday game my tabletop group here played back in the winter, albeit with a homebrewed *setting*, included cannibalism, torture, rape, necrophilia, forcible abortion, and also a lot of just general gory details along with the violence.  And we were all really genuinely fine with it.  I wouldn't call that campaign, entitled "The Reanimators of Veghost," issue-based play though.  It was actually more of a black comedy.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an aside, I have also seen really unhealthy situations where one person at the table is trying to play out their real-world psychological issues via the game, but no one else is really on board with that, and that's not really what the game is about.  That sort of behavior, while understandable, is extremely disrupting and, in my opinion, Not Cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut overall, I'm really into the idea of using RPGs to explore the darkness, and issues, and things like that--even things that may be an issue for us out of game.  It's something I'd like to do more of, in fact.  As I mentioned in another thread, I really liked the playtest of Grey Ranks that I got to participate in, and I'm *very* interested in Steal Away Jordan.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of my actual play experiences in the last few years have been somewhere in between:  adult themes definitely come up organically, but dealing with the real boundary-line topics (e.g., rape) isn't a main focus in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh" title="jdrakeh"><img alt="jdrakeh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/909/nZA3BEK4G6OHW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh">jdrakeh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91982/#Comment_91982" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T22:34:46+00:00" title="August 30, 2007 10:34PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: asdfff</cite><br>1) Controversial topics that come up in-game.

Unless said purpose is shock value for the sake of shock value. Satire is, naturally, an exception to this rule as it embodies thoughtful execution via shock value. <br><br>2.  This largely hinges on the above. I hate to pick on Dread: The First Book of Pandemonium, though the first edition is an apt example of the "shock value for the sake of shock value" bit that I mention above. There was a whole secret history of Earth that boiled down to 'Jesus was an alien and Christianity is a LIE!' -- it didn't actually do anything to add to game play and was a pretty transparent attempt to shock the reader. Ditto the liberal use of obscenities.<br><br>Now, I should clarify that I am <i>not</i> a Christian and that my dislike of this secret history didn't stem from some perceived slight against my religion (in fact, I don't claim a religion). What I hated that was that you could tear the pages detailing the secret history out of the book and the actual game play would remain completely unchanged. In fact, for me, the secret history took everything potentially cool about the game and ruined it. Suddenly, you're not fighting demons or evil, but space aliens who have no concept of good or evil. And Christianity SUXXORZ! <br><br>In short, the secret history of Dread cheapened the whole experience by turning this nifty, guilty pleasure, game about kicking evil's ass into a ham-fisted attempt at shocking readers by insulting a particular religious group in an embarassingly meaningless manner. The excessive profanity for the sake of profanity similarly cheapened the game. Every instance of "fuck" screamed "look at me! I'm cool and edgy!" in a "I desperately want people to think I'm cool" kind of way. I hesitate to say that it was my most disappointing game purchase <i>ever</i>, though it certainly ranks high on the list due to the shallow implementation of controverisal subject matter. <br/><br/>Now, contrast this with Dogs in the Vinyard. Dogs is another game that I didn't much care for, though I <i>could</i> respect it and don't consider it a disappointing purchase. It simply didn't embody a style of play that I care for. That said, the contoversial subject matter was executed with an eye toward making it meaningful in actual play. Shocking people didn't seem to be a factor. It's a game about solving problems. The author didn't feel the need to juice up the subject matter to shock the reader (in fact, he toned it down considerably -- read up on the Levites sometime) or shower the text with profanities for the sake of showering the text with profanities. <br/><br/>The former game embodies the kind of thoughtless, shallow, execution of controversial suject matter that I think game designers would do well to avoid. The latter, to its credit, is a masterful and tasteful execution of controversial subject matter that sought to explore said subject matter, rather than exploit it.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91985/#Comment_91985" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T23:05:37+00:00" title="August 30, 2007 11:05PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 30, 2007 11:06PM by Rafael.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi, James,\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdrakeh</cite>'Jesus was an alien and Christianity is a LIE!'</blockquote>\nNot that I'm trying to defend the game -- it is what it is, some people like it and some don't -- but I'm not sure where you got the alien thing. I thought that it was pretty clear that Jesus and Judas were descended from angels who mated with humans (thus their powers). Most of the people that I've talked to seemed to get that idea as well. Granted, some of them didn't like it for the same reason you didn't like it, but everyone else just thought, well, sure, angels and Jesus and stuff, what else are you going to see in a game about demons? I mean, I don't think that's any more shocking than a comic book like Preacher or Hellblazer. It certainly wasn't meant to shock -- considering how often writers revise the Christian cosmology in horror movies (Prophecy), fiction (anything by Clive Barker), and RPGs (Nephilim, Demon: The Fallen), I think it's kind of odd to say that toying with Christianity is intended to shock people.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdrakeh</cite>Ditto the liberal use of obscenities.</blockquote>\nAgain, I totally understand why you don't like it. But, for me, that's like saying that The Wire is trying to shock people, or The Shield, or your average Stephen King novel, or horror movie, or war movie, or M-rated video game. Does anyone really believe that profanity is shocking? When you watch an R-rated movie about criminals or cops or soldiers, do you feel that the writers are trying to shock you with 'bad words'? Personally, when I'm writing, I use profanity when I think it's supposed to be used, because that's how some people talk. For a game about junkies and disgraced FBI agents who fight serial killers that are possessed by demons... Well, it just seems pretty logical.<br/><br/>To clarify, I'm not saying that your dislike of the game is unjustified, I'm just saying that it's erroneous to ascribe some kind of intent to shock people. I think trying to be shocking is goofy. But it's also goofy to say 'gosh darn it' when someone has torn off one of your legs. Which happens a lot in Dread: The First Book of Pandemonium.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Parthenia" title="Parthenia"><img alt="Parthenia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/146/nKIT0S5D0Y5QY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Parthenia">Parthenia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91991/#Comment_91991" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T23:27:46+00:00" title="August 30, 2007 11:27PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Then there's Steal Away Jordan. And slavery is so dehumanizing and cruel that immersing myself in the game just goes against anything I want to do for fun. It just seems like its so much more pervasive and overwhelming. Combined with it being a historical setting, just hits too close to home.<br/><br/>I welcome controversy that comes up in games, assuming it doesn't fall outside of the social contract. But a game based around a controversial thing, is just too much. Even if only barely. That said, if <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Stealing Back</span> Steal Away Jordan had been about enslaved sentient automatons, I'm sure I would have found it more inviting as a game.</i><br/><br/>So do you think it's possible to play this game and engage in more pleasant pursuits, such as courtship, friendship, caring for your children, but within the confines of slavery?<br/><br/>Let's look at the game from a different angle. Right on the back I say it's not so much a game about slavery as much as it is a way to construct a slave narrative. Being a slave is a horrible lot, but people make the most of their situations and create bonds of love, friendship, art, music, etc. In demos I certainly emphasized the bad, but I only had 15-20 minutes to show the mechanics. In playtests it wasn't all rape, torture, and murder. There was sex, making allies, two characters escaped to freedom, one bought his freedom. There was lots of laughter at the table, and several characters had positive outcomes. You can play  sentient human beings and have fun with this game, I assure you.<br/><br/>But I get that it's not everyone's cup of tea. I just want to put it out there that 400 years of slavery in the Americas produced some people who did amazing, joyful things, and this is playable in Steal Away Jordan.<br/><br/>I'm also curious why it would be more enjoyable to play slaved automatons (albeit sentient) over actual people? What makes this more inviting? What hits too close to home playing a 18-19th century person?<br/><br/>(I'm looking forward the Battlestar Galactica Steal Away Jordan game)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>How well do you do with controversial topics? - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4096/how-well-do-you-do-with-controversial-topics/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="How well do you do with controversial topics? - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4096/how-well-do-you-do-with-controversial-topics/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Hmm.

It seems like there's a lot of thought here that controversial issues or difficult subject matter equals "dark". i don't think that's always going to be the case. In fact, I think it very often isn't. There are lots of issues that are difficult for people to address that have nothing to do with being "dark". here are a few things that have come up in recent games I've played or sat in on. Most of these things seem like very valid topics for game play to me, but I know that a lot of people see them as controversial.<br/><br/>Real world religion, religious power and beliefs<br/>Love and romantic relationships<br/>Sex and sexuality<br/>Gender identity<br/>Racism and other forms of descrimination<br/>Pregnancy<br/>Real world politics, both in context and as applied to fictional worlds<br/>Porn<br/>Education and teaching<br/>Censorship                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92035/#Comment_92035" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T06:26:09+00:00" title="August 31, 2007  6:26AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite><br/><br/>That's where I drew the line myself, above.

Some issues discussed here have become so well identified in our group over the years that GMs can include them and predict reactions: include slavery in a game, and my character will almost certainly end up slaver-hunting at some point, and it will likely involve hangings.  It's like a big red flag in a corrida.<br/><br/>Yet I am unlikely to ever pick up games like <i>carry</i>, <i>Steal Away Jordan</i>, <i>Classroom Deathmatch</i>, <i>Bacchanal</i>, or <i>Grey Ranks</i> on my own.  I might play them if a friend wants to run one of them and assures me it's an awesome game AND I happen to be in a mood where I can deal with the topic "cold".  Other than that, pardon my analogy but I need some foreplay.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92170/#Comment_92170" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T10:15:29+00:00" title="August 31, 2007 10:15AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2007 10:27AM by MikeRM.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Graham and JBR said.<br/><br/>But also, for me it's not just the topics, but the treatment. To use fiction as an example: I can handle the main characters suffering a lot if the suffering is ultimately meaningful and they respond to it heroically, that is, they sacrifice for the sake of others and to do the right thing and it comes out OK in the end. That's my personal preference in story. So I love Lois McMaster Bujold and Jim Butcher, who beat up their protagonists unmercifully but have upbeat endings. Futile and ultimately meaningless struggle, on the other hand, I just don't enjoy. Nor do I have any patience with passively suffering idiots, or selfish bastards who are just out for themselves and never face any consequences or gain any kind of insight or empathy.<br/><br/>In other words, in my fiction, movies and games, I like to get my view of how the universe <i>should be</i> reinforced, even if I'm aware that that's not how the universe always <i>is</i>. This can involve suffering and the existence of sexism and racism and slavery and other dark and evil things, but I want to see those things as being ultimately less powerful than the alternatives. It sounds like Steal Away Jordan supports that, which is great. I'm not sure that Grey Ranks does, given where its particular story stops. <br/><br/>And all of this, just to reinforce, is <i>my preference</i> - if yours is different, good for you, but we may not enjoy the same game.<br/><br/>EDIT: I just realized that a briefer way of saying this is "comedies (in the traditional-dramatics sense of stories with a resolution that involves restoration), not tragedies."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92196/#Comment_92196" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T10:48:58+00:00" title="August 31, 2007 10:48AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MikeRM</cite>I'm not sure that Grey Ranks does, given where its particular story stops.</blockquote>\nOne thing I really like about the game (I like many things about it, actually, go figure!) is that ultimate outcome is a mirror to the soul - there's nowhere in the rules that tells you your character must die, or be harmed in any way.

I bet she'd really enjoy Steal Away Jordan.  I shoulda bought it at the Con.  I didn't ask Julia for a demo though -- and I admit this with difficulty because this is really stupid -- because I felt kind of weird as a white male raised in a lily-white midwestern town, sitting down to play a game about slavery with a black woman.  I'm sorry, Julia.  If you noticed a dude who was watching you demo Steal Away Jordan with interest but shying away from approaching you for a demo, that was me, and I wasn't, like, stalking you or something, I was wrestling with live bits of Northern-style "we never ever ever talk about race" racism I didn't know I had twitching around in my brain.</p>\n<p>Ack.</p>\n<p>Anyway, yeah, re: the "slavery is so dehumanizing and cruel" thing, you know, it was indeed, but it was real, too.  It's a thing people did and had done to them, through most of human history.  People like you and me have lived their lives using and owning people or being used and owned by them.  American Black slavery is recent enough to horrify, and its scale was huge, but it wasn't different in <em>kind</em> than the sort of thing that's happened all along and still happens today...</p>\n<p>It seems like it's one of those things like Nazism where we turn it into a matter of angels and devils, a war of light and darkness, and forget that everyone involved were human, and it's that very <em>forgetting</em> that can allow it to happen again, without folks noticing, cause they don't see angels and devils doing it, but people...</p>\n<p>That's why I think a game which turns slavery into something that happens among and between humans instead of a mythic good-and-evil situation is inherently a valuable &amp; good thing.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/edheil" title="edheil"><img alt="edheil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/edheil">edheil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92313/#Comment_92313" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T14:36:32+00:00" title="August 31, 2007  2:36PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Oh, I almost forgot -- Mike, there should be a Godwin's Law but with FATAL instead of Nazis. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/edheil" title="edheil"><img alt="edheil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/edheil">edheil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92354/#Comment_92354" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T17:27:52+00:00" title="August 31, 2007  5:27PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2007 5:30PM by edheil.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>whoops, posted when I meant to whisper and don't know how to delete. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92437/#Comment_92437" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-01T08:14:47+00:00" title="September  1, 2007  8:14AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1. Yes, please. But, most of the time, there's no actual breaking of lines. When playing on the edges of our comfort zones, a wonderful tension can be felt in the group. <br/><br/>2. Yes - in fact, those games are highest on my list of "want to play now". Out of curiosity, out of a feeling that we're mutually looking at new ways of doing this, etc. <br/><br/>As Jason says, I feel that there's a difference between a game and what I'm doing with "We All Had Names". The word "game" has blocked my way so much that I don't want to use it where it doesn't apply. <br/><br/>Sometimes the word "therapy" comes up in these conversations. It's got nothing to do with it, as far as I'm concerned. If I watch a movie about some controversial topic, or discuss something with my friends that makes me feel tense and weird, I'm not going through therapy. I'm going through thought, reflection, emotion, learning, understanding, building stuff in my head.
