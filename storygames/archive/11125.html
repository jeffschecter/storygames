I thought I'd go massively self-indulgent and trawl through those games listed that I own with a few comments on how those that I have played worked.<br/><br/><b>Shatterzone</b> - We played a short campaign. The card mechanic was quite interesting in that it allowed for more player input to situations but ultimately it was not much more than a gimmic. FATE would be a much better system for this kind of game.<br/><br/><b>HeroQuest</b> - We played enormous amounts of RQ3 Glorantha (and Vikings) and so when it came to HQ, we were so immersed in the background that the new system didn't really add much to the game that we didn't already have. The new ruleset does give the GM much more food for thought on how to run games and that's possibly more useful than anything else.<br/> <br/><b>D&amp;D 3E</b> - This was the version of D&amp;D that tried to rationalise things and so took much of the fun out of the game. We go back to AD&amp;D for our gonzo heroic fantasy.<br/><br/><b>GURPS 4e</b> - With a couple of MiBs in our group, we were very experienced GURPS players and again it was a new edition that tidied some things up but ultimately did not bring anything significant to our games. We've since stopped playing GURPS.<br/><br/><b>Underground</b> - got it at a fire sale and never played it. It looks fine and has a depressing society mechanic in which stats always balance meaning an improvement in one area means a drop in another.<br/><br/><b>Burning Empires</b> - none of us has summoned up the courage to read it and whilst I'm interested in the meta-resolution ideas, there's enough in Mouse Guard that I don't like that I don't imagine I'll ever run it.<br/><br/><b>Continuum</b> - I was interested in the time travel ideas but have never even read it.<br/><br/><b>Big Eyes, Small Mouth</b> - We almost started a tri-stat near-Earth game but it didn't fly. It's simple and cute. I'm not sure it's interesting.<br/><br/><b>Sorcerer</b> - The game that launched a thousand games, so many that we don't now need to play the original.<br/><br/><b>Dragon Warriors</b> - got it to play with my brother, who then went of gaming so it has sat on the shelf for X years, and will stay there.<br/><br/><b>Miles Christi</b> - I'm fluent in French but none of my players are. I imagine that there would be interest in an historical game but we've plenty else in English.<br/><br/><b>Amazing Engine games</b> - bought for interest, which turned out to be slight.<br/><br/><b>Enemy Gods</b> - we played a few games of this and it is good fun although the combat mechanic is rather busted. It does produce good story but needs work to be more playable.<br/><br/><b>The Shab-Al-Hiri Roach</b> - a fun change of pace that we play about once every two years. It's got gonzo written all over it, but in a good way.<br/><br/><b>Unknown Armies</b> - I ran it once, the Donner Diner and it proved good support for a modern occult game. The magic system is exciting and immersive but the skill system is a bit too botchy. That said, it's also a great read and a game everyone should play at least once.<br/><br/><b>Everway</b> - a friend ran a juicy mythological game set in pseudo-Aztecia in which our enemies had stolen the moon. It turned out that it was with good reason, because we were the bad guys. The system seemed easy to use and interesting in its application of tarot.<br/><br/><b>Don't Rest Your Head</b> - Played at cons only. We meandered about trying to not be mad, but ended up mad anyway. It seemed similar to Call of Cthulhu except the focus was just on the madness. A little too narrow for my tastes.<br/><br/><b>A|State</b> - I got this as payment for writing Prisoner <a href="/forums/search?Search=%238&amp;Mode=like">#8</a> for Cold City and we've never got round to it. I think the moment may have passed.<br/><br/><b>Prince Valient</b> - bought for collecting purposes, it is a story game with a simple but workable mechanic.<br/><br/><b>Trail Of Cthulhu</b> - played the heck out of this this year and discovered more ways in which it is wonderful. If you really get involved with the system, it delivers good stuff, especially with the drives and the use of benefits.<br/><br/><b>Reign</b> - Played once, run by Ben our French friend and possibly the world's most enthusiastic Reign supporter (check out his APs on RPG.net). We didn't understand that we had to pull together at the start, and then, after having suffered, we did and pulled out all the dirty tricks we could muster. It was fun although I'm not sure of the extent to which it supports internecine conflict which is popular in our group.<br/><br/><b>Exalted</b> - played at Cons with White Wolf enthusiast who are oneupmanspersons first and gamers second and so disappointing. It's probably a fine, crunchy, game.<br/><br/><b>Fantasy HERO</b> - made a character for this and it took about an hour. Decided to play GURPS instead because it was simpler.<br/><br/><b>H\u014dL</b> - I ran an extended adventure of this that included much gonzo weirdness (remember the Take That - Shampoo wars anyone?) and was great fun. It actually works! Although I'm not sure you'd want to do anything but the occasional one-off with it.<br/><br/><b>ARIA</b> - My wife bought this for me for Xmas one year and the fact that I've never played it is often used to tease me. I'm not sure I could play it either.<br/><br/><b>Buffy and Angel</b> - I ran a tight Victorian South London game of Buffy in which the Scoobies were in a gang with Billy Pratt (future Boris Karloff) and made monsters whilst fighting Vampires and French demon bowlers. It was enormous fun, pulpy in the right way and did a fine job of emulating the feel of the TV show.<br/><br/><b>Mutants &amp; Masterminds</b> - We played some of this but the system was so crunchy that the main entertainment was from the groups arguments about what our name should be. I won with "the Committee" because my PC had intimidation 35 (which she only ever used on other group members).<br/><br/><b>In Nomine</b> - one of my MiB freebies that has just gathered dust. We made PCs once but then couldn't be bothered to play. It lacks the humour of the original.<br/><br/><b>Over The Edge</b> - my go-to system, simple but with enough hooks for any story gamer to get stuck right in. Have used it for Glorantha, Cthulhu, and others, even Al Amarja. It doesn't scale much at all and is no good if you want character advancement, but neither of those things concern me.<br/><br/><b>GURPS Hellboy</b> - I was the main MiB Hellboy support at one point. I wrote seven scenarios and we played a lot of this, sometimes with the Hellboy crew, sometimes with a more balanced team based in London. Highlights include Gardeners World live from Highgrove and a living Jesus statue being macheted to death whilst doing the washing up. Admittedly GURPS is perhaps not the best system for this game, we went very light sometimes, but it does cope well with scale and that was useful when the crew included a norm and Hellboy.<br/><br/><b>The Shadow of Yesterday</b> - it was on IPR.<br/><br/><b>Pendragon</b> - We played lots of this game and even used the Pendragon Pass mod for running Glorantha but although it worked, we tired of the eternal "none shall pass" and settled on running adjacent fiefdoms which proved much more interesting and storyish. The trait system does a good job of creating story and reminding the players who their character is.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247050/#Comment_247050" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-16T07:45:30+00:00" title="December 16, 2009  7:45AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Anyone else?

Loved the cards. Guy running it was serious dude-in-mom's-basement gamer, though, so that didn't last long before things got weird.<br/><br/>Chill: Man, vague memories of playing a session or two. I think I've forgotten more gaming sessions than I'll ever remember.<br/><br/>Robotech: Part of a general Palladium era for me. Late high school. Also Rifts, Fantasy and TMNT IIRC OMG BBQ.<br/><br/>Kult: Never ran it straight but was totally, 100% committed to the setting for many years.<br/><br/>D&amp;D3.x: Yeah...hashed through it a few times with my D&amp;D fanboy buddy. Unfulfilling...it was my trad methadone while I started moving hard into indieland.<br/><br/>GURPS4: My go-to game for a decade.<br/><br/>The entire Storyteller library: Yeah...sure was nice to fucking sell them all and get on with my life.<br/><br/>Burning Empires: Played MANY times, continues to generate the most consistently fun gaming time of my current RPing life.<br/><br/>Shock: A couple times now but it doesn't quite tickle my fancy during actual play. Love the situation-making element of it though.<br/><br/>SPI's Universe: Thanks for the blast from the past, Brad! Never actually *played* Universe, but had it with me for a couple summers at my grandparents' ranch. Spent MANY lonely hours generating world maps and other mappy goodness. Lots to like. In retrospect, it seems unplayable. Didn't it also have a ... a space combat boxed game? Or am I thinking of the Spacemaster boxed space fighty game?<br/><br/>Everway: Tried and failed for the usual reasons. Tweet and I even talked about it, and he had a very indie response: "Well...the game may just not be for you."<br/><br/>Continuum: Similar to Andy's experience, except I never sold it (or Further Information). I do believe I'll be doing the Mouse Guard hack of it though. That's pretty much genius.<br/><br/>Reign: Ran a campaign for four months, discovered the Company rules are buuuusted, quit in disgust. And what a shame, because there's a lot to like about it. It's like Baby's First Burning Wheel in some ways. Also, organizational issues kind of smothered any amount of forgiveness I may have been harboring.<br/><br/>HERO: Once upon a time, it was pretty darned neat. But the total lack of guidance on setting-making meant all that open-ended goodness was just license for insane game-breaking math shenanigans. I speak specifically of Fantasy HERO...I have to assume Champions etc. follows a similar arc.<br/><br/>Mouse Guard: Fuck yes I've played it. Anyone with issues with the setting: Get over it you sissy. OMG I can't believe the hangup people have with playing the wrong kind of make-believe. So you're a mouse. Christ, how's that worse than pretending to be an ELF?<br/><br/>Dust Devils: Played many, many times. I have a firm grasp of the game's deeper problems but for the most part, it generates a goood time around here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247090">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247090/#Comment_247090" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-16T10:10:07+00:00" title="December 16, 2009 10:10AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Bushido!</b> It's on the list, and I played the hell out of it in middle school.

I ran it for five or six years almost exclusively, doing all sorts of chrs. I also tried Pendragon Pass for Glorantha, but the game never really got out of playtest. Turns out that PD is a vast generator of scenarios for your game, and when you change the setting you lose a lot of the infrastructure.<br/><br/><b>HeroQuest \u2013</b> HQ is my BRP for the new millenium.

TORG was the game that turned me into a full-blown "Gamer". It was the utter wholeness of the back-end system that scaled in time/distance/weight, all the way up to the Aysle Magical Spell Creation chart, which was more complicated but tighter than many business process flowcharts I've seen. Ran a few mini-campaigns, one shots, and a few long campaigns. <br/><br/><b>DC Heroes</b><br/>Run a few sessions of this. Again, the smooth, complete internal consistency was sexy, but man did it take a long time to make characters, even back in high school. I still love the fact that you can have 10,000 fully statted NPC warriors vs Elric-Stormbringer, and the rules scale.<br/><br/><b>KULT</b><br/>I love Clive Barker/Silent Hill style "Hell-world next to ours". Didn't care for the system, but the setting and themes were evocative enough that I used them for everything from Unknown Armies to Risus. <br/><br/><b>D&amp;D 3e</b><br/>Played the hell out of it in the early 2000s, then got sick of it beyond level 7-8 or so (as a player or a DM). When I ran my eyes over E6 and gave it a try again, it made the game fresh and new for me, and excited the hell out of me: It basically neutered every major quibble I had with "D&amp;D" at the time (career planning, ability bloat, monster power bloat, etc). Played a sandbox-ish game set in a frozen wasteland (with a Spirit Shaman/Thief Elf). Recently I got the Rokugan book and plan to get the Oriental Adventures 3.X book in order to run a 3e E6 game set in Rokugan.<br/><br/><b>Eclipse Phase</b><br/>Lord oh lord is this book pretty. Combines really hard SF with some goofier soft SF, but overall I find it exciting and far more compelling than other "setting-based SF games" (Transhuman Space, etc). The system, though, is so boring that I want to curl up and go to sleep on it. I could import the setting wholesale into d6, Risus, TSOY or even Shock: though.<br/><br/><b>Savage Worlds</b><br/>I never really understood the buzz about this game when it first came out. When it was revised in the full-color edition, I gave it a second look and was blown away by its simplicity and scale. It's a light combat-y RPG with some social stuff that scales from barfights to army vs army within the same system. It's become my go-to engine when I want something fast and fighty. I was particularly impressed when I was able to completely create a character from scratch, with advantages and equipment, in 90 seconds (a "Captain Mal" character).<br/><br/><b>Vampire The Requiem</b><br/>I've got a generational campaign set in Raleigh on my mind. I want the Long Campaign, and I think VtR will be the vessel with which I set sail.<br/><br/><b>Exalted</b><br/>Loved the first edition core book, ran about 3 mini-campaigns set in original worlds (original settings still within the over-arching structure of the giant default world). Fatsplats were cute but tiring. Bought the 2ed corebook but never played that edition, but friends confirmed that the internal rules are very internally consistent and tight, but the overall whole is just Too Fucking Much as a GM to keep in mind when creating challenges, major NPCs, etc.<br/><br/><b>Sorcerer</b><br/>Had 3 incredible experiences with the system, and 4 mediocre experiences with the system. Sorcerer and Sword is what turned me on to the whole Indie Thang. Brilliant in its conciseness and potency, but I won't play it again until the Unbound notes are complete and available.<br/><br/><b>Shock</b><br/>Ran 2 one-shots and 1 campaign. One of the one shots and the campaign were great, one of the one shots was dumb. I really love this game, I wish the writing were a little more accessible but otherwise I think of it as the single RPG that lets me do Greg Egan-style Hard SF the way it should be done.<br/><br/><b>Legend of the Five Rings</b><br/>I like the background, as odd a mishmash as it is. It just needed a system with some S-G style tweaks. I cobbled a suite of homebrew hacks to overlay the core system, and set up the game from a situation rather than characters. We played a campaign for a number of months in what ended up being a solid tale. Really cool, but I recommend hacking the system to your tastes first. Luckily L5R is imminently hackable.<br/><br/><b>Trail of Cthulhu</b><br/>I have ToC and Esoterrorists. Been meaning to run it but other things take priority. Been meaning to play it but haven't had an opportunity. I love Delta Green, and in my little head I imagine this to be the perfect system for DG-style games.<br/><br/><b>Reign</b><br/>The 10 die cap on rolls is dumb: You can't attack and defend and expect to have a slew of doubles and triples, even with a 10-die pool.<br/><br/><b>ARIA</b><br/>I thought for a long time that this game was brilliant. Then I realized that it's only brilliant as an RPG if it's playable.<br/><br/><b>Mechaton</b><br/>Played it once. It was fun, a little weird with the initiative system, but otherwise I liked it.<br/><br/><b>GURPS 4e</b><br/>I forgot why I picked up this book, I think we were measuring up systems for an SF game and for some reason one of the other players didn't want to play HardNova II because it wasn't "Rules-y Enough". Turned out GURPS was *too* "Rules-y". Never followed through with selling it off.<br/>Used to have 3e and a ton of books, way back in the day, but never played it.<br/><br/><b>Buffy</b><br/>I loved the idea that all non-PCs have just three stats, period. You never roll dice for NPCs, but instead you roll dice for PCs trying to beat the NPC score in that area. Otherwise, ho hum.<br/><br/><b>Artesia</b><br/>Very large and colorful. Apparently there's a system somewhere in there but all I remember is that I get to character generation, I black out, then next thing I remember I'm looking at the cool rules for advancement based on the Major Arcana of Tarot cards.<br/><br/><b>Over the Edge</b><br/>Someone else said that it's out of date. I dunno. But I think it needed more guidance on how to create the island of Al Amarja (sp?). Apparently ALL of the setting material for that game was from the author's homebrew setting. That's nice, but some pointers on how to go that route and making up our own group setting/canon would have been awesome.<br/>And yet, I ran it for a mini-campaign. Pretty cool, but it's been enough years that I forget what happened.<br/><br/><b>The Shadow of Yesterday</b><br/>Ran the original d6-based system for a year. Ran the Solar System version for a second year, same setting. The setting was a homebrew "Fantasy China Meets Stargate" world.

Making characters was a lot of fun, but the actual play of the game was often a bit clunky and difficult due to the scaling of powers and the rather broken writeups for the heroes and villains of the setting. <br/><br/>Shatterzone: I played this with my brothers back when it first came out. It was a pretty crap experience, we hated the cards, hated the system, and the shine came off the setting in pretty short order. We ditched it after two games and went back to Shadowrun. <br/><br/>HeroQuest: I played a lot of HQ. I really wanted to love this game, and I really never did. I loved struggling with it though, trying to force it to reach the potential I thought I saw in it. But almost every game I played with it failed me in some way, and in the end I had to let it go. <br/><br/>Ars Magica: Ars, oh sweet, failed Ars. I played a game of this for a year, off and on, in Uni. There was so much in this game that worked, along with so much that was maddening. The fiddle with lab work, out of session play, and the endless bookkeeping was maddening to me \u2013 especially as some of the others in the group really got off on it and would spend endless amounts of time playing semi-lonely fun games off the game we played together. But at the same time the game gave me the first tastes of troop play, split-GMing, running multiple levels of characters in the same game in a functional framework, and the ways that games can use myth and history to give a powerful framework for stories. <br/><br/>Unknown Armies: So I\u2019ve played like five campaigns and endless oneshots of this. Game\u2019s fucking brilliant. One Shots is still one of my first go-tos when I\u2019ve got some folks who want to play something funky and not a lot of time to prep or patience to learn arcane rules that force you to reconfigure how you approach narrative. <br/><br/>CyberPunk 2010/2020: They\u2019re hardly the same game, but I played them both. For whatever reason, 2010 was always about fucked up people in a fucked up future just trying not to get got. 2020 was always about guys with more metal than Arnold in the Terminator movies blowing shit up while doing backflips off the top of buildings. <br/><br/>Artesia: I was enthused enough about the setting of this game that I got my group to give it a try. We ended up, very very quickly, plaing in the setting but having very little to do with the rules. The character sheets would act as touch points for karma/drama resolution, and the relationships were grist for the story mill, but past that we had little interest in working with the system. Then there were babies born in real life to various group members, and the game kinda drifted off into the nothing. <br/><br/>Rifts: I played this when I was a teenager. It was a game to be played by teenagers with a pushy GM who didn\u2019t mind fucking over the rules. Rock on, you crazy Glitterboy. <br/><br/>Exalted: Another brilliant game, surrounded by cruft. None the less, it was my go to game for a couple years, and I had three very long, very successful campaigns of the game that mostly used the system in the RAW, and are well remembered by everyone who played. The reasons I left the game were partly burnout from the amount of effort it takes to GM well, and partly a growing sense of discontent with the grotesque anime-fantasy-fascism of the setting. <br/><br/>Mutants and Masterminds: It\u2019s a great system for running guys in tights who mostly run around and hit other guys with tights. Spiffy. I mean, it doesn\u2019t do a huge amount of telling you how to do a story, because it mostly assumes that your story is about guys in tights hitting guys in tights. But it does that pretty well. <br/><br/>Shab-Al-Hiri-Roach: As with most games of the Roach, it ended up with my character being sodomized with the wine bottle he\u2019d just used to kill another PC. <br/><br/>TSOY: I struggle with TSOY much like I did with HQ. But unlike with HQ, the struggle of TSOY is starting to pay off. The first couple games I played in TSOY were fun, but ultimately flat and rather unsupported by the system. But over time, and with some GM and player skill, we\u2019ve learned to move system and subject closer together and build something that may actually be sustainable. (The first step was decoupling narration rights from the dice, btw. I\u2019ve decided I hate that shit. Thank you to Houses of the Blooded for making me realize how much I hate it.) <br/><br/>Pendragon: One of the great games of my life. Its hard for me to say, in retrospect, if my love of the Matter of Britain came from Pendragon, or my love of Pendragon came from my love of Arthur. I was studying English lit and playing lots of RPGs, and the two hit hard at about the same time and swept me away. The games I played of this were amazing. However, these days I play it much less often as there are certain difficulties in selling it to a group made up mostly of women and with a strong anti-imperialist bias. <br/><br/>Truth and Justice: I played a couple year long campaign of T&amp;J, and it was a pretty good system for the way I do supers. It\u2019s got some more drive towards story and player interface with narrative than Mutants and Masterminds, but without over storyboarding it. Nice system. <br/><br/>World of Darkness: I play this shit to death. Did in the day, still do. Mostly these days I ignore the Storyteller system. It isn\u2019t that I hate it, its just that it doesn\u2019t really help, so I replace it with something else. <br/><br/>Everway: This game was my first \u201cstruggle with its potential until you give up on its inability to be what you need it to be\u201d game. Still, it taught me a lot about GMing, and I still love the visionary aspects of play. <br/><br/>Big Eyes, Small Mouth: I\u2019ve little to add to Steve\u2019s analysis here. Simple, cute, not interesting. <br/><br/>Reign: It\u2019s okay. The company rules worked quite well, but the world never quite grabbed the way I was hoping it would. Next time I\u2019m probably going to use the rules from A Dirty World (which we\u2019ve had much more success with) and the company rules from Reign and a world more close to our own devising. <br/><br/>Buffy: Save the Last Slayer \u2013 Buffy meets the \u201cwhite girl in a black school learns to dance\u201d genre of movies. It was fun, participationist brain bubblegum. <br/><br/>Sorcerer: I still owe Ron a headbutt for this shit. Not that the game is bad, mind you, just that the writing in the books and the general difficulty in grasping things has never led to me having a terribly positive experience of the game. I see the potential, but most of the games I\u2019ve actually played have been pain.<br/><br/>Polaris: On the other hand, I owe Ben a hug for this one. Ignore the thing in the book where it says everyone doesn't need to read the book. Everyone does, because the book contains a lot of seed material that will bloom a grow, but only if everyone has actually read it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247746/#Comment_247746" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T07:08:05+00:00" title="December 21, 2009  7:08AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This was a fun thread to read because it gave candid reviews of a lot of games I don't have and probably won't. <br/><br/>So... What is on my shelf?<br/><br/>Old White Box D+D: Haven't played it in decades. Probably will never play it again but is is the game that I started with. When I run D+D it is a mutant home version of this game that has very little to do with D+D anymore. <br/><br/>Original Traveler: Right next to D+D. Again I'll probably never play them again. I keep them for syntamental reasons. It was fun in high school.<br/><br/>FASA Star Trek: (Still in the shrink wrap.) This is really my wife's game. She was dating the game designer and was a play tester. The lesson of this game was "Get off the ship as soon as possible."<br/><br/>FASA Dr Who: Also my wife's game for the same reason as above. Hate the system but love Dr. Who. I've played it at cons and it has given my some damned fun experiences. Not because of the game but due to role playing to the hilt.<br/><br/>Call of Cthulhu: (I forget the edition). I love Cthulhu. The best role play games I've ever played were Cthulhu games at Gen Con. That said the system is okay but not stellar. What I love is slowly going insane. When I ran Cthulhu games after my Dad dies back in college it was cathartic and expressed my pain. <br/><br/>Space 1889: The first version (I think they've redone it.) I've tried to run it, I love the elegant look of the system, but have never been able to actually play it. Frank Chadwick told me that Sapce 1889 players are born and not made. The historical bits were written by Howard Whitehouse (Science versus Pluck) and are great. I'll keep it even if I don't play it.<br/><br/>Champions: People I gamed with ran it. I bought it to be in the crowd. It is very combat oriented and SLOWWWWWW. I've run it a few times and found how twitchy it is. You can blow the players out or be blown out by them very easily so the balance is hard. I won't play it again.<br/><br/>Justice Inc. : This was the low powered version of Champions that worked sooo much better. I don't play it but would.<br/><br/>Buffy: I occassionally run games of this at Christmas for my wife and brother. It's made some fun games but more due to the subject matter than the system. I've never got to play it out at Cons. I think it would be fun. I'm saddened that the series went out of people's imaginations so fast after it went off the air. I work with College students and they just don't know the show. When it started they were 6.<br/><br/>D+D 3ed: I got the players handbook when it came out and ran a few games of it at the local game store. Then I realized that I would have to work real hard to relearn the game. I just couldn't muster the enthusiasm. It sits there now, unplayed. <br/><br/>So you want to be a Rock and Roll Star?: You haven't heard of it? Well... lets just keep it that way. It was a game from the late 80's that missed the mark and which I've never played.<br/><br/>Science versus Pluck: A military RPG set in the British colonial wars of the late 19th century. Amazing fun as a con game. I've neve run it because you need great figures and huge amazing terrain. Storing said terrain is too much for me. Still as a read it has great ideas even today.<br/><br/>QAGS  (Quick Ass Game System - by Hex Games): I play this game out at Cons because my brother runs it. It is a fun rules light system and works well for story games because you start the game with "Yum Yums" (it tokens) that allow you to add to the game and not have to roll for critical scenes. <br/><br/>I mainly play my own Engle Matrix Games on line and they have moved a long way towards being board games so  they don't really fit here anymore. I'm a bad consumer of games anymore - since I started making my own. <br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247907/#Comment_247907" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T16:30:10+00:00" title="December 21, 2009  4:30PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 21, 2009 4:56PM by johnzo.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            C'mon, I can't be the only one to have played Alternity ...
