Hacking <i>Mud Dragon</i> to represent adventurers (instead of...well...mud dragons) would produce a far more interesting product...and one that is actually funny.<br/><i>Irrepressible</i> feels like a casual reinterpretation of <i>Monkey</i>, with a very conversational way of describing the various gods and immortals (at least, the ones that actually get descriptions). It's not really bad, but not very memorable (in fact, I can remember NOTHING about the mechanics, even though I'm trying to remember). I originally got it because it kind of had the feel of the modern Chinese wuxia TV dramas, and thought I could use it or hack it to do my own Journey to the West campaign. Instead, <i>Monkey</i> and <i>God-King</i> (even though God-King isn't strictly set in ancient China) are a better choice for me (mixed together, in fact).<br/><br/>EDIT: This is, of course, just my opinion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381713/#Comment_381713" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-10T10:39:24+00:00" title="June 10, 2012 10:39AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Word.<br/><br/>I pitched the idea of curation and reviews to the new owners. <br/><br/>They did not bite.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381719/#Comment_381719" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-10T11:25:25+00:00" title="June 10, 2012 11:25AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not much to do about this anymore, really; at one point IPR could've been built towards a more exclusive boutique direction, with curation and expertise, but that ship sailed years ago. As I understand it, the overriding interest is to increase volume to improve efficiency - the core services of fulfillment scale very well, so taking on as much product as possible makes good sense economically. Probably means that the fulfillment service is the wrong place to expect this sort of cultural awareness. (One could argue that curation safeguards brand value, but perhaps the IPR brand is the wrong thing to develop.)<br/><br/>My own recommendation would be for separate, unaffiliated journalism; if somebody were to take up the challenge of covering the no-name indies better just so we could actually notice when something noteworthy comes out, I'd be a reader, and so would many others. IPR is a great starting point to choose for targets, but of course the real hinterlands exist out there in the unscoped depths of RPGNow and such, from whence there's no guarantee whatsoever for me to ever even hear about a given product, no matter how special it might be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381725/#Comment_381725" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-10T12:17:42+00:00" title="June 10, 2012 12:17PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On DriveThru you can set up e-mail reminders for new entries based on genre, publisher, etc.  I don't recall 'indie' being one of the categories though.<br/>--<br/>TAZ                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381736">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381736/#Comment_381736" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-10T15:36:53+00:00" title="June 10, 2012  3:36PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The idea of reviews is a great one, and could happen without curation.

Sorry it has taken me this long to get back to all of you. Much to do, little time to do it, and so forth. <br/><br/>In short: I agree. We should do what we can to encourage customers to review products on the IPR website. There's a review function that you can use after you've signed in. It's located at the bottom of the page under Customer Feedback. However, it's little used, even with the most popular of products. <br/><br/>I think the best way to do this would be to somehow encourage customers to review what they have purchased on the IPR website. Normally this would happen rather organically, but it doesn't seem to with IPR. Do any of you have suggestions? A rewards program, perhaps?

We may also pair it down further by removing non-physical products that haven't sold over a long peroid of time. <br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Hans">@Hans</a> - A lot of things done on the current website - like not linking it to blogs, including the one that hosted Ken's columns - were done for security reasons based on the software we use. We handle people's financial information, and we take that responsiblity *very* seriously. <br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/J">@J</a>. Walton, Luke, etc - If by currated you mean that we let some games in and not others, then yes it is currated. If by currated you mean that (for example) we exclusively sell a select group of storytelling games that reflect the taste of a single person or small group of people, then no. There are logical and personal reasons for this:<br/><br/>Firstly, I don't want to be that person - and if there is anything that three plus years of working for IPR (plus a decade in the tabletop game industry) has taught me, is that I would <span style="text-decoration: underline;">have</span> to be that person. There's not enough time for me to playtest every game that is submitted and get my day-to-day work done. (Though I do try. I enjoy reading and playing games, after all, and I like reading new submissions a great deal.) And I'm simply not a critic by temperment, and honestly wouldn't make as good a one as (for example) Luke or Ron (Edwards) if I tried. (And I mean that respectfully.) I'm too much of a "Wow, that's cool!" person. <br/><br/>Secondly, it doesn't match my vision for Indie Press Revolution, which I see as a service for micropublishers attempting to bring their unique vision to market. Whenever possible I include, rather than exclude, and I particularly gravitate to eccentric or experimental products, regardless of how financially viable or critically praised they may be. (Or even if they're roleplaying games.) Because that is what IPR does and should do IMO: help unusual, hard-to-get, or experimental games get into the hands of customers and retailers.  <br/><br/>(I understand that there is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">considerable</span> debate about words like "storytelling," "experimental," and "unique" in regards to roleplaying games. Debating them is a not-insignificant part of this site, and the online gaming world in general. So please bear with me - there are only so many words to choose from.)  <br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Eero">@Eero</a> - Yes and no. IPR has certain fincanial goals it must reach to simply pay its bills, and thus stay in business. It has secondary goals that it must reach to qualify as a worthwhile economic entity: meaning, something worth being owned by its investors. It also requires an amazing amount of time and effort on every level to run IPR, for really very modest returns. For these reasons, as well as the ones I've listed above, I would rather it be more inclusive than less. <br/><br/>I hope that answers some of your questions.

Which is frustrating as a publisher, because of course when people arrive at your product page you want them to see confirmation that it's good.<br/><br/>Actually, IPR needs a wider strategy including ways to draw stuff to people's attention after it's dropped off the front page.<br/><br/>I wonder if the simplest possible solution is to have a blog format attached to the site, that's highly searchable. The IPR guys make a short, factual post for each product. Other folks can then post comments. I suppose there'd be a time overhead with moderation though. Or a wiki or something. Or some integration with the RPGnet Index... <br/><br/>If you had a small group of reviewers who were pretty reliable at doing some level of feedback for products they got, I'd think most publishers would be happy to comp at least the PDF. I've been burned before with people saying they'd do a review and it never appearing. I think as a publisher with a new product, the most valuable thing is to get *something* positive out there *fast*.

Because that sounds way, way better to me than that second sentence. (Which I hasten to add isn't the case for IPR at the moment.)<br/><br/>So let's talk about the logistics of this (for lack of a better word). What I'm taking away here is that most of you on this thread - and most of you are author/designer/publishers - would like for IPR to have a team of in-house reviewers. That's not unreasonable, but there are a few things to consider. We're *not* going to post negative reviews of our member-publisher's products (though I wouldn't stop a customer from doing it). It will require some of my time to organize a group of reviewers and keep them reviewing things consistantly month-after-month, year-after-year (which I could do, though my time is honestly quite precious). We can't afford to pay people in cash to review things (though possibly in products), and there is based on past experience no way to link on open source program like Wordpress into X-Cart without in essense hoisting a giant sign that says "Hackers go here!" (Which can and will never happen.)  <br/><br/>It's perfectly fair to want high-quality, impartial reviews of products. Everyone wants that. But it isn't fair to ask the rep/fullfillment house (in this case IPR) to be the one that provides them if they undermine the publishers they represent. I'm also not crazy about asking you guys to provide free, physical products to give out to outside reviewers who may, or may not, in my experience ever get around to reviewing them - and whose reviews may, or may not, get anything sold. (There are probably two or three text reviewers and two or three podcasts that can actually move copies of a game with a positive review: but they tend to be massively backlogged. Though I'm <span style="text-decoration: underline;">always</span> happy to be proven wrong.) <br/><br/>Sure, our contract says we can take five copies of everything you send us - but I almost never do, because my job at its core is to translate those copies into money for you: not to give them away with limited or no return to anyone. And *not* to criticize them in house once you've been accepted as a member-publisher. That would be dishonerable and self-defeating.  <br/><br/>So I think the best thing to do would be to distribute PDF copies of new products to a select group of outside reviewers each month. I think we would have to revise the IPR-publisher contract a bit, but it could be done.  How does that sound? Does anybody want to volunteer that can commit to, say, reviewing a game a month for the next two years?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383753/#Comment_383753" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-28T12:49:12+00:00" title="June 28, 2012 12:49PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As I said upthread, I specifically think that it's not a good idea for IPR to take the lead in increasing rpg journalism. It would be possible for a different type of fullfillment service, but not the kind IPR is and strives to be. It would be a waste of resources and a moral hazard in the offing, just for the reasons Jason outlines. Better to invest in developing IPR's general capabilities as a sales channel and fulfillment service in product-neutral ways. There is nothing preventing any of us from establishing an independent website for critical rpg reviewing; such a site would have no trouble whatsoever saying that a new IPR product is shitty and should not be purchased by the discerning customer. <i>That</i> would be the sort of site one might expect to provide insightful, ambitious and informative review action on small press rpgs. IPR could link products to reviews on such a separate site, even, should the site reach a level of quality that satisfies IPR.<br/><br/>Now, something IPR <i>could</i> do would be to raise the standards of publisher-provided marketing material. This would take a bit of rethinking of the website, how the customer interfaces with it, but there's no insurmountable reason for why an individual product's "product description" couldn't involve more text, pictures and even video - an essay on the product instead of a small blurp. (Think crowdfunding spiel instead of a one-paragraph explanation, perhaps.) IPR could set some rough standards and Jason could perhaps encourage individual publishers to get on with the program (on a voluntary basis, of course) for the benefit of creating a more informative browsing experience. By having the material be publisher-created IPR preserves the relationship with its clients.<br/><br/>Of course, one might ask why simple links to the websites of the publishers themselves don't suffice in this regard. They probably do, except in cases where the publisher doesn't have an informative website. Or perhaps they don't, and customers would prefer to have all products introduced in detail in a consistent way right on the IPR site. Consistency might be a big benefit if a high-quality format were developed for showcasing products on the IPR site, instead of relying on each publisher being able and willing to create a compelling website of their own. I know that I myself would love it if new products had sufficiently in-depth marketing material for me to figure out whether they involve e.g. modern game design vs. traditional game writing. This is something the publisher is perfectly capable of answering as long as somebody pokes them about it.<br/><br/>Incidentally, I'm totally up for reviewing games, provided that you're OK with brutal honesty from a picky asshole. Heck, I've reviewed about 150 games for our own webstore already, so I already have reviewed quite a few IPR games, too. Of course I'm also a publisher (and one dealing with IPR, no less), so this might run into the same moral issues IPR in-house critique would. I can imagine how people might not be very happy with it if I started to publish reams of English-language critical reviews of their games while selling my own on the side.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383868">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray" title="Tim_Gray"><img alt="Tim_Gray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray">Tim_Gray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383868/#Comment_383868" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-29T08:08:52+00:00" title="June 29, 2012  8:08AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Useful debate.
