Unfortunately, there's only a few folks that have the ability to flip topics/edit posts (although the topic starter can always go back and edit their posts), so it happens when we both have time and catch it.<br/><br/>I also don't mind everyday folks asking a poster via WHISPER to please change the topic ("Hey, this looks like Directed Promotion, would you mind editing your post and changing the category?"). Just don't be an asshole about it. There definitely is a polite and simple way to ask someone to change a topic (as per the quote above), and a passive-aggressive asshole way to do so (which I've seen in other threads, not from Nathan mind you). Keep it simple and polite and it'll all work out.<br/><br/>So, topic categories as a whole: Some lines are finer than others as to which category a particular topic falls into. I think we can all agree what "Forum Discussion" means. But aside from that, I really don't care too much where topics fall into which categories... with the exception of Directed Promotion.<br/><br/>I dunno if its me drinking whatever Kool-Aid that J Walton's been drinking for years, but even from early on here I've wanted to maintain a disciplined separation of "Hey, look at the stuff I'm selling/offering for free/promoting!" from the other play/design/discussion threads. I can't put my finger on why, but not doing so, and including promotional stuff with the gaming stuff, is irritating for me.<br/><br/>Luckily, it seems that many others agree. And in the linked thread above (not the Conan on LSD one) it was clear that the original poster simply forgot/it slipped his mind, so it was nothing for him to go back and change it, all is cool.<br/><br/>Anyway, just some thoughts.<br/><br/>Note: Stuff to Watch is an exception. I totally do not mind if people promote their stuff in those threads as it happens, because that's just a catch-all for new stuff.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
