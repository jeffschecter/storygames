And this time, we've brought a friend...<br/>\n<br/>\nThis year the Play Collective and the bold adventure that is the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.ashcanfront.net" rel="nofollow">Ashcan Front</a> have joined forces to grow our space together. You'll be able to browse the fine works on display in our half of the booth, then simply stroll a few feet to finger through the assembled ashcans offered by the Front.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe members of the Play Collective are brought together by our passion for independent publishing, creation and design. We want to share our enthusiasm, inspiration and practical advice. If you have a great idea for a game and wonder how to shepherd it through design, presentation, marketing and sales then you need to be <i>right there</i> at our booth, talking to us.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to talk game design and publishing with us, the we've got a huge range of experience and skills so that we can give you the right kind of help. Graphic design, marketing, game systems, con presence, artwork, we have experts in every field you could want to talk about.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, who are we?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Collective is made up of Vincent Baker, Tony Lower-Basch, Emily Care Boss, Joshua A.C. Newman, Elizabeth Shoemaker, Robert Bohl, Matt Machell, Judd Karlman and me, Malcolm Craig. Every single one of us has been through the process of design, sometimes many, many times. Some of us are on the booth for the first time, others were part of the Collective last year. But, regardless of all that, we share an enthusiasm for what we're doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe're not just about talk though. We have all put our expertise into practice and the Play Collective can offer you a stunning range of the absolute best in games. We have brand new releases, recognised favourites, even some stuff you might not have encountered before.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b><a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.lumpley.com" rel="nofollow">Vincent Baker</a></b> will be offering all his usual goodness in the form of the outstanding 'Dogs In The Vineyard', 'Poison'd' and the first Gen Con appearance of 'In A Wicked Age'.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b><a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://misspentyouthgame.com" rel="nofollow">Robert Bohl</a></b> will be stepping up this year with an ashcan of his punk-rock sci-fi game of teenage rebellion, <i>Misspent Youth</i>.

Is it just that most of you you are/were Forge veterans at loose ends and needed to get together to afford a booth, or was the actual inspiration more personal? I know that the Vincent-Emily-Joshua at least are a pretty logical combo (and you all probably have plenty of prior contacts with each other), so is it just a friends thing? Or do you have some sort of guidelines for what sort of games and designers are featured at Play Collective, perhaps, and the people you have participating just happen to be the ones who are both interested and qualified? I note that your promo materials usually mention independent game design, but is that the actual raison d'etre for the group, or just a happy coincidence?<br><br>Regardless, I'll expect to spend an annoyingly long time visiting your booth.

Last year, we were all expatriates from the Forge/IPR booth. What brought us together is that we all knew and trusted each other, were confident we could talk about and recommend each others game and (very importantly) we all wanted to encourage others and offer any help and information we possibly could. <br><br>A standout for me last year was when Neil Gow came up to the booth and talked about a game he was working on. He was unsure about talking about it, posting about it online and getting feedback on it. But he had a great idea and there was advice and encouragement there for him. He goes home to the UK and what do you know, '<a href="http://www.omnihedron.co.uk/dutyandhonour" rel="nofollow">Duty &amp; Honour</a>' (a great game which is well worth checking out)is almost ready to see the light of day in print form.

IndiePressRevolution.com has those 5 copies. I assume they will bring whatever stock they have to GenCon. But, it's possible they'll sell out by then, or that they won't make the ride since there are so few available currently. <br/><br/>Malcolm's explanation above is correct. The Play Collective will not feature Nine Worlds strictly because it's nearly out of print and I personally have no stock on hand.<br/><br/>I will reprint the book as soon as the Chimera Creative coffers can afford it!
