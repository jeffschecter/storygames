I'll get those out of the way, so as to give some useful feedback.<br/><br/>What we did wrong:<br/>-My players (I GM'd) were not really fans of the genre.<br/>-I didn't have a complete handle on the rules, despite having read it at least twice and having lots of handouts.<br/>-We were there to play Mouse Guard, and not Danger Patrol, so expectations were skewed.<br/>-We didn't get to finish, only playing through the first action scene.<br/><br/>Ok, as I said, these weren't big fans of the genre, so we were all relying on my own enthusiasm for the game and setting. This was pretty tiring as I wasn't getting much back. I mean the players were doing their best, but they simply didn't have the pulp knowledge to constrain their narration and "danger". The did get more into the feel of adding danger, but I didn't describe exactly how threats could be beaten. They had more desire to simply roleplay out awesome stuff, regardless of how it would score hits to those threats. Many times I felt like I had to shoehorn what they were saying into hits somehow. This would sometimes translate to a direct hit, but other times I had to improvise it mechanically; and this was tiring too.<br/><br/>It was really tough to figure out how to use some of their traits. The players were disappointed that they couldn't use traits that they put higher dice in, when it seemed that the fighting and moving ones applied to most of what was going on. <br/><br/>I even with only 3-4 threats, I was losing track of what was going on with applying danger, and I think that my inexperience with the game is the root of most of this. I had a lot of trouble figuring out what constituted a "threat level one below" when flipping back and forth between the threat level list (minor, major, etc) and the threat moves list (danger 1, danger 2, etc). They didn't seem to match up in my head. Maybe better labeling or layout would help me here. <br/><br/>I used three sizes of notecards: full, half, and quarter sized to represent places, threats, and characters respectively. It was still a bit hard to tell what was what sometimes, but I'm a bit slow, so that's probably my issue.<br/><br/>Overall the game felt way too hand-wavy to me, bordering on freeform at times that felt there was no grounding. The rules for adding danger are awesome, but a lot of other things felt way arbitrary for my tastes like assigning 3-5 hits for threat. When we as GM's are allowed to fudge anyways, why not just say 3 hits, and let me fudge if needed? These kind of things pour molasses into my brain. Where the rules did come in, felt like they held us back narratively at times and at other times propelled us forward. <br/><br/>I love this game, John! I'm tearing into it out of love. I definitely want to run it again, and you have no idea how much I'm looking forward to the complete, released game!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267514/#Comment_267514" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-16T13:24:04+00:00" title="April 16, 2010  1:24PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 16, 2010 1:26PM by Ben_Robbins.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a bummer Jesse.
