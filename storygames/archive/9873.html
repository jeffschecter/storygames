Briefly, he says: start several scenes in rapid succession, then cut between them at decision points. Don't let the scene play out before cutting: cut when it's interesting. Then you'll be cutting back and forth between several ongoing scenes.<br/><br/>Then, bring things from one scene into another scene (a Cross). Then there is Weaving itself, another technique like Crossing, which I don't fully understand. It's about building the scenes together to a climax. If someone understands that better than me, do jump in.<br/><br/>My Trail of Cthulhu scenario, The Watchers In The Sky, starts with all the characters separated. One useful technique is to ask players to play NPCs in each other's scenes.<br/><br/>Do you want advice about bringing characters together when they're separated? Because that's easy. Using Crosses, tie the scenes together, and sooner or later there'll be an excuse for the PCs to visit each other. Failing that, just ask the players to decide how their characters come together.<br/><br/>If this post is useful to you, you should probably buy <a href="http://www.sorcerer-rpg.com/product-listing.php?PHPSESSID=65c2c5979867476fc5b4235aa4fbf936" rel="nofollow">Sex and Sorcery</a>, because that's where the advice is from.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219691/#Comment_219691" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-20T17:14:29+00:00" title="July 20, 2009  5:14PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A) Keep scenes short.  Under ten minutes before switching to someone else.  Scenes drag on after that, and seem especially draggy if you're not involved.  Moving th spotlight around helps keep everything fresh.<br/><br/><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> Do stuff that gets players interested in other PCs' scenes.  Having a player play an NPC does this.  So does introducing a PC's significant NPCs in a different PC's scene.  Like: my girlfriend's life in endangered in your scene.  Though my PC is not there, I the player perk up and pay attention to see if she survives the scene.  <br/><br/>C) Allowing the PCs to communicate with one another helps immensely.  It's a game about communication, and the danger in splitting the party is that the game becomes a one-on-one between one player and the GM (if there is a GM), and no one else adds to the game.  more people adding to the game is better, so give the players some input.  In traditional games, this means a way to speak through their character.  In other games, players might have other modes of input.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
