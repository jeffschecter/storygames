Would be interested to see what mini story game/game poem this inspires. If this song doesn't do it for you, would love to still see a game inspired by a song of your choice, just link it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith" title="Keith"><img alt="Keith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/41781_139848736039153_8022_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith">Keith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401366/#Comment_401366" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-20T19:00:33+00:00" title="December 20, 2012  7:00PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Johnny Cash - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJlN9jdQFSc" rel="nofollow">God's Gonna Cut You Down</a><br/><br/>You are a sinner, like all men.

Don't make him a caricature of evil, make him a regular man.  I'm thinking a farmer, something vaguely rural, something vaguely Western.  That's what Johnny Cash makes me think of.  You're just trying to get by, be a good man, a God fearing man, but it's so hard.  You're wicked without trying.<br/><br/>Open to a random Bible verse.  One day, while doing the things you always do, you have violated this verse in an effort to solve one of the many problems that confronts you.  Roll both your dice.  Your numeral die tells you if you were successful in solving your problem: <br/><br/>1-no, and<br/>2-no<br/>3-no, but<br/>4-yes, but<br/>5-yes<br/>6-yes, and<br/><br/>Your pip die tells you how close you are to running out your strand.  If it came up higher than a one, your level of sin has just gone up to two.  Next time you roll the pip die, if it is above two your level of sin goes up to three, and so on.  Also, any time you score a 6 ("yes, and") on your numeral die your level of sin goes up.  You're too prideful, thinking you did all those good works on your own.  You're committing sins without even realizing it, and sooner or later God's gonna cut you down.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith" title="Keith"><img alt="Keith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/41781_139848736039153_8022_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith">Keith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401368/#Comment_401368" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-20T19:09:59+00:00" title="December 20, 2012  7:09PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Men's Recovery Project -<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NgTXsIzfJQ" rel="nofollow"> Clark in My Car</a><br/><br/>Write these words on index cards.

Turn to one of your friends and without accusing him (which would be rude) try to get them to admit to putting the clark in your car.  They will take one of the index cards and explain how they were not putting a clark in your car, they were doing <i>something completely different</i> based on the word on their card, like maybe picking up a crate of bonahr's for your surprise birthday party, or taking their boyfriend out to that new restaurant that serves that killer bahr.<br/><br/>Of course, that rascal <i>may </i>have just picked the clark card!  What then, eh?  Then they <i>lie to you!</i>  They make up their own silly word and use it in their explanation.

Each player should take 6 index cards and on each one jot down one thing that they care about.  It could be a person (child, spouse, parent, friend), an object (house, guitar, car, lucky charm), a place (the mountains, your childhood home, the South of France), or even a concept (truth, freedom, karma).  Next to each thing write down a number from 1 to 6, without duplicating any one of them.<br/><br/>On the backside of each card write down one thing your character wishes they could do.  Try to keep it somewhat vague.  \u201cStand up to my boss\u201d is too specific, but \u201cstand up for myself\u201d is just right.  These should all be things that are within the realm of actual human achievement and useful for someone living a life a lot like yours.  Write the same number on the back of the card that you previously wrote on the front of the card.<br/><br/>Pick someone to play first.  Their day begins the way their day usually begins.  They narrate getting up, brushing their teeth, making breakfast \u2013 whatever the morning routine would be for a character a lot like them.  The other players will wait a minute or two and then introduce a mundane problem.  Your car won\u2019t start, you forgot to buy something to take for lunch, your kid is coughing and sneezing.  The player rolls their die.  If the number on the die matches the number on one of their index cards (and on the first roll it always will), they fail to solve their problem.  The thing on the front of the index card \u2013 that thing they care about \u2013 is preventing them from solving the problem.  Flip that card over.  That thing you cared about before?  It\u2019s not so important anymore.  But now, now you\u2019re able to do that thing on the back of the card, that thing you always wanted to be able to do.  Narrate why you can\u2019t solve your problem and move on.<br/><br/>Example:  Ethan realizes he forgot to fill up his gas tank on the way home from work yesterday.  He thinks that maybe he\u2019ll take his wife\u2019s car to work, instead and she can deal with his low-on-gas automobile.  He rolls his d6 and gets a 5.   The index card with 5 on it says \u201cKids.\u201d  Ethan knows that if his wife has to gas up his car first thing in the morning she\u2019ll be very grumpy and probably take it out on the kids on their way to school.  He flips over that index card and resigns himself to gassing up his car.<br/><br/>If the die rolls a number of an index card that was already turned over, narrate how your new ability allows you to solve the problem.<br/><br/>Example: Later on, Ethan rolls another 5 while trying to unclog a paper jam in that lousy piece-of-crap copier at work that his cheapskate boss won\u2019t buy a replacement for.  The index card that used to tell Ethan that he cares about his kids now tells him that he is able to \u201csay no and have people respect it.\u201d  Ethan narrates how his boss comes by and half-jokingly asks if Ethan managed to break the copier again.  Ethan looks up, locks eyes with his boss and says \u201cNo, it breaks fine on its own because it\u2019s an outmoded piece of equipment that any halfway decently run office would have replaced half a decade ago.\u201d  You tell him, Ethan.<br/><br/>After each failed problem roll, pass the narration to the next PC.  They will begin their day and deal with problems in the same fashion.  Eventually, all your index cards will be turned from the Caring side to the Ability side.  Nothing can stop you now, because you just don\u2019t care.  Congratulations, I guess?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401818/#Comment_401818" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-27T06:42:59+00:00" title="December 27, 2012  6:42AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I got to solo play my "What do you think about while shoveling snow" game yesterday - for real - 10 freaking inches of we snow.

The others at the table play those the Visitor has come into contact with in his life who have passed on, vying for his attention. The Visitor, however, desires to speak with only one of the spirits.<br/><br/>Play begins as the Visitor states the purpose of the visit, by writing upon his paper 'I am seeking____' This can be anything, from reciprocation of a debt or love, to forgiveness and redemption, or even vindication within an argument. It will frame all of the interactions henceforth. Each Spirit then writes their relation to the Visitor on their sheet of paper, and displaying it infront of them.<br/><br/>The second phase is the establishment. In turn, from the left of the Visitor, each Spirit states a truth of their relationship with the Visitor. 'We lived together', 'We used to play in the same football team' or 'You proposed to me' are all possible and reasonable answers here, as would be more specific statements.<br/>At the end of the second phase, the Visitor justifies each truth to each of the spirits at the table by explaining the circumstances within which the truth occurred.<br/><br/>The third phase is Opinion. In turn, from the right of the Visitor, each Spirit states an opinion they have of the Visitor. 'I loved you' 'I as disappointed in you' 'I wished you were there more often' 'You always seemed distant' are all great ones. As play reaches the Visitor, he must justify why each Spirit felt this way towards him, providing context to their feelings.<br/><br/>The final phase is Event. From the left of the Visitor, each Spirit describes an event that occurred between the two that would warrant the Visitor seeking the closure stated at the beginning of the game. As play passes around to the Visitor once more, he must choose the Spirit he was searching for at the beginning, by silently passing his paper towards them.<br/><br/>Play then passes to this individual as they play a new Visitor and the game begins again.<br/><br/>Maybe a bit solemn and moody... But I think it fits.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401903/#Comment_401903" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-28T01:53:38+00:00" title="December 28, 2012  1:53AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 28, 2012 1:54AM by David_Berg.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dig that song, Huckabees.  Here's my take:<br/><br/>All the player characters work in the same hectic, soul-crushing office.<br/><br/>Each character has a Task, a Secret, and a Sign, and two stats (Stress and Satisfaction).<br/><br/>The Task is your job.  If you keep your head down, you will perform this task successfully and remain employed.<br/><br/>The Secret is something about you that is dramatic and interesting, but that your co-workers don't know about.  It should be something in flux that demands attention and action and could benefit from some help.<br/><br/>The Sign is something that your co-workers see every day, that points to your Secret and would get anyone to ask you about it if they only had the time and gave a damn.<br/><br/>Stress starts at 11.  If it hits 20, you're out of the game, either spazzing out or turtling up.<br/><br/>Satisfaction starts at 5.  Whoever has the highest Satisfaction when the game ends is the winner.<br/><br/>Play is about the player characters bumping into each other around the office.  Every player flips a coin.  Whichever result is less common -- heads or tails -- those players are in the scene.  The scene continues until each character either Keeps Their Head Down or Gives a Damn.  When the scene ends, flip again.<br/><br/>When you Keep Your Head Down, subtract 1 from Satisfaction and leave the scene.<br/><br/>When you Give a Damn, play on until you're ready to roll for both Satisfaction and Stress.<br/><br/>Satisfaction roll: 1d6 + however many points the other players grant you based on the fiction.<br/>Stress roll: 1d6 + however many points the other players push on you based on the fiction. <br/><br/>So, we have a bunch of people who are constantly around each other, but are functionally alone, because reaching out could be more than they can handle.  That's the aspect of NYC the song reminded me of, anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
