I liked the system, but my players weren't as keen on "stepping up" to the problems I threw at them during the GM's turn, and they definitely didn't seem to catch on to how powerful they were during the character's turn.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd like to find a game that is low-prep and high on player agency, but still suitable for more than one session.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've been looking at HotB, but I keep waffling on whether I grok it or not, so I am tabling it (again) for now.<br/>\nMy group really enjoys Fiasco, but I want to keep it as our "Not everyone showed" game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to challenge PCs, but I need more practice, and my players do too. I want to ease the players into a "failure is interesting" situation, where they are more interested in creating the story than "winning". <br/>\n<br/>\nI've got 5 players, 2 of who are story-focused, 2 of which are mainly social and could go either way, and 1 gamist who has some confidence issues but he tries.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat should I look into?

Good Front-writing takes time, as does any custom moves you may want to put together. I probably spent an hour per Front initially: 3 Fronts, each with 3 or 4 Threats. After that, hardly any time at all other than daydreaming time.<br/><br/>2) The sex moves are IMO *the* killer app of AW. We found that the mechanics have the effect of distancing the players from the intimacy of characters having sex, which is a prominent component of *most* adult fiction. The very first time two of my players decided to go down that road there were lots of eye-rolls and nervous laughs, and then we got into the mechanics of it, and then it was totally dandy. <br/><br/>One more bonus thought:<br/><br/>3) AW is only as GW as you want to make it. GW is explicitly gonzo in its setting assumptions, while AW is more, I don't know...interested in themes one finds in postapocalyptic fiction. I'm not really sure GW prompts the players to address stuff like desperation and anarchy the same way AW does.<br/><br/>Anyway, good choice and it fits all your criteria (once you get past the Fronts prep).<br/><br/>Other leads for your consideration: <br/><br/>* InSpectres is always a popular choice in these situations. The game's various mechanisms guarantee the players will continue dealing with, even prompt, interesting failures. Good training wheels to get into that head space. Prepless!<br/><br/>* Dust Devils is my personal favorite for high-agency, low-prep, chase-what-you-care-about gaming. Very thin on mechanics but what there is works really well. I can prep a session in under 10 minutes, but I've played a *lot* of it.<br/><br/>* PTA maybe? Although it doesn't really have a challenge-the-PCs kind of dynamic. But it's a classic for a good reason.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312072/#Comment_312072" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-10T11:55:22+00:00" title="February 10, 2011 11:55AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've had to same reaction to the special moves, depending on the group.

All characters are pregenerated.<br/><br/>Players award themselves xp when they behave according to their characters' keys.  That's amazingly empowering and really gets people out of the mother-may-I mode where everything has to be reality-checked with the GM.<br/><br/>The LB ruleset includes great advice for how to judo GM questions about the situation into PC challenges.  <br/><br/>And it plays best over a few sessions, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
