                    So, I killed a few small categories that weren't going anywhere and created some new ones. I'm really gonna have to update the Rules or What is Story Games sticky threads one of these days to track all the little changes I've been making.<br/><br/>Anyway, here's the new stuff:<br/><br/><b>Directed Self Promotion:</b> This is basically where you tell us about your Cool New Shit. I left the description of the category a little vague: I don't want it to fill up with spam or everyone posting their links to their latest blog posts or something like that.  But I noticed that there's enough solid, good promo threads that should thrive here, and just for sensibility's sake I moved a bunch (not all, I went back about 4 pages only) to that category.<br/><br/>So if your game, website, T-Shirt, forum, or Awesome New Thing is ready to share, post it there. I suggest doing so in a way that attracts discussion, but it really doesn't matter too much.<br/><br/>Note that Little Ideas, Gamecraft and Games and Gaming is still the place to go with solid, directed, REAL questions related to your stuff (ex: <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=985&amp;page=1#Item_9" rel="nofollow">This thread on Beast Hunters Art</a>).<br/><br/><b>Best of Story Games</b> Please don't post in this category.  When I get back from vacation and post-GenCon orgasms settle down, I'm going to ask for people to vote for their favorite discussions that are in-line with the goals of this place. I will move top discussions will go in that area. This will probably happen 2 times a year or so. The threads, once moved, can still be posted to and all- They won't get locked or anything.<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>
