                    Arrange six cups in a circle in the center of the table.  Label them with themes or methods or something.  Cups opposite each other should be opposing themes/methods/whatever.  Totally random example:
<table><tr><td align="center" style="width: 50px;"></td><td align="center" style="width: 50px;">Kill</td><td align="center" style="width: 50px;">Wits</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">Terror</td><td colspan="2"></td><td align="center" style="width: 50px;">Calm</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td align="center">Force</td><td align="center">Mercy</td></tr></table>
Each player starts with nine six-sided dice and a blank sheet of paper.<br/><br/>Resolution (Task or Conflict?) requires you to score more successes than your opponent.  You can score successes in one of two ways: investing or rolling.<br/><br/>You invest dice by taking some of your player dice and putting them into a cup.  This scores you a number of successes equal to the number of dice invested minus the number of dice already in the cup.  It also gives you a stat for that pool which you write down on your sheet and has a rating equal to the number of dice you invested.  So if there's one die in the Kill pool and I invest three dice there, I score two successes and gain a stat rated at Kill+3.  Stats can never be higher than 3.<br/><br/>Alternately, I can roll dice that are already in cups.  I can roll some or all of the dice in any cup.  Each die that rolls under three is a success.  If I have any applicaple stats (rolling Kill dice, and I have Giant Gun, Kill+3), I can add one stat to the number I need to roll under.  However, any die that rolls a 1 gets moved to the cup to the left, and any die that rolls a 2 gets moved to the cup to the right.  Any dice that rolled failures are moved to the opposing cup.<br/><br/>The oppposition then invests or rolls to gain successes.  Successes are compared and whoever has the most wins.  In addition to getting their stakes or whatever, the winner may move a number of dice equal to the difference into or out of the cup that he rolled (so if I rolled Kill and won by 2 successes, I can move two dice into or out of the Kill cup).<br/><br/>If you fail and you used a stat, the stat is reduced by the difference and you get that many new dice.  (I used Giant Gun again and lost by 2, so Giant Gun goes down to 1 and I get two new dice)<br/><br/>The idea here is that different methods become more or less effective while at the same time players are invested in specific methods.  Players will end up chasing dice around the six cups, trying to consolidate dice in the cups they are invested in, and so on.<br/><br/>I have no idea what this would actually be useful for, so I throw it out there for general consumption.  Have at.                </div>

                            my immediate response is...<i>baffled yet intrigued</i>. I know that this has got to be useful for something, something cool.  But man, I'd really like to know what.<br/>
<br/>
obviously, the values being chased would have to be something dynamic -- where it makes sense that they'd be constantly in flux.<br/>
<br/>
morality?<br/>
resource management?  (actually, it might make one hell of a stock market game)<br/>
abstracted large scale resolution (say, tracking various factors in a huge battle -- morale, tactics, strategy, etc)<br/>

                            Courtly intrigue perhaps. Where the cups represent various interests.                        </div>
