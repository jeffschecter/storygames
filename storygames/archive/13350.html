I have some ideas on how to challenge Skill and Strength in a conflict, but (as an Outside or Inside Player) how would you challenge a hero's Faith and, especially, Spirit?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example: Faith could be contested when an NPC tries to seduce a hero (fidelity), or when an NPC tries to convince a hero to commit a crime (tradition), but if the hero is defending themselves verbally, wouldn't Strength (outspokenness and general self-esteem, assertiveness) fit better? (I guess I could explain during scene setup that in this case the hero is outspoken enough to defend themselves and this is not the issue of the conflict; the issue at stake is whether their will is strong enough, in which case this becomes similar to Pendragon's emotional traits: roll to see if your character values his chastity enough to spurn the advances of the sorceress).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only two ideas I have for challenging someone's Spirit is:<br/>\na) have a hero loose their way, or even better, have them attempt to find someone who got lost/was kidnapped, and create a conflict around whether they can keep up hope (or love, or passion) long enough to find what they're looking for,<br/>\nb) if a hero is a sorcerer/witch, have the success of their magic rely on the strength of their negative emotions (revenge, jealousy, anger, envy).<br/>\n<br/>\nHas this come up in any games that you played? What conflicts did you run and what pools did you use for them?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nJane                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300883/#Comment_300883" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-15T12:21:00+00:00" title="November 15, 2010 12:21PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Jane/Katarzyna!<br/><br/>In my experience, the process of determining the relevant pool can be pretty organic. Conflicts will emerge and it will either be obvious which pool is involved, or there will be a short discussion:<br/><br/>ME: This is totally a Strength conflict! He's resisting the magical stones!<br/><br/>OUTSIDE GM: Right, he's resisting <i>magic</i>, fool, and that's a Spirit conflict!<br/><br/>Now either could be correct, but after a arguing and negotiating one is chosen by the GM, hopefully without too much consideration of the character's numbers. Many conflicts could be easily assigned to two or even three possible attributes, so it is best to be flexible and go with the most colorful choice in the moment. <br/><br/>My advice, based on playing a bunch, is not to worry too much about which pools will be involved, but rather to create situations (and conflicts) you and your friends are going to find interesting and challenging. The back-and-forth between player and GM about which pool to use is fun and a nice part of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennan_Taylor" title="Brennan_Taylor"><img alt="Brennan_Taylor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennan_Taylor">Brennan_Taylor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300950/#Comment_300950" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-16T03:35:43+00:00" title="November 16, 2010  3:35AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, keep in mind that whichever player sets the scene gets to choose the pool. That means Hero Players choose the pool on their turn, while the Inside or Outside Player chooses it on their turn. Naturally, Hero Players will try to use a big pool on their turn, and the Inside and Outside Players will go for a smaller one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/3Jane" title="3Jane"><img alt="3Jane" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/3Jane">3Jane</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301007/#Comment_301007" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-16T12:08:55+00:00" title="November 16, 2010 12:08PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi guys,<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks for responding so fast! I'm afraid it doesn't help me "get" Spirit and Faith though. They're simply a part of the rules I have problems understanding and I think some examples would help me with that.<br/>\n<br/>\nJason, I can't really discuss with a player which pool would be the most appropriate for a particular conflict if I don't have a good idea about what two of the pools mean in practice.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrennan, this is actually what prompted me to ask for examples. If I were an Inside or an Outside Player and it was my turn to set a scene, how would I target a smaller pool if said pool was Spirit or Faith? (This also applies in reverse: if the largest pool of a Hero character is Spirit or Faith, how would a Hero player set a scene to have it play a large part?) I realise that the answer to this question will always depend on who the characters are and what the village is, but again, examples generate better understanding and allow one to get more and better ideas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_301060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennan_Taylor" title="Brennan_Taylor"><img alt="Brennan_Taylor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennan_Taylor">Brennan_Taylor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301060/#Comment_301060" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-16T17:51:11+00:00" title="November 16, 2010  5:51PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure!<br/><br/>Let's take a look at the list of attributes for both pools:<br/><br/>SPIRIT<br/>For women: Love, Revenge, Jealousy, Joy<br/>For men: Anger, Passion, Tenderness, Envy<br/><br/>I see lots of potential conflicts here. Spirit is the pool of emotion, anything that makes a character run hot can be a Spirit conflict. Try getting a man angry. For both men and women, challenging or threatening someone they love, and certainly jealousy and envy offer up plenty of conflict ideas.<br/><br/>FAITH<br/>For women: Kinship, Tradition, Secrecy, Fidelity<br/>For men: Loyalty, Camaraderie, Tradition, Respect<br/><br/>Conflicts for faith involve community. Tradition is a great one, try to get the characters in a situation where the traditions of the village conflict with what they want to do. Kinship for women is also easy to bring in, threaten family members. For men, loyalty and camaraderie come in when they are working with other men in a team.<br/><br/>Does this help a bit more?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
