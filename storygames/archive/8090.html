As in, "Sick Squid")<br/><br/>It's worth mentioning that everyone pulled together on this project like you wouldn't believe.  After Neil suggested it, it'd been written, edited, laid out and I had the proof copy in my hands within about 10 weeks.   Frankly, bloody amazing.  Almost everyone had a project or article they wanted to put out, and people like having a hardcopy of supplements, so it made sense to collate the whole lot together into one book.  Paul Bourne did the layout and cover, the book looks bloody amazing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig" title="Malcolm Craig"><img alt="Malcolm Craig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/contestedground/UntitledAlbum/photo?authkey=UQZ1oivg8Lc#5239981636020065186"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig">Malcolm Craig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178812/#Comment_178812" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-15T14:26:18+00:00" title="November 15, 2008  2:26PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wolfe</cite>Looks interesting.

I'm keen to have a game where the characters venture out towards that area. I thinkmy own Hot War article is pretty nifty as well. Hopefully it will spur interest and encourage people to find out more for themselves.<br/><br/>Overall, the Journal is an excellent piece of work. The way that everyone pulled together to produce it has been wonderful. With a strong lead from Rich, drawing on the expertise that various individuals have, it all came together quickly and relatively easily. The way that people produced work for the games of others helps illustrate how much of a mutualistic thing the Journal is.<br/><br/>At six quid, there's value in it for everybody.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malc                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick" title="Andrew Kenrick"><img alt="Andrew Kenrick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/145/415482171_321214bd7c.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick">Andrew Kenrick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178874/#Comment_178874" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-16T03:27:24+00:00" title="November 16, 2008  3:27AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It really is a nice looking book, packed with genuinely useful articles - even if you play just one of the games featured, there'll be something in there worth the price of entry.<br/><br/>Malcolm has done me proud with the Dead of Night Fright Sheets he wrote for the Journal - they're a really great spin on a Dead of Night adventure, setting up a spooky location laden with potential for an adventure or three!
