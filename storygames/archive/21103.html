He runs a decades-long game set in Middle Earth, and the group values deep in-character immersion\u2014speaking in-character, physically inhabiting your character and jumping out of your chair and gesturing like your character is gesturing in a kinda chamber larp-ish way, researching things your character would know and bringing that into the game.<br/><br/>They also value knowing your Tolkien cover to cover, and acting without hesitation, and displaying qualities of leadership and, like, wisdom: placing the good of the game-world, their version of Middle Earth, above even personal enjoyment of the game.<br/><br/>The system... looks like it started out as deeply drifted D&amp;D in the 80s, and by this point is basically "Player rolls a d20, Cary glances at it and makes up whatever the heck he wants, and oh yeah there are seven ability scores rated 3-18 and like hit points and skills and stuff I guess". I mean, their combat system seems to have detailed weapon damage, and armor that absorbs damage, and stamina points, and Personal Body Points for several areas of the body... and yet, no round structure or TN to land a blow on your enemy or anything, it's all handled by the conversational flow in a kinda Apocalypse World-like way.<br/><br/>The players seem to nearly worship Cary. Silmenume clearly respects and idolizes him. Another thing this particular table values a lot is player skill: in a game where player skill comes down to knowing what to do and say to get the response you want out of Carey.<br/><br/>Silmenume in particular has thesis about <i>bricolage</i>, how Forge-ite Simulationist play is all about building up the shared imagined space by incorporating whatever you've got on hand\u2014Impronitfol, swerving to create story, in 2097's recent dialectic. In these threads, Ron Edwards is constantly saying stuff along the lines of "This is all illusionist nonsense, you are Cary's emotional prisoner, how can you not see that you are basically a battered spouse." And Silmenume is constantly responding with "You have a point, but we <i>love</i> this game. It is hugely important to all of us. And it's not <i>just</i> illusionist nonsense."<br/><br/>Ron interprets the game's mechanics as Forge-ite Drama, which IIRC is basically the same as Everway Drama: whatever is best for the story (as determined by Carey and cued by the appearances of natural 1s and 20s on the oh-so-frequent d20 rolls) is what happens. And this seems to accord with how Cary describes the game, as relayed through Silmenume: "The dice add spice!" As in, the dice tell you when to shake things up! When to pay attention and build out your world, when to <i>bricole</i>!<br/><br/>It's a hot mess. It's fascinating.<br/><br/>And I want, really really bad, to be a Cary. To have this deep, deep exploration of one huge sprawling world and story, to have a system that really helps us all live in and build out this imaged place, encourages players to really get inside their PCs' skins. But all this shit is tangled up in this one group's cult of personality, and history together, and insecurely attached / semi-abusive social dynamic.<br/><br/>So, yeah. I wanna try and disentangle it all. To extract something useful, and write a game that lays out How To Be Cary, minus the insecure attachment.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462896/#Comment_462896" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-04T06:14:08+00:00" title="May  4, 2017  6:14AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            \u2665<br/><br/>These guys know how to live                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462897/#Comment_462897" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-04T06:30:06+00:00" title="May  4, 2017  6:30AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 4, 2017 8:52AM by 2097.">edited May 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is also an argument for "Transparency of Method"; some of the cockamamie initiative systems I've experiment have been received as if they were as arbitrary as Carey's game.

People still playing in his games usually enjoys more gaming <i>him</i> (as in player skill as described above) and the system (which no matter what he DMs, always end up hacking it in the worst gruesome ways) , and play for the moments described above. At least my friend would have granted players their wishes after a similar exchange, and rewrite his entire campaign once he calmed down and got enough advice on how to exact his revenge from me or other GMs.<br/><br/>He's got a real good sense of scene framing, can get players there. He will never just give you all the details, you've got to wrestle them out of him by interacting with the fiction in the exact way he had planned. He gets carried by his story so he usually ends up making mistakes, introducing weak spots on his rails, that he doesn't notice until it's too late and the players are derailing the scene. Then they will usually wrestle for scene control: the GM firing all his excuse cannons until he's out of ammo and shenanigans ensue; the players firing their own too and calling for shenanigans. Dice rolling becomes the arbiter then and the game keeps going on.<br/><br/>The DM now lives so scared of player derail that most of his beloved NPCs are mary sues, forcing players who seek any agency to minmax and munckin their characters into dysfunctional specialized agency machines instead of actual interesting (or even logic) characters. At least that leaves them with enough weak spots that the GM can exploit to regain agency.<br/><br/>There's some sort of playful resentment going under all this. The GM resent the players for ruining his story now and then, the players resent not having agency, they make fun and humilliate each other when they outmaneuver the other side through reason, excuses or mostly dice, and they all laugh. That's their fun. I personally can't stand it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462918/#Comment_462918" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-04T16:21:28+00:00" title="May  4, 2017  4:21PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Am reading through the third AP now ; it says that there's also some non-AP ("theory") threads\u2026?

The one where:<br/><br/>1. The GM knows what they want to happen!<br/>2. But they don't have the authority to just say, "X happens," so they call for a roll. They plan to say, "X happens, because the dice say so," rather than "X happens, because I say so."<br/>3. And the roll is an extreme result! So they move the goal posts and call for another roll.<br/>4. And get another extreme result! Everyone's yelling and cheering!<br/>5. And the GM caves! They say, "Wow, guys, amazing roll. Y happens!"<br/>6. And then, sometimes, later, when everyone's calmed down, X happens anyway.<br/><br/>I don't think anyone has mentioned it yet in this thread, but there's a point in the Canon of Silmenume where the Dunedain is under attack by vikings and orcs, and a player rolls like half a dozen 20s in a row, and the elves come in to save the day! Awesome!<br/><br/>And then, later, in the houses of healing, it turns out that one of the injured Dunedain was a Black Commando, and murders most of the survivors in their sick bed. That's <a href="/forums/search?Search=%236&amp;Mode=like">#6</a> in action and I think it sucks!<br/><br/>But, heretical as it may be, I kinda like steps 1 through 5. I mean it <i>clearly</i> can produce emotional and intense play experiences, so there's gotta be some merit in there somewhere.<br/><br/><b>So, here is my proposal for The Core Mechanic.</b><br/><br/>As the GM, you may call for your players to roll a d20. Do this a lot. You can do it when nothing much is happening but you want to allow for the possibility that something unexpected might happen. You can do it when a player has their character do something with an uncertain outcome. You can do it when you know what you want to happen, but you don't have the social authority to just say it, you need the dice to back you up.<br/><br/>There's two ways to go from here:<br/><br/><b>The Target Roll</b><br/><br/>Announce a Target Number, which is how high the player needs to roll to Do The Thing. If you want you can set the TN higher than 20: "Not unless you roll me two 20s in a row!"<br/><br/>Either it should be manifest and clear to everyone at the table what The Thing is, or it can be <i>manifest and clear to just you</i>. But if it's all in your head, you need to commit. You need to lock that down.<br/><br/><small>(Now, Cary wouldn't lock it down all the time. Cary might move the goal posts after the roll. But that's an element of his style I want to excise. I want to keep the "Fuck you, that's impossible, only on a natural 20" bit, minus the "just kidding only on two natural 20s and a 12% roll and a coinflip" bit.)</small><br/><br/>If the d20 is equal or above TN, It Happesn; if lower, It Does Not. If they miss the TN by a point or two, you can throw them a bone, soften the impact a bit.<br/><br/>And on a natural 1 Fate Is Turning, on a natural 20 that's a Critical Success.<br/><br/><b>The Impression Roll</b><br/><br/>Don't announce a TN or anything. Just hold in your mind <i>what will probably happen</i>. The most likely, most obvious outcome. As above, you gotta be honest with yourself, you gotta lock it down in a way that Cary never would.<br/><br/>You don't have to tell the players what this most likely, expected, obvious outcome is, but <i>they should have a pretty good idea</i> a lot of the time. Either because they've been in situations like this before, and you are consistent in your judgments; or because it's manifest and obvious ("I'm a well-traveled ranger going through woods that are practically my back yard"), or because you've just had an exchange where they attempt to clarify in-character, or you just tell them in-character, how the land lies.<br/><br/>So:<br/><br/>1. Fate Is Turning<br/>2-3. The worst logical outcome that follows directly from the established fiction.<br/>4-7. Worse than expected; adjust down from your pre-committed outcome.<br/>8-13. Exactly as expected; use your pre-committed outcome.<br/>14-17. Better than expected; adjust up from your pre-committed outcome.<br/>18-19. The best logical outcome that follows directly from the established fiction.<br/>20. Critical Success<br/><br/><b>Critical 1s and 20s</b><br/><br/>These are super important. Players should shout about them, gloating in joy or cowering in fear. They're cues for the GM to make sudden and dramatic things happen. They're a grant of authority to go beyond established scope and really fuck with the scene an d story.<br/><br/>On a natural 1, Fate Is Turning. This usually means Something Really Bad Happens, often something that doesn't follow directly from the established fiction. The Looming Threat comes crashing down and totally fucks you up. Or a totally new, heretofore unknown threat reveals itself.<br/><br/>This isn't always all bad, often it's an out-of-the-frying-pan-into-the-fire deal. You escape from the thing you were trying to escape from, but here's this new obstacle!<br/><br/>And, it can mean that you just straight up get what you want... <i>for now</i>. But fate is still turning. And your next d20 throw might not mean what you think it means. Like when Turandir slipped his bonds and got away from his Orc captors, and Elrohir tossed him his blade Gurthang, and figures were running towards him so he swings! ... and cuts down four of his allies in his disorientation and confusion.<br/><br/>On a natural 20, that's a Critical Success! Roll again! See if you get more than one 20 in a row! A critical success is always an amazing success, but two or three in a row can totally change what a scene is about. Here comes the cavalry! Four or more in a row can be cues to the GM to introduce stuff that changes the whole game.<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>So. The mechanic is "The GM decides what they want to happen, or are willing to let happen, and the player rolls a d20. And then the thing probably happens."<br/><br/>But in order to be a Virtuous Cary rather than a Sinful Cary, we've got an extra layer of being honest with ourselves, an extra commitment that before the dice hit the table, we must know in our heart of hearts that it is the TRUTH that X is the most likely result. And if the dice say so, we need to abandon X. It's time to swerve.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462951/#Comment_462951" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-04T22:32:28+00:00" title="May  4, 2017 10:32PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Commenting upon the systemic parts of this phenomenon, I've done some similar things over the last few years in my game design. Not the fiat illusionism part, but rather the part where task resolution rolls "don't matter" or matter in very narrow ways for conflict resolution purposes. It's totally legit game design to decide that you want your game to have task resolution procedures even if they don't actually contribute to resolve anything that actually matters plot-wise to the game; the task resolution can still be important for color or pacing or something.<br/><br/>(RPG theory old-timers might remember at this point that I've got my own pet theory about how task and conflict resolution systems actually interrelate in rpgs - it's not as simple as "you gotta choose one or the other", and there are plenty of games where these simple labels mostly just mislead analysis. So this is me harping about old theory bullshit from last decade.)<br/><br/>The way I see it, the system of this kind of "GM fiat with dice" game can be analyzed as a combination of two overlapping resolution systems:<br/><br/><b>Task resolution:</b> If you're doing something risky or interesting or whatever, the GM will ask you to roll the dice so we'll see how well you do it. You can trust the dice to tell you how well you do, and in fact you can pretty much interpret them yourself most of the time. The GM reliably gives you this - you roll good, your character really does the deed.<br/><br/><b>Conflict resolution:</b> The GM decides what happens in the game (who wins and who loses at different times), but they need to be sort of covert about it, so they'll need to run the task resolution show-and-tell for a little while before laying down the law. The proceedings may even inspire them to improvise a bit. Individual tasks do not ultimately matter, except as narrative wrinkles.<br/><br/>The useful part in breaking things down in this way, for me at least, is that I can peel things away more cleanly and consider them in isolation: does the idea of having a task resolution system <i>without it being super important</i> strike my fancy, perhaps? Or do I like the idea that the GM does covert conflict resolution without telling the players? I feel it's easier to figure out what I want when I think of the perhaps mystifying task resolution rituals and the overall dramatic control system of the game as separate things altogether.<br/><br/>As an example of how one can mix and match task and conflict resolution, perhaps in ways that were out of conceptual reach during the golden era of the Forge, consider this simplified snippet of rules from a little game I wrote last fall. It's relevant here because it's very similar to what Jeff describes above.\n<blockquote>Whenever characters do task resolution stuff, roll a die against the table:<br/><br/><b>1</b> Failure, plus you're "sidelined" - penalty to further rolls in the situation<br/><b>2-3</b> Normal failure in the task, the situation proceeds without you for now.<br/><b>4-6</b> Success; you're "on the roll" and gain a bonus to further rolls in the situation<br/><b>7+</b> Conflict resolution: you succeed, plus your success rolls over so thoroughly that the entire situation on hand resolves in your favour. Everybody stop rolling until a new situation develops.</blockquote>\n(The game uses multiple die sizes against that table and so on, but all that's ancillary to the point so let's skip the details.)<br/><br/>As you can see, the central conceit of this particular game combines task and conflict resolution rather seamlessly: you're supposed to roll dice for tasks, and if those tasks should happen to resolve a situation, then all well and good; however, it is likely that a more extensive and complex situation will sooner or later end in some participant rolling high enough to outright resolve the situation in a conflict resolution sense.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462952/#Comment_462952" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-04T22:34:50+00:00" title="May  4, 2017 10:34PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, I've seen you express that sentiment before (perhaps even on the linked Forge threads?) but I can't agree.

I think they're cues towards valence, pacing, and scope, which are all bound up in each other. I think some of what you wrote is getting at that, but as you predicted the task / conflict resolution vocab is just obfuscating.<br/><br/><b>Valence:</b> When the players at the table see the roll, does that make them excited? Does it make them expect good things or bad things? The GM must adjust their move to match the reaction that the little piece of plastic provokes in the group, or they'll lose credibility and erode their own authority.<br/><br/><b>Pacing:</b> Does a critical result tell the GM it's time for a sudden shift in the momentum of the scene? Or, I've got some big thing in mind, something that would make the players balk if I just up and said it as part of the conversation\u2014so I'll wait until I see a 1 or a 20 on the table, then slap that baby into the shared fiction while everyone's prepared to be unprepared!<br/><br/><b>Scope:</b> Does a really high or a really low roll prompt the GM to "think bigger" than the expected outcome that they'd had in mind?<br/><br/>And I want to emphasize: this kind of mechanic, this "Roll a d20!", <i>does not always relate to a task or conflict</i>. Like Silmenume wrote in ages past, "About half the time we don't know what we are rolling for." I think this is the GM just fishing for these cues. And I think, other times, you can call for a roll when a character isn't, like, trying to accomplish anything difficult, isn't in conflict, but just kind engaging with the world: making their way through the woods, having a conversation with an NPC.<br/><br/><b>Player:</b> "Alright, I head back to the homesteader's farm. I'll take a shortcut through the wood."<br/><b>GM:</b> "Throw me a d20!" <i>(Holding the expected result, 'You get there with no problem.')</i><br/><b>Player:</b> Crap! Natural 1!<br/><b>GM:</b> <i>(Swerving)</i> "About two thirds of the way there, you come across several footprints\u2014a band of orc. The prints are fresh. What do you do?"<br/><br/>Or, using it kinda like an OD&amp;D reaction roll:<br/><br/><b>Player:</b> "I step out into the road and hail the rider. 'What news?'"<br/><b>GM:</b> "Roll!" <i>(Holding the expected result, 'The rider exchanges a few words and rides on.')</i><br/><b>Player:</b> 19!<br/><b>GM:</b> <i>(Adjusting upwards)</i> "He leaps off his horse and bows. When he raises his visor you can see it's one of your vassals."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462966/#Comment_462966" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-05T01:04:41+00:00" title="May  5, 2017  1:04AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a> I don't remember ever reading how the players reacted to Cary dealing out damage / consequences to their characters\u2014in D&amp;D or something, the GM can easily fall back to "The monster gets this many attacks at +X which to YdZ damage", but, like, Cary is just making it up.

Whatever method Cary used, he used the same method time after time.  <br/><br/>Whenever the dice were consulted, degree did communicate something to the players.  Quality of effort (how high you rolled) + inherent difficulty of situation = severity of GM response, so players got to read the situation accordingly.  I dunno if dice were rolled for damage, but if they were, then I assume their results expressed that logic.<br/><br/>EDIT: The thing I just described is basically the situation-dependence of your Target Roll (i.e. some efforts are easier than others) crossed with the gradations of your Impression Roll (i.e. some successes/failures are closer than others).  Combine those and I think the system you put forth is very close to what the group did.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462971/#Comment_462971" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-05T05:17:10+00:00" title="May  5, 2017  5:17AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 5, 2017 5:32AM by David_Berg.">edited May 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A few core dynamics which I think bear exploring if one were to systematize this:<br/><br/>1) The GM is the arbiter of "what would happen in this simulation", but "what would happen" is highly subjective and filtered through the lens of creativity, entertainment, consistency, tone, celebration of the source material, etc.  My odds to land my grappling hook are improved by practical stuff like picking a good target to latch onto, but I think they're also improved by callbacks to prior play, earnest character expression, Middle Earthy verisimilitude, etc.  This can be an odious experience when the player and GM are not on the same page, and an amazing one when they are on the same page.<br/><br/>Silmenume described the formation of the group to me as a process of finding out over time who could get on the same page.  Those who couldn't weren't invited back.<br/><br/>2) Formal rewards.  Player ratings, best player, wisdom checks, level advancement.  +2 to everything for the rest of the night.  These are great feedback tools for the GM to show the players what the GM values, but also sound to me like weighty social cudgels to wield.  Doing this the Good way rather than the Bad way seems crucial.<br/><br/>3) The main reason I see to listen to Ron's harsh critique of people having a great time is the spotlighting process.  "Delight the GM in order to succeed in character" is one thing, but "delight the GM in order to meaningfully participate as a player" is another, IMO.  As Silmenume described it to me, there was zero, "Oh no, I tried to play but got shot down, I'm sad," going on, but I'm not sure how they got to that point.  I imagine there was some other sort of positive experience going on in those moments of being ignored by Cary -- maybe daydreaming aloud to entertain yourself, or maybe adding color to the scene for the other players?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462972/#Comment_462972" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-05T06:03:36+00:00" title="May  5, 2017  6:03AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's super interesting that consequence-dealing was applied consistently, using the same rules every time. It sounds like it was a hard (but high) limit circumscribing the GM's authority: the GM can only do <i>this much</i> to a PC before giving the players a chance to respond.<br/><br/>(Though maybe this isn't really much of a limit at all, given how deadly the game seems; we see many examples in the Canon of characters, even powerful characters, dropping with a single blow. So maybe it's just so much more illusionism. "See, I'm being fair! Whenever I arbitrarily apply damage to you, it uses this known probability distribution!" Except that known distribution has a 60% chance of one-shotting you, and THEN the GM gets to hand out second chances and Hero's Saving Throws and all that if they're feeling generous.)<br/><br/>The other limit on the GM's authority is the way player credibility gets stretched by a really, really good dice roll producing a bad in-fiction outcome. (But, again, we see the bullshit illusionism where the GM circles back around after the players have cooled down and re-inserts the thing they originally wanted to happen, just a bit delayed.)<br/><br/>How much is it necessary to stiffen up those constraints to get functional play? Or do you just need to kinda explicate the ways in which they are squishy and malleable, put it up front so it becomes part of the social contract rather than bullshit?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462976/#Comment_462976" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-05T07:49:18+00:00" title="May  5, 2017  7:49AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Cary's game there were two damage types; Stamina and PBP (personal body points or "meat points" \u2190 that's not their word for it, they called it PBP).

In Feng Shui 1 (haven't read 2 yet) normally you make a to-hit roll and a damage roll. But there is an enemy type ("Mooks") where you don't need to make damage rolls or even track damage, they don't have HP, you only need a sufficiently high to hit roll to take them out -- so they could possibly take many hits, if the margin of success isn't enough.<br/><br/>In a hypothetical 1s-and-20s game, not sure if this is exactly how Cary's game works or not, when you're fighting an orc, you roll for each swing and narrate the swing vividly.  "Clang!" roll, "Clang!" roll etc. Soon enough, you'll hit a 1 or a 20 (birthday-paradoxically enough it usually happens pretty soon\u2014after four swings, you're already over \u2153 chance of having hit a 1 or a 20, and after ten swings you're at 65% (unfortunately there's a bit of a long tail of diminishing returns going on)); so the battle pace goes like this: fluff, fluff, fluff, fluff, CRUNCH! (5e instead uses hit points as this "pacing mechanic".)<br/><br/><br/>Obv if you get good at the math (and I'm realized I'm not as good at this stuff as I thought) you could tweak the numbers to better suit your game.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462983">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462983/#Comment_462983" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-05T09:59:46+00:00" title="May  5, 2017  9:59AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Side note: in those "fluff"-beats, you're fictionally positioning yourself in the SIS, and in the "crunch" beats you're doing the same but significantly more impactfully.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462987/#Comment_462987" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-05T10:56:58+00:00" title="May  5, 2017 10:56AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I understand how it works.

Everybody's moved on to a less tumultous style of discourse since then, Ron included, but he ever had, and still does, a powerful passion for the gaming art. Delightful how unafraid he was then about putting down an analysis as he sees it.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, I personally think that <i>Dread</i> is a very interesting game that explores a kind of design that has not had as much follow-through as it deserves. Dread and <i>Dead of Night</i>, those are my two guideposts towards a particular kind of GM-expressive gaming; for years I've tended to play a session or two per year of their particular brand of GM-ful horror sim story game, and I know that when the time's right, I'm going to push that stuff further: there's gaming to be had in that style, even if the trad adherents of the "charismatic GM" school of thought seem to have proven impotent in putting it all into an actionable game text.<br/><br/>The "Cary's game" discussed here relates to that inspiration in the most important core factor: we're talking about a game that gets its creative core impulse from the GM's theatrical vision. Whatever of interest and worth is in the given session of play, it is there because the GM brought it; the players do not have that responsibility or that credit. I think that this is an interesting set-up, speaking in general terms: in the aforementioned two scenario horror games I can feel this creative contract lift me and motivate me, as I know that it is on me to bring my best literary effort to the table as the GM. If the game ends up being a shallow and stupid geek fantasy thing, that's because I failed to bring a grander vision. That sort of thinking can take you quite a long way in terms of getting something interesting done at the game table, and I think that at least these horror one-shot games manage to keep it all creatively healthy in a way that a long-running fantasy campaign may not. So it's proven that it's possible; the question is merely who will push this kind of game further, and how.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463000/#Comment_463000" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-05T16:02:26+00:00" title="May  5, 2017  4:02PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right, we're not here to re-hash Forge analyses and arguments. The links up top are there primarily as a canon of Silmenume's experience, the rest of the threads are kinda ancillary, except insofar as they draw out more primary source comments on the game.<br/><br/>So, slot machines and personal charisma, yeah.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">@Potemkin</a> I get the sense from your comments that your stance is there's nothing going on here outside of the charismatic GM, the players are his audience to be manipulated and strung along, and their characters clay in his hands or at best a sort of random generator of prompts for him to build off of. I think that's pretty unfair.<br/><br/>The audience pressure and expectations of the players are <i>real</i>. The GM's need to avoid stretching their authority beyond its limits is a real social constraint, its interplay with the dice and with player decisions is tangible. The GM isn't just doing whatever he wants, he's doing whatever he wants within those constraints.<br/><br/>Sometimes he stretches it pretty far. <i>But not all the time</i>, only when there's some outcome he's super committed to, like the decimation of the Dunedain. And in those situations, player choices and the dice mostly matter in terms of illuminating a path to the end-point. But a lot of the time it seems like he's not holding onto any outcome so strongly. And in those situations, player choices and rolls are very much influencing both the path and the destination.<br/><br/>Like, none of this is really so far from Apocalypse World, right? This is a game where the players and the GM begin and end with the fiction. This is a game where the players, always, and the GM sometimes, plays to find out what happens. This is a game where we never speak the name of our move, and turns are determined by the natural ebb and flow of conversation. This is a game where a natural 1, or a miss on the d20 by a large margin, authorize the GM to make a move, as hard or as soft as he likes. This is a game where we deal Harm as established.<br/><br/>There is definitely something to be salvaged here. I might try to write out the Agenda and Principles and Moves of this game *World style, I think that could help clarify the conversation. (But I'm about to go camping, so maybe on Monday.)<br/><br/>I think the charismatic GM and slot machine endorphin-cannon are obscuring just how functional and coherent of a core you've got lurking underneath the surface, here. I mean, this is an incredibly <i>natural</i> way to play RPGs, it's what mediocre D&amp;D DMs find themselves drifting towards all the time... but it works out poorly, because it's not what the players signed up for and nobody's made it explicit. But the very magnetism, the very gravity, of this style of play just cries out for someone to scrape off the cruft and bare the core in a clear and concise way, so that we can examine it as its own beast, and not as the vestigial appendage of a charismatic leader.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463001/#Comment_463001" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-05T17:09:30+00:00" title="May  5, 2017  5:09PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me, it wasn't so much what the criticism was, as how it was delivered.

Charisma isn't a must if you tone down both the requirements (above 15 instead of 20, you get to add any bonuses you can talk the GM into) and the punishment (ok, you rolled a one, now roll to confirm something terrible, uh you rolled another one roll to confirm stupid death) (and of course all damage is rolled when pertinent, like when the boss is at full HP and confirmed critical happens. If it's at 5hp from dying or 25% of HP then killed outright, no need for confirmation)<br/><br/>On top of that you can use the power of Illusionism for good!<br/><br/>But then again, all this does is just to change the GM requirement from being high CHA to high WIS. You can add unseen mechanics and change the requirement to high INT. Or you can make mechanics simpler, more open and distribute the responsibilities. There are lots of options now, everyone should be free to try whatever they want.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463121/#Comment_463121" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-08T03:49:33+00:00" title="May  8, 2017  3:49AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> Do you have Kang War links?

Rules will come right after this exchange to help decide outcomes and adjudication. Then these get turned into consequences that restart the cycle back again.<br/><br/>Cha could also mean a bit of Cary in the way of projecting life into the characters and description, by making the whole fiction care and react emotionally to the PCs. Perhaps a more actor stance towards the GMing.

It's a form of suspension of disbelief, I guess; the players must know that no human can be totally objective, but they at least for the duration of the session allow themselves to think that the GM has Somewhere They're Going With This, that it's better to give them the Benefit Of The Doubt.<br/><br/>Which of course doesn't always work out well. A lot of us have played with, or been, abusive GMs at some point. Trust is earned, it's often impossible to just give it blindly.<br/><br/>I think "Give the GM the benefit of the doubt until the session is over" is actually a core technique of this sort of play, and one of the things that unites Cary Solomon's and Todd Furler's styles.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" title="ValyrianSteelKatana"><img alt="ValyrianSteelKatana" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463329/#Comment_463329" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-14T02:44:16+00:00" title="May 14, 2017  2:44AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            GMing is more of an art than a science, which is where Wisdom comes into play.

Know what all the rules are and when to bring them into play. Create new and exciting material, reincorporating details from long-ago sessions, and keep it all in your mind at once, to be able to tie together plotlines and develop, new interesting directions with exciting twists.<br/><br/>Wisdom: The ability to observe the players and feed off their reactions. Sense when they need more of something and when they need less of something. Be able to adjust to your particular group of players, learning how much time they need to talk, how much description they need, and when they need to take a break. Figure out who should sit next to whom for maximum effect. Know when to discard the rules or introduce new ones.<br/><br/>Charisma: Draw the attention of your players, both personally and 'inside' the story/fiction. Embody living, breathing, memorable NPCs and produce a "hypnotic" effect on the players. Share your enthusiasm and passion in a way that they can't help but get drawn into the game. Create a "vibe" by bringing illustrations, playing music or sound effects, and choosing just the right lighting for your session. When difficult moments occur in play, you have the ability to talk your way over and through them, making the group feel like that hiccup never even happened, through sheer force of personality.<br/><br/>There's probably a parallel to being a game designer in all that somewhere...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463451/#Comment_463451" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-19T01:13:24+00:00" title="May 19, 2017  1:13AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 19, 2017 1:15AM by Paul_T.">edited May 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As for the "Spicy Roll" itself, there's something really kind of primitive and basic about it, isn't there? The idea of consulting a die roll as an extension of your ability to sense the flow of fate and throw your oar into it... not too different from buying a lottery ticket or asking someone to read your future. From that perspective, it makes sense that you *wouldn't want to know* how it works, or whether it works consistently. Buying into the excitement and the uncertainty is paramount - <i>that's the whole point</i>, to dip into the unknown.<br/><br/>For those in the know, consider the patented "diceless die system" in Metascape II! That's exactly what this is about, isn't it?\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/MentalWinds" rel="nofollow">MentalWinds</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Slay the Proverbial Dragon in one Blow- The main die system is perhaps the most advanced ever made. So what? Well, it allows any roll to have a chance of success or failure. So, the proverbial dragon can be slain in one blow. Or, the mighty warrior may fail to slay a mouse. Roll results range from 1 to infinity, though the largest recorded was several million (not bad given a base roll of about 20)! This is a true, open ended die system.</p></div></blockquote>\n(From <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/9026/game-designers-give-up-youve-been-outdone/p1" rel="nofollow">HERE</a>.)<br/><br/>That's an interesting way to look at it, because when I think back to my early game design efforts, it was all about finding the right dice to get a certain *feeling* when rolling them. A homebrew version of D&amp;D I wrote used different mechanics for different types of actions, because maybe rolling a d20 felt good for attacking someone, but - of course! - watching a growing pile of d6s was way cooler for a chase. (Right?)<br/><br/>I was really in love with WEG Star Wars d6 for a while, where you roll pools of d6s, but the pool has a "wild die". The "wild die" would create dramatic successes and failures, with open-ended rolls on the positive end. The excitement when someone rolls a 6 and a 6 and another 6... wow! Did you just roll a 54 on those 3d6?!?<br/><br/>I loved the drama of it all. No doubt, at the time, we used it as a "spicy roll", and so those dramatic open-ended results were really key. We were all committed, as players and GMs, to making the difference between rolling a total of 20 and rolling a total of 30 *really matter*, even if the target number had been an 8.<br/><br/>Interesting memories to reconsider.

It's something at least I use a lot in this style, though I don't know if it will work for the canon<br/><br/>What I mean is that there are times when you as a GM are undecided on something. As whimsical and railroading as a spicy dice roll GM can be, there are times when she wants to be a bit more fair, leaving things to chance. So you pick up the dice and tell yourself "based on players decisions/NPC plans there are four things that can happen, let's roll to see where things may go". You can also do this in several rolls, walking through the forking path of possibilities in your head and letting the dice choose left or right on each bifurcation. And so, you end up with a twist you could never come up with on your own, trying to connect the missing parts as either a devilish grin forms in your face or you go white pale on realization.<br/><br/>Well, this can be extended to dice rolled by players even while they are rolling skill checks or attacks. Using this you won't only read the dice in binary as if the PC passed a test or not, or even adding how well she fare, but using them as an oracle to tell which of many consequences that could have happened comes to be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463458/#Comment_463458" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-19T19:28:11+00:00" title="May 19, 2017  7:28PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That reminds me of a trick mentioned here from time to time.

mind. The die rolls threw in twists and complications, and all kinds of unusual and unexpected situations would come up.<br/><br/>* However, over the <i>long term</i>, the effects evened out somewhat. Even though the die rolls inspired some unexpected events, it was always my interpretation of the events, and that tended - consciously or unconsciously - towards certain types of stories and outcomes.<br/><br/>That's eventually what drove me away from that style of play: when I switched to using rules which more concretely put outcomes and possibilities into the players' hands, the games went in so many different directions!<br/><br/>When I was GMing "spicy roll" style, it *felt* like play was open and exploratory... it was only when I switched to other procedures of play that I could see how predictable and monotone our games had been up to that point. Despite lots of surprises here and there along the way, the general shape of events, stories, and character arcs were all fairly similar. That's why I've never gone back to it, either - I prefer to be surprised by the outcomes of the story as much as the players.<br/><br/>I think that, at this point in my life, I would be very curious to be a *player* in a such a game again, however, if it was with a GM I trusted (it would have to be someone familiar with this kind of thinking/analysis, I think, and open to discussing it before or after the game).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463460/#Comment_463460" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-19T19:41:04+00:00" title="May 19, 2017  7:41PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just getting caught up on this, but something about this doesn't work for me.  Maybe it's a dependency on "GM charisma" maybe it's illusionism, maybe it's the fact that it does kindof feel like, as Potemkin says, a "skinner box." There's something rotten at the core of this idea for me.  It feels deceptive.  It feels dirty.  It feels underhanded.<br/><br/>Fundamentally, the idea of "You rolled a 20! So something good happens! Or the GM just makes you roll again because 20 isn't good enough by itself." is... very unpleasant to me.  The whole thing feels like a lie, because the dice aren't really placing any kind of constraint on the GM at all, and a sufficiently clever GM can easily avoid any "social pressure" that might flow from his decisions.   Yes, all this assumes "bad intent" on the part of the GM, but I'm having trouble finding any reason why you would use a system like this with good intent except, perhaps for "not knowing any better." (aka "It's 2006")  And clearly I'm not alone here in having reservations about this method - one doesn't talk about needing to "salvage" something or use statements like "there's gotta be some merit in there somewhere." about things that seem good.<br/><br/>Maybe I just don't get this at all?  What WM describes in his last post is clearly the "Disclaim decision making" of Apocalypse World and Blades in the Dark's Fortune Rolls, but it also seems pretty far removed from where this discussion started.<br/><br/>Maybe the "something good" we should salvage from this is just Vincent Baker's "Sometimes, disclaim decision making."?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463461/#Comment_463461" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-19T20:30:53+00:00" title="May 19, 2017  8:30PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I think it's all of that, but also some other things.<br/><br/>For some, it might be a lot of nostalgia, too - this is the way many of us learned to play in the first place, and had some memorable experiences doing so.<br/><br/>The apparent transparency is appealing to some, too: just imagine things and make decisions as your character, and enjoy the ride! From the GM position, it's the total control, I suppose, which is also a draw.

It's mainly the tradition of obfuscation and misleading statements that would drive me away from a game like this, and I've never seen one in this vein which didn't also draw from that culture of play.<br/><br/>From that perspective, the linked thread to Todd Furler's convention games is really fascinating, since it's quite transparent about its methods and procedures, without trying to mislead the players about what their role is in the game.<br/><br/>Also, for me, simply knowing that the person running the game is aware of these concerns and is knowingly choosing this style of play - not by default, because they don't know what else to do - could be enough for me to be willing to trust them and "get on the train".<br/><br/>It would be interesting to see how that experience would feel for me now, if I were to try.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" title="ValyrianSteelKatana"><img alt="ValyrianSteelKatana" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463468/#Comment_463468" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-20T01:26:40+00:00" title="May 20, 2017  1:26AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A brief anecdote on how not to do the spicy dice roll:<br/><br/>Once upon a time, I played a game at a convention that was altogether-not-quite-exactly a reasonable facsimile of AD&amp;D. It was the GM's system of his own making, and it was clearly fantasy heartbreaker territory of the old school variety. The difficulties of the dice rolls were obscured from players, and instead we were to roll 2d6 occasionally, the GM consulting a mysterious difficulty matrix.  More often than not, the GM would call for rolls, and they would pass or fail on a whim. I do believe lower was better; I recall "boxcars" being bad.<br/><br/>The adventure was almost stupendously on rails: walk up a mountain, investigate a cabin in the woods, fight some cultists. Attempts to approach the encounter intelligently--that would be in a manner other than "kick-in-the-door"--were stymied by these occultic rolls and tables. Occasionally, the DM would allow us a hint of success, describing something as happening in response to our efforts, yet these were the equivalent of billboards viewed from the passenger seat. There is the interstate, the car traveling along it, and the attractions that are advertised as located on an exit that will never come.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463469/#Comment_463469" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-20T03:48:43+00:00" title="May 20, 2017  3:48AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 20, 2017 3:50AM by David_Berg.">edited May 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the main flaw with "GM in total control" has generally been murkiness about the player role.  <br/><br/><i>If the GM makes everything turn out the way they want, then what are the players there for?  </i><br/><br/>I'd be down to try any game which answers that question in an interesting way.  <br/><br/>If I'm that GM, I'd want the players to:<br/>- attend and try to connect to the thing I'm enthused about<br/>- inspire me with character actions in sync with that enthusiasm<br/>- react in character to my unfolding events with passionate acting<br/>- speculate aloud about what the story so far really means and what's behind the scenes<br/><br/>In exchange I'd be happy to try to tailor my plot to their interests in the initial conception stage.<br/><br/>If everyone in a group could enthusiastically get on board for this arrangement, I imagine the results would be spectacular, possibly in a similar way to the best aspects of Silmenume and Cary's game.<br/><br/>P.S.

In the wild I think we've all observed it used to keep a game on the rails; it certainly makes it easy for a GM to bamboozle the players and obfuscate whether there are tracks here; but it doesn't <i>have</i> to indicate rails.<br/><br/>In the canon, it seems like Cary was laying tracks only some of the time, and most of the time was genuinely playing to find out what happens. And canonically it seems like the GM would sometimes abandon their intended path and destination, or abandon the path only and come to the destination from a very different angle. So in that style, the player's choices really do always matter\u2014always for the path, usually for the destination. "I fought bravely, but in the end the city fell" and "I was overwhelmed and fled, and the city fell" are very different contributions to the myth.<br/><br/>It doesn't seem like Tod Fuller would ever abandon his plot, though; but the two GMs look like very different beasts despite a few shared principles. (Or maybe I just haven't read as much about his games.)<br/><br/>When I try to run my spicy game, I think I'll aim for a low rate of rail roading, probably only using it to introduce situations rather than bring them to conclusions.<br/><br/>Things I'd want the players to do:<br/><br/>- Care about the Myth. Ingest it, digest it, and spew their actions back into it.<br/>- Have relationships with bit of the Myth that they want to build upon or change.<br/>- Display wisdom and leadership when the Myth rides on their actions and decisions.<br/>- Learn about the stuff their character would know, bring that to the game.<br/>- Engage with the imagined space from a first-person perspective.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463473/#Comment_463473" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-20T14:59:28+00:00" title="May 20, 2017  2:59PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 20, 2017 3:16PM by David_Berg.">edited May 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like that list too!<br/><br/>Agreed that the GM powers we've been discussing needn't indicate a railroad specifically.  The GM might very well choose to play to find out much of the time.  (I do think the <i>ability</i> to railroad is implied, though.  It's hard for me to imagine a GM adopting this style without <i>ever</i> wanting to steer.)<br/><br/>I also agree that the story is largely in the coverage rather than just the cliff's notes: "I fought bravely, but in the end the city fell" and "I was overwhelmed and fled, and the city fell" are meaningfully different play experiences for sure!  The group just needs to be on the same page about where the fun lies, rather than (e.g.) the players looking for it in the things they <i>can't</i> control (e.g. <i>every</i> destination).  <br/><br/>I think a lot of the historical trouble with this style of play is that the things that are up to the players and the things that aren't often look the same.  Which NPCs can I potentially kill, and which NPCs are protected by the GM for plot reasons?  Having the GM bullshit some reason why your die roll doesn't count is a crappy way to experience the difference.  In order for Cary's totally subjective difficulty-setting to be embraced, the group needs to be thoroughly on board with the idea that the game mechanics give them <i>no promises</i>.  Their path for interacting meaningfully with play is to go through the GM, not through the rules and dice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463474">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463474/#Comment_463474" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-20T17:18:52+00:00" title="May 20, 2017  5:18PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 20, 2017 5:20PM by Jeph.">edited May 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The canonical play seems to kinda rely on players' inability do distinguish between what they can and can't influence, unfortunately. I don't think I'm cut out for that kind of thing; I'm too conditioned to hold onto things lightly.<br/><br/>Like, in the-dwarf-and-the-evil-druid story 2097 quoted way up at the top of the thread, if I were the GM, my opening would've been, "You're going to need better than just a natural 20." And when the player rolled two 20s in a row, I'd be like, "Holy crap, roll 3d6 for critical damage!" And then I'd compare whatever they rolled to the evil druid's known hit point total, and describe the appropriate wound.<br/><br/>So I think I want something slightly softer than "There are no promises."<br/><br/>Maybe:<br/><br/>1. The GM never has to give you a chance. They never have to let you roll.<br/><br/>2. But every time the GM says "Roll the dice," they're explicitly telling you that you DO have a chance now. A natural 20 will always mean you get something substantially in the direction you wanted to go, and it's up to you know to seize the opportunity and go the rest of the way. Two 20s in a row will pretty much get you there. When the GM says "Roll!", they need to be prepared to go off the rails.<br/><br/>EDIT: This is I guess another way of saying "The GM must know and respect the limits of their authority, not try to expand and sneak around them."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463475/#Comment_463475" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-20T17:21:42+00:00" title="May 20, 2017  5:21PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jeph" rel="nofollow">Jeph</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>So in that style, the player's choices really do always matter\u2014always for the path, usually for the destination.

Moment-to-moment, play can be surprising and full of twists.<br/><br/>However, over the long term, <i>the city always falls</i>. <br/><br/>Why? Because the GM has already judged the situation, as he or she was creating it, and decided that the attackers are better armed and better trained, and that the morale of the people in the city is weak. Furthermore, this exists in the context or a larger war where the defenders are on the losing side.<br/><br/>*Sometimes*, character actions and a few lucky rolls can create enough fictional momentum for the GM to say, "Hey, you know what? I expected them to lose this fight, but your clever plan totally turned that around!"<br/><br/>However, most of the time, the thing the GM expected happens, because - after all - s/he had already created and set up the entire fictional world for that to be the "logical" outcome.<br/><br/>Over the long term, in play, the city falls, more often than it is rescued. Over many many sessions, the overall arc of the story becomes more-or-less exactly what the GM "expected" and set up. Three campaigns in a row all look pretty similar, because they are so strongly guided by a heavy-handed and consistent artistic vision.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463476">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463476/#Comment_463476" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-20T17:49:45+00:00" title="May 20, 2017  5:49PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are there little things a GM could do to avoid the trap of their own vision, Paul?<br/><br/>Like maybe this sort of mindfulness:<br/><br/>1) When there's a Big Planned Outcome that you expect to happen, identify the main 2-4 most important factors that ensure that your expected outcome Shall Be So. "The city will fall because we have no trained army, we have no military quality weapons and armor, and the people are full of despair." Write them down, maybe.<br/><br/>2) For each of these factors, make sure you know how you'll communicate them to the players, or telegraph an opportunity to discover them.<br/><br/>3) In play, prevent yourself from throwing up additional unplanned barriers to swaying these factors; really try to be impartial here. They're probably big enough in their own right that you don't need to "protect" them anyway.<br/><br/>4) Every time the players manage to sway one of those factors, let the game really feel it, and put some due consideration into how it changes the Big Planned Outcome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463477/#Comment_463477" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-20T17:53:49+00:00" title="May 20, 2017  5:53PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I once played as a "guest character" in an ongoing campaign. The basic conceit was a group of heroes who were trying to unravel a conspiracy headed by an incredible powerful and dangerous Big Bad villain.<br/><br/>You couldn't say what would happen from session to session, because the world was essentially a "sandbox": the characters could go anywhere and do anything they wanted. <br/><br/>However, every location, every character, and every clue ultimately tied into the larger conspiracy/mystery. So, of course, everyone - GM and players - were steering the game towards a final confrontation with the Big Bad. (The GM also gave the Big Bad a power which made it impossible to defeat it before then.)<br/><br/>Now, the GM didn't plan a specific plot. He didn't decide ahead of time how the Big Bad might be defeated (except to prep its powers and abilities). <br/><br/>But, of course, the game steered reliably forward along the specific clue paths and ended up in the final showdown. In the showdown, it was just a question of the players coming up with a clever ploy to take down a far more powerful enemy, which they did. Of course, the GM played into their hands a little bit, too. We were all looking forward to that ending, right? Or hoping for it, anyway...<br/><br/>In the longer scope of things:<br/><br/>No single scene or event was predictable... there was no specific "railroad". But, in the end, there was a long desperate search through a conspiracy, ending in a showdown against the Big Bad at the last possible minute, and then the heroes, against all odds, overcame and saved the world.<br/><br/>Playing in this style... every campaign would eventually start to feel the same.<br/><br/>This is, perhaps, a good illustration of what I ran into.<br/><br/>The ways around it were - more prep (basically, more different setting elements to interact with), less hands-on scene framing, and more interjection of events and action into the story from the GM side. <br/><br/>These were successful to a large degree, but it was *a lot of work* for the GM, without commensurate reward.

It's not a<br/>challenge and the gm is actively working to reveal his preplanned plot<br/>so as long as the players come up with a semi-reasonable plan we end<br/>up finding out what is happening. Things like the cop who is pushing<br/>the boundaries of what's acceptable gets glossed over because what<br/>we're doing is solving the crime and catching the bad guys. We throw<br/>things in like the rebel cop for a little bit of spice but we dont<br/>want too much spice cause that'll spoil the soup. The meat of the game<br/>is doing the police work and catching the criminals."<br/></blockquote>\nIt was interesting that the game I referred to in my previous post, since it was framed as a TV show, had a lot of interesting character bits in it, about whether such-and-such hero would be willing to give up his moral sense to do what they needed to do, or whether the anger of that hero could be held in check by the others. But the sense of the over-arching<br/>struggle with the Big Bad (and the deep dark mystery underlying the campaign) meant that moving along and getting the info would take precedence--those character struggles were just details used to colour scenes, not drivers for story development.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463479/#Comment_463479" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-20T18:00:24+00:00" title="May 20, 2017  6:00PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" rel="nofollow">WarriorMonk</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I believe it's been mentioned before but I'm not sure and can't find it in the thread, but has anybody gave a thought at the dice slot machine as a "random table improvised on your mental palace"?

As whimsical and railroading as a spicy dice roll GM can be, there are times when she wants to be a bit more fair, leaving things to chance. So you pick up the dice and tell yourself "based on players decisions/NPC plans there are four things that can happen, let's roll to see where things may go". You can also do this in several rolls, walking through the forking path of possibilities in your head and letting the dice choose left or right on each bifurcation. </p></div></blockquote>\nThis is more or less how I played in the "spicy roll" style. I would try to commit to outcomes before rolling the dice. <br/><br/>It had benefits, but, over the long term (as I described above), created the same outcomes.<br/><br/>When I started playing with *overt* stake setting instead ("Ok, this is a crossroads in the story. What might be the outcome here? Ok, this could happen. What else could happen? Ok, now let's roll to see which it is..."), the game transformed completely.

The habit is that whenever I write stuff for my comics, I never use anything I have readed as a base, to avoid the text from feeling copied from somewhere else. The trouble is that whenever I come up with something good, I rarely can remember it for future use. This however derived to the same idea Paul and others had: ask the players.<br/><br/>Spicy dice roll with one GM is okay, but five heads can definitely come up with better stuff. All you need is ask in a way that doesn't disrupt the immersion nor gives way to analysis paralysis nor blank-page syndrome.<br/><br/>Keep in mind however that this GMing style is not up for everyone. If you value "fair real-experience simulation and competition" this will never be your thing, as it's too permissive about lying, manipulation, misdirection and well, illusionism. You don't have to there, but there are still many things in this style that give too much that "lying vibe" <br/><br/>Also, there is another sort of "competition" going underneath the conversational aspect of the game; opposite to "competing using written rules" in this game the competition is solely based on the unwritten rules of the social contract. The game is basically still the same: "can I get away with what I want or something better?", though instead of relying just on the game tactics, rules and math (which are being dismissed in this style) it relies on conversational player skill, which can be any kind of mix from negotiation, misdirection, charisma, assertiveness, bullshitting, etc. And on that level, the social competition in this sort of game can become utterly ruthless.<br/><br/>Perhaps the best we could do to make this style functional would be to write down those unwritten rules, reduce the amount of player skill required on that part?

In fact, in practice I've found that often the GM burns out if she doesn't enlist player help. Eventually the GM will end up without enough good fresh twists on his story at best and unable to do further illusionism and mantain credibility at worst. Change players, take rests between campaigns -eventually the results wil be the same. <br/><br/>More often than not, the GM will change to a different playstyle before things go too far. Fair full competitive sim is an option. Switching to story games is another valid one. I believe Cooperative Spicy Roll could be a good option too, it's the one I'm playing now and it's been good so far. I'm still making a few adjustments to my gamestyle to make it <br/>better, some are borrow from story games, some are borrow from Fair Sim but it still owes a lot to the default Spicy roll.<br/><br/>You can use a few well proven tricks to help players invest in the myth, like cooperative worldbuilding, using player flags as main setting elements, mountain-witching to help them come up with stuff from their character point of view, giving them xp for doing and completing objectives they have come up with by themselves, stealing ideas from them, building seriously upon every single thing you can even if they said it like a joke, following the players around, build upon and maximize their expectations, etc. <br/><br/>Then add charisma, some of your own prep, slot machine rolls mixed with some story sense, be ready to impro, oracle the dice and your random tables, and you're set. No need to kick players, railroad them into investing in the myth or prepare for everything. It's true that you won't always have a full fair competitive sim game this way, but you can turn the 50% chance of having a bad game experience due to poor tactics, inexperienced players, etc into a 10% if you're good at it. <br/><br/>If you're unconfortable or just suck at this you will definitely have a 90% chance of ruining the game though, even when using this techniques. You should probably go for Fair Sim or story games instead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463495/#Comment_463495" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-21T19:47:04+00:00" title="May 21, 2017  7:47PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 21, 2017 7:51PM by David_Berg.">edited May 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jeph" rel="nofollow">Jeph</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>How does Todd Fu[r]ler get all his players on board so thoroughly?</p></div></blockquote>Todd provides very clear structure and roles.

I've only once seen this kind of game with a GM who consciously bought into these kinds of ideas, and I was only there briefly.

Though it does use some charisma and a lot of flexibility. I mean, it's not easy to pile up player input without at best doing some minor adaptation. You may also have to throw away the original setting or take it as just a general direction. Everything that another player adds must be sculpet to fit whatever was stated previously. Though that may take you to blocking some input, at least there would be a logical reason to that. You can always tell the players then "to try another way" as in archipielago. I personally have turned "making similar suggestions" into my signature technique to meant "try another way".<br/><br/>Also, you have to be very attentive to catch the player's drift: there can be second intentions behind some players words or actions. Sometimes you have to spot those quiclky and offer them directly to the players, with anything that makes it an interesting twist. This fosters further good communication between the GM and the players. You are still throwing challenges at the players, but your words and body language can't always be confrontational. Most of the time you're on their side, you warn them about bad things, give them signals and chances to get a good idea of what are they fightning before the fight. You celebrate their good ideas, you pay attention and help them roleplay when you catch their drift. You never steal their thunder. You have characters react to them in positive or interesting ways. And try to never, never block. You can ask for all kind of requirements, give them what they asked with a twist, it's either "yes and", "yes, but" or "no, but". It's never "you can't" or "you miss". That's throwing a golden opportunity through the drain.<br/><br/>When they trust that you will make a good story out of whatever they throw at you, they will start to edit themselves, but they won't leave you without material. If you let them engage in whatever they want to do, they will invest in it and keep it going. You only have to build some conflict and color over it, remember all the small interactions and keep consequences flowing. The rest is adding your own stuff only where needed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463552/#Comment_463552" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-25T17:12:58+00:00" title="May 25, 2017  5:12PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was reading through <i>How to Game Master Like a Fucking Boss</i>, and it introduces this variation on his idea, which he calls VSd6:\n<blockquote><br/>Each session, players receive 7d6 (3d6 if you want a more<br/>dark and desperate campaign or running a two-hour demo)<br/>which they can spend on doing mighty deeds appropriate to<br/>their race, class, experience, skills, abilities, and backstory.

Feelings we're used to from real life, feelings we like to have more in our lives than the usual dosis we get from reality. Some people want a bit of power fantasy, some want more danger and feel alive, some want to feel with more intensity, some want the most exciting moments of their lifes to be less far apart. And we are using all sorts of different mechanics, procedures and points of view to simulate those.<br/><br/>In exchange for some of those things we can pay some prices and some not. Everyone is quite different in that respect. And that's good, otherwise all rpgs would be too much alike and we would get bored of them quite fast.<br/><br/>So, if playing with no myth makes no sense and feels uncomfortable, it's okay, it makes sense and that's who you are. I could tell you that: <br/><br/>-playing with no myth or just a bit of myth looks like playing with myth in the sense that things are framed in the scene when they matter, except that here the question of when were they first thought of doesn't matter: all we care here is the present and future consequences.<br/>-looking away from how, when or why were things created is the price we are okay to pay, as long as things stay fun for everyone.<br/>-It's like using the "If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?" state of mind to play the game. If something isn't relevant yet and may or may not see use in the game, why do we spend time thinking of it when we can wing it when the moment comes?<br/>-Requires lots of confidence in the impro skills of the GM and the players as well as lots of a specific kind of trust between them all. It's half trust that instead of questioning the source, everyone will roll with whatever we bring to the table, and half trust that nobody will bring something that ruins immersion for others at the table.<br/>-You can define general concepts in the myth and leave all sort of details for later. We all do it at some level, as nobody prepares for absolutely everything.<br/><br/>But while all this makes sense for me, it isn't truth for everybody. You may play in a group that is comfortable with this for years and get the idea, it doesn't mean you will get used to pay the same price and not see your immersion broken. As everyone is looking for different things, even when using the same tools the gaming experience will vary.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463686/#Comment_463686" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-04T01:28:11+00:00" title="June  4, 2017  1:28AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My experience with GMs who use the Spicy-Rolling interpretation of how the mechanics are supposed to work, but are genuinely not trying to railroad, has generally been pretty bad. In fact, it's arguably worse than a game with a pre-set outcome, because then you have just a big pile of mush. The primary problem is that, even though such GMs may not be driving towards any particular outcome, they're also not aware of the correct procedures for having a particular fictional input lead to an output. So,<br/><br/>(a) Any given choice a player makes may well be accidentally invalidated even if it really shouldn't be.<br/><br/>(b) The game is often kind of aimless if the GM is ignoring whatever there is in the system that is supposed to give the game coherence and momentum.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463718/#Comment_463718" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-05T16:55:27+00:00" title="June  5, 2017  4:55PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've seen some good games in this style, Deliverator (I was part of a group that played several long campaigns this way back in the early 2000's, and ran one myself), but on the whole I'd agree with you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463727/#Comment_463727" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-06T03:43:13+00:00" title="June  6, 2017  3:43AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, I can imagine it working better in a campaign format, where you have some time to make things coherent, and an occasional "off" or slower session doesn't ruin things.

Here that part is crucial, as the GM may not decide for one or another until she starts describing the consequences.<br/><br/>That's not to say that there isn't any internal logic to their decision or that is purely random. There must be logic behind it, even if the GM rolls the dice for herself as an oracle to help decide. If there isn't any logic and she just humors the players, it will be as obvious as Deliverator described.<br/><br/>The logic behind the GM decisions must come from what makes the more sense and it's more interesting when you look at the big picture and start connecting the dots. Maybe average that with whatever sounds more exciting as a twist, but never try to just support the whole thing on this, as even if you go for big emotions, failed logic will bring the whole thing down and ruin the moment.<br/><br/>Spicy dice-roll can work, but there are lots of hidden tricks to it; misdirection, some collaborationism, particular ways to address GM and player communication; it may feel like freeform at some points but there's actually a complex safety net of unwritten rules at work, and not all of them are openly explained to the players. GMs using this usually interiorize this type of gameplay so much that when they explain what they consider to be the rules and procedures, they will never actually think of the actual and most important rules and procedures to make this work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463809/#Comment_463809" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-10T07:38:53+00:00" title="June 10, 2017  7:38AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I got off on a bit of a wrong foot with this thread.

I've missed your commentary. That story sounds awful, I don't want play like that! Ideally I would like to cleanly expunge that kind of invalid, duplicitous use of GM force, without weakening the GM's ability to be forceful at other times. Perhaps a principle ought to be, "Don't deceive the players."<br/><br/>Maybe I'm in the same boat as you, but more cargo-cultish: I'm taken in by the energy and intensity of the sessions Silmenume describes, and I think I can evoke the same thing by copying the dice mechanic. How foolish!<br/><br/>Or maybe not! I've been reading a bit about the original Braunsteins, and the re-creations of them that went on at Gen Con circa 2008. These were the original proto-RPGs run by Major Wesley in the late '60s, descended from the Strategos wargames, which were themselves first codified in the late 1800s by US military types as a training tool.<br/><br/>The core mechanic in Strategos and in Braunstein was: you had an impartial referee, and whenever you have some ambiguity, you ask the referee what would happen. The ref thinks really hard, taking into account all the circumstances, and give you their best informed opinion: that's what happens.<br/><br/>The Spicy Dice roll is just exactly that! Except sometimes, the die tells the ref to not give the most likely thing, but the next-most-likely thing in the better or worse direction. And sometimes sometimes, the dice tell you to do something that's not likely at all.<br/><br/>Soon-ish I will be able to put by $$$ where my mouth is (and possibly my foot as well), and actually start a game in this fashion, after my group stops going on honeymoons and other nonsense.

The similarities are kinda obvious\u2014a more rigorous codification of what a lot of good traditional play has going on under the hood, begin and end with the fiction. The differences, hm.<br/><br/>The differences, hmm. In *World games, a move is triggered by some fictional positioning. In Spicy Rolling, you just roll the dice constantly, sometimes without much of a reason at all, just fishing for those timing queues and positive / negative valence guidance... and, also, on top of that, there are probably *World style moves, but kinda implicit in the technique rather than explicit in the rules, and squishier.<br/><br/>In *World, the assumption is No Myth, with the setting being gradually codified during play. My assumption is Lots And Lots And Lots Of Myth to start with, and then building it up even more during play.<br/><br/>In *World, the assumption is the story will emerge from the interaction between the various bits and bobs that the players' characters bring to the table. My assumption is that the story will emerge as the players and the GM weave the characters into the myth of the setting, then make the players responsible for it, then put it under threat.<br/><br/>I don't even know if I'm getting at the core of what makes *World feel like the answer to a totally different question from the one I'm asking, or if I'm just scratching around the edges of the issue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463823/#Comment_463823" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-11T05:01:26+00:00" title="June 11, 2017  5:01AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the Myth<br/><br/>Btw, AW has as a core principle "Do what your prep requires".

(I want to start a "1001 Nights Off" series of side stories where we do things like Microscope Chronicle on that dinar with a chipped edge etc.)<br/><br/>I mean, you nailed my thoughts on the dice mechanic with the phrase "cargo cult".<br/>Since you started this thread, I've been very inspired by the game in question. But the title was <i>coherent</i>. And I guess our attempts at codifying it and cohering it diverged.<br/><br/>I described our system in "What did you play last week" \u2014 Corsair Council.<br/><br/>So a change from Cary's game is that while the d20:s are flying, every die rolled is made for an understandable reason with codified consequences.  And that's what you're going for too, but we just codified it very differently. You've created a general mechanic. (Hence I associated to Cthulhu Dark.) And I've instead applied D&amp;D. When they trigger things that are governed by D&amp;D, then they roll as per it. Con saves, attack rolls\u2026<br/><br/>I was inspired by something Jerry Holkins said. (Please don't take this as an endorsement of him, politically.) I can't find the exact quote\u2026 but that D&amp;D can be a substrate (maybe that wasn't the word he was using) to build on. That's why being super familiar with <i>one</i> trad system is valuable. We're doing Dramasystem but when someone pulls a sword, everyone knows exactly what's at stake.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463981/#Comment_463981" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-14T21:35:36+00:00" title="June 14, 2017  9:35PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is more than a bit on the goofy side... but seems entirely in-context for this thread:<br/><br/><a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/eixGf" rel="nofollow">Imgur Comic featuring Gary Gygax</a><br/><br/>Silly as it is, it reminds me of some (hell, many!) of my early roleplaying experiences.<br/><br/>It seems like, at some level, it's a very natural way to play D&amp;D for a lot of people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463992/#Comment_463992" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-15T00:19:38+00:00" title="June 15, 2017 12:19AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why, the d20 in that comic is the very same marbled green &amp; gold as my very own favorite die!<br/><br/>I think it's so much a natural way to play D&amp;D that tons of people do it by accident, and don't even notice that they're not following the rules of the game as written in letter nor in spirit.<br/><br/>I also think it's a very small step from the <i>original</i> roleplaying mechanic, as it appeared in Major Weseley's Strategos-N refereed napoleonic wargame and later his Braunsteins.

I don't see any reason why the game wouldn't work very well on a more "Heavy Myth" kind of way (so long as the flavour of the rules and playbooks and such suited it, of course).<br/><br/>Two things, I think, could potentially get in the way:<br/><br/>* Places where the rules give significant authority to the players over what happens and what it looks like could mess with a GM's plans, if it's intended as a railroad. <br/><br/>There are lots of spots, little and big, where the rules hand authority to the players or the dice in a way which the "spicy roll" never does. (As a simple example, consider how the "read a person" move would allow players to suss out any kind of "this NPC will deceive them and they will go along with it, until, later..." ploy on the part of the GM.)<br/><br/>* Character advancement and transformation may mess with any attempt for static and slow-moving long-term play. (Easily fixed by slowing down XP gain or XP needed per advance, of course.)<br/><br/>Were you thinking of something else?<br/><br/>Apocalypse World comes with a culture of "let's start by making up stuff together", but it's not in any way (that I can see) fundamental to the ruleset. It seems to me that it would work very well in a "Full Myth" style of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463994/#Comment_463994" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-15T01:06:01+00:00" title="June 15, 2017  1:06AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lessee, ways I think *World is inappropriate for this style of game:<br/><br/><b>The Die Is Your Pacing Mechanic.</b> Canonically, you're pretty much rolling <i>all the time</i> as the GM fishes for those 1s and 20s. There's often not a known reason that the players are rolling. The result of the roll is often "Nothing much happens, aside from the obvious thing that was clearly about to happen." Except for on those crit fails and successes. Those are timing queues to the GM. They both put the players in a mood receptive to something big and different happening, and tell the GM when it should happen.<br/><br/>*World basically can't do this. The whole point of having moves is that you only use the game mechanics at certain points, grounded in fictional positioning. You can't use the mechanics at other points; you can't not use the mechanics at those points. Dice as timing, and dice triggered by specific fictional situations, are basically antithetical, as I see it.<br/><br/><b>The Die Modulates GM Authority.</b> Along the same lines, the 1s and 20s prime the players to accept bigger, bolder insertions from the GM into the shared imagined space, things that follow less clearly from what's already been established. From the *World point of view, you still see this effect at the table when you roll boxcars or snake eyes... but actually taking advantage of it is a <i>bad habit</i> that the GM probably needs to kick.<br/><br/>It's not part of the rules as written or intended. On a miss, make a hard move; on a 7-10 or 10+, the move tells you what to do; if the GM <i>also</i> decides that now's the moment for the cavalry to arrive because you rolled two sixes, that's kinda cheating, because it's not making a move that follows from the fiction.<br/><br/>(Sidenote: I have sent myself off on a tangent with my last post, and am now reading through <a href="https://sites.duke.edu/andrewbyers/files/2016/09/Strategos-Volume-1.pdf" rel="nofollow">the original Strategos wargame from the 1880s</a>.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21103/the-spicy-dice-roll-salvaging-something-coherent" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21103/the-spicy-dice-roll-salvaging-something-coherent" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21103/the-spicy-dice-roll-salvaging-something-coherent/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21103/the-spicy-dice-roll-salvaging-something-coherent/p3" rel="next">3</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21103/the-spicy-dice-roll-salvaging-something-coherent/p3" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F21103%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F21103%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>The Spicy Dice Roll: salvaging something coherent - Page 3 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21103/the-spicy-dice-roll-salvaging-something-coherent/p3" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="The Spicy Dice Roll: salvaging something coherent - Page 3" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21103/the-spicy-dice-roll-salvaging-something-coherent/p3" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Oh, yes - I assumed that this particular use of the dice wasn't a core element of play.

(no joke, I got this from a group of kids I GMed to at a game club here)<br/>-Then you notice that when you want to do something you've got to roll the dice, maybe not if its too simple, but when it's about something important you want to happen, you've gotta roll 'em. High bonuses are a good thing to have here.<br/>-Then, you roll a 20 and something awesome happens! it doesn't matter if you didn't have the bonuses or the skills for it.<br/>-And when you roll a 1, something awful happens, and it sucks big time, and you can't blame anyone but the dice.<br/><br/>And you may think that's all what the game is about. You can play just by knowing this and develop all kind of traumas, phobias, philias and manias that become your personal methodology to traverse the game. Later you can apply this to GMing and traumatize your players in the same way or different ones. Which could have been avoided if the players/GM had took the time to actually read more about the game and notice the real intentions of the designer -considering the designer gave a lot more of thought to the game and came up with a good enough clear way to explain it to others and help them avoid the possible pitfalls that could ruin the experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464080">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464080/#Comment_464080" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-16T16:53:10+00:00" title="June 16, 2017  4:53PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with that.<br/><br/>I think there's also an element of peer pressure or social pressure involved, as well:<br/><br/>"Hey, look!

Thus, it's ignoring all the reasoning needed to make it a <i>healthy</i> experience. <i>Emotionally</i> it's a strong one and that's what is probably moving us to build an structure that could somewhat help make it into a healthy experience.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that's impossible though. We just need to be aware that we're talking about fostering intense conflicting emotions between the players and the GM, using a dangerous amount of GM fiat to handle the whole situation and in the worst case, keeping the players distracted so they don't notice anything is going wrong. This analysis makes it sound bad for a reason: this is of course the worst turn things could take while still letting the players have fun. I doubt that could be a healthy point to arrive at.<br/><br/>Could the healthy option include anything resembling playing principles the GM must adhere to, maybe hero points to give the players something to defend their agency, besides the whole system being honest enough about what it is and what it isn't?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464108/#Comment_464108" name="Item_108" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-16T21:53:36+00:00" title="June 16, 2017  9:53PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 16, 2017 9:54PM by Jeph.">edited June 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, I guess we're all more on the same page than I'd thought <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I very much agree that GM principles and explicit social contract have gotta be part of my experiment for this play style.

Just as often, it's not even intentional - just the way people learned to play from the beginning.

I haven't run into that, but if I did, I think I'd be wondering whether this was the sort of game where none of my choices matter, or where all of my choices about stuff other than how to succeed in tasks matter.  I've definitely played in some games where my rolls were all GM-fudged but I got to steer the plot by deciding what the party cared about and pursued.  Oh, wait, those were all home campaign games, though, not con one-shots.  Yeah, the nightmare version seems way more likely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467077/#Comment_467077" name="Item_119" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-17T20:02:21+00:00" title="October 17, 2017  8:02PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I made one decision in the first 45 minutes of play, and it was not terribly meaningful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467084/#Comment_467084" name="Item_120" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-18T00:09:47+00:00" title="October 18, 2017 12:09AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OW.  <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21103/the-spicy-dice-roll-salvaging-something-coherent/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21103/the-spicy-dice-roll-salvaging-something-coherent">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21103/the-spicy-dice-roll-salvaging-something-coherent/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21103/the-spicy-dice-roll-salvaging-something-coherent/p3">3</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F21103%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F21103%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
