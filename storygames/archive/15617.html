Well, D&amp;D; has some deep roots. What could that mean? I was thinking it'd be a fun game to build Frankenstein's Monster style D&amp;D; out of parts of older editions. We can assume that some surgery will be needed to connect them the right way; don't worry about connective tissues too much. Anything printed that uses the six sacred stats is fair game. (I don't know a lot of the third-party stuff but that doesn't mean you shouldn't use it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's mine:<br/>\n<ul class="bbcode_list">\n<li>Character classes like the old school. Let's take a step back from builds, multiclassing, and the intricate player choices of 3e and 4e, back to characters that you could meaningfully describe in two words like "Elf wizard." No more made-up words as character classes!</li>\n<li>Races like waaaay back in the day. I'm happy with "human, dwarf, elf." All the other stuff can be setting-specific, hobbits included.</li>\n<li>Race mechanics like 4e. Give everyone something unique and cool, and give them access to race-specific stuff farther down the line, but for sure, give them strong race identity at first level. "You can't push me" is way cooler than "I sense that this passage has a fifteen-degree slope."</li>\n<li>Combat as fast as AD&amp;D;'s. I want to take my turn fast and sweet.</li>\n<li>Combat moves as cool as 4e's. The whole logic of forced movement is so breathtaking.</li>\n<li>Monster descriptions like 1st edition Advanced. I liked the ecologies and stuff. I want to see things that tell me how different sorts of monsters coexist; I want their stat blocks to tell me what biomes they live in, what they do i their everyday lives, and how they affect the things around them. Also I want hilarious illos like the Invisible Stalker. (But I don't really want a ton of stupid dungeon fauna like the...monster that is a tentacled stalagmite or whatever.)</li>\n<li>Monster abilities like 4e. Three or four attacks that give them some personality. I don't get anything useful out of "All wizard spells."</li>\n<li>Settings like AD&amp;D.; Not <i>the same settings,</i> necessarily, but I thought it was great that there was a whole aranea nation in Red Steel, and there were all these crazy races you could only play in Planescape. Cut down on cross-setting pollination; make each one really different.</li>\n<li>A proliferated skill list like AD&amp;D;, just check marks for if you've got the skill or not. Skills don't have to matter for combat; they are there for non-combat characterization.</li>\n<li>I hear that once upon a time there was like a big-deal play culture about amassing a following, a stronghold, and properties? Transitioning from adventurer to landowner and employer? Let's bring that back too. Sounds cool. Is the Birthright setting good material to mine for this? I dunno.</li>\n<li>Finally, I just want to take equipment out. I don't want it. And artifacts like 2e. Big, crazy, setting-tied plot stuff and apparati of Kwalish.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354088">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354088/#Comment_354088" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-12T13:14:51+00:00" title="January 12, 2012  1:14PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            AD&amp;D 1e's Monster Manual had just a couple of short paragraphs for each creature.

Here's some feedback about what doesn't work from the Early Days:<br/>\n<br/>\n* Tactical combat is poorly supported.  By this I don't just mean flanking, reach, etc., but also, "This area here is full of lava, fumes give you -2 to damage" and "this spot over here is magnetic, if you've got metal armor you fly to the ceiling" or something like that.  I get the impression 3e and 4e are better at this, but there's probably a point where it gets so complex there's diminishing returns.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Save-or-Die.  Most commonly this shows up as poison, but also for petrification, charms, and so on.  You want the game to be dangerous, and you want luck to play a part in your character's survival, but when you've invested 300 hours in developing your 5th level Fighter, it sucks to see him get bitten by a phase spider (save vs. poison at -2!) and die.  I saw this happen and felt so bad for the player.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Consequences for failure other than HP loss or death.  First, because HP loss is fairly easily fixed and even death is correctable.  But also because it means that if anything interesting is gonna be at stake, it's going to be due to GM Fiat, which in the hands of a good GM is fun, and in the hands of a bad GM looks a lot like bullying.  I'm not sure there should be rules for this, but some good "soft rules" would help a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Mass Combat.  Clashing armies are a staple of fantasy fiction, but has never been implemented very well in D&amp;D.;  <i>Chainmail</i> requires too much stuff.  The War Machine rules in Mentzer's <i>Companion Set</i> look rather untested to me.  <i>Battlesystem</i> was insanely complicated.  I think 3e and 4e basically stopped trying to do this at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Naval Combat.  Similarly, either for big fleets or just boats going at it.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Strongholds &amp; Dominion Building.  The only version of the game that really treats this is the Mentzer <i>Companion Set</i>, reprinted in the <i>Rules Cyclopedia</i>.  Our group hasn't experimented much with this, though I've been itching to do so.  As I understand it, Tavis &amp; the Gang have been working really hard on <i>Adventurer, Conqueror, King</i> to solve this particular problem among others.  I'll be curious to see how it shakes out.  But my point is that while this stage of play was promised in the Early Days, that promise was never satisfyingly fulfilled.  In particular, it would be great to have some procedures on how to run a political intrigue game, the same way there are procedures on how to explore dungeons or the wilderness.  (The procedures in the Moldvay or Mentzer Basic Set are crystal clear and just really well done.)<br/>\n<br/>\n* City Adventures.  Similarly: some adventures are like investigations or heists in the big city, rather than schlepping through the dungeon. Some guidance on building and running these would be helpful.  <i>Vornheim</i> is an improvement here though maybe doesn't go far enough.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Magic Item Creation.  I never played 3e, but the SRD makes it look like there's a really robust system for magic item creation.  This was always one of the more hand-wavey tacked-on sub-systems of earlier editions, but it's one of those critical things that spell-guys handle, so it's nice to see some ideas for how to handle it.  Good on 3e!<br/>\n<br/>\n* In Early Editions, Race + Class tends to mean that all Elf Wizards are the same.  As taken in to the extremes of 3e and 4e, Feats maybe are going too far.  But it's nice to have some minor ways to differentiate your character.<br/>\n<br/>\n* The 2e Bard is awesome, destroying the 1e Bard monstrosity and the 3e Bard foppery.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Demi-Human Level Limits are really messed up and weird.  The idea seems to be that the Demi-Humans were markedly better than Humans at level 1.  So the consequence is that after years of play, the Demi-Humans suddenly hit a glass ceiling and can't advance any further--game balance via <i>very</i> delayed action.  (This isn't a crazy principle: the Magic-User's wuss-to-god power curve is sort of the inverse of this.)  And <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://muleabides.wordpress.com/2011/06/30/the-binocular-thief/" rel="nofollow">arguably the Thief class was written to avoid the demi-human level cap</a>.  But still: I think this problem needs to be solved in a different fashion than the cap.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, those are the big spots where I wish the Early Edition stuff had some better tools.  Otherwise, I think it's a really fun game, albeit one that's quirky and deliberately game-like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354114/#Comment_354114" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-12T17:14:40+00:00" title="January 12, 2012  5:14PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 12, 2012 5:19PM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are extra list tags scattered about the layout in the page source, this in combination with the Vanilla page template causes the interesting problems in display here. I believe that this is caused by the BBCode -&gt; HTML translation engine of Vanilla being confused by Shreyas's code in some manner. The easiest way to fix this is for Shreyas or a moderator to edit his post to eg. switch from BBCode to html tags, which surely won't cause a similar interpretation error. Either use html mark-up to write that list, or just make it ordinary text for now.<br><br>In case anybody's interested, the duplication of avatar images (the most striking and weird feature here to my eye, browsing in Firefox) we're seeing is clearly caused by the containing box being stretched to fill the list item it's been assigned. Apparently Vanilla displays avatar images as background images to otherwise invisible elements with horizontal repeat, so stretching the box causes the image to repeat as well. The vertical displacement is probably because list items have somewhat different alignment properties in the CSS in comparison to whatever those image boxes are supposed to be styled as. Only part of each image is shown because the background displacement is in conflict with the attributes of the list item.

Were I doing that new edition, it'd introduce core principles even simpler and more streamlined than the 0-edition core, focused on methodology and consisting mostly of historical essays that discuss the different ways things have been accomplished in the game's history of texts and play. It would accomplish integrating the best parts of all editions by refusing to systematize anything and requiring the GM to take personal responsibility of choosing the framework for his own campaign. I probably wouldn't even call it "Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th edition" (with Player's Guides, GM's Guides, etc.), but rather something like "A Basic Guide to Dungeons &amp; Dragons". Supplements would be things like "How to play monsters in your D&amp;D campaign", and anybody could write them (not that they can't currently, of course).<br><br>I admit that my viewpoint would end up discarding almost everything from the 3rd and 4th editions as "core" content, as both of those games are 85% miniatures skirmish combat rules, but on the other hand I would see publishing either or both of those systems as tactical skirmish supplements as entirely viable. (Well, 4th should really be a miniatures war game or something like that - not much point making it an optional fighting rules-set for a roleplaying game.) The type of content those two editions advocate with their massive skirmish combat focus is not very compatible with the best and most unique parts of the early game, so they would be best relegated into supplementary material for the folks who are into that sort of thing. Not discarded, though - that sort of thinking is just unnecessary when you're not trying to standardize the life out of everything.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James_Nostack</cite>You want the game to be dangerous, and you want luck to play a part in your character's survival, but when you've invested 300 hours in developing your 5th level Fighter, it sucks to see him get bitten by a phase spider (save vs. poison at -2!) and die.</blockquote>\nYes, this is the big contradiction of the game. As I see it, you can't have more than two of these three in the D&amp;D campaign paradigm: protection from death, xp progression and not retiring characters ever. The oldest D&amp;D has both character retirement and easy dying balancing the game's character development arcs, but as we know, the later culture succumbed to resurrection magics and infinite level grinds, which has blinded the designers to the simple fact that you can't have players keep hold onto the same characters forever without turning the game into a mindless hamster wheel. My own solution to the dilemma is to keep sudden death <i>and</i> character retirement, and have the players understand that if they take their successful and well-loved 5th level heroes to dungeons, they're risking their deaths - the only way to win is to retire the character, and the only way to lose is to have your character killed. You could remove character death from the game without ruining it by making retirement mandatory, though - Shadow of Yesterday is sort of like this, as we know. Or you could remove experience-accumulation (or stop it at some point), then it wouldn't matter that players continue playing the same characters on and on and on.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354130/#Comment_354130" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-13T00:23:14+00:00" title="January 13, 2012 12:23AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Funny, the thread looks fine on my phone, but here it's still jumbled.

I was just flipping through the Moldvay books yesterday and Basic lets you level up to 3 and Expert lets you level up to 14 (even if it's implied in the text that you could level indefinitely). The book doesn't offer any specific rules for domain management but it specifically calls out level 9 ("name level") as the point where you should be building your castle and stuff.<br>If memory serves The Mentzner set had up to 36 levels, but they were broken down into more discrete chunks (Companion, Master, Immortals in addition to B and E). I don't remember how this was handled in AD&amp;D but I'm sure there were domain rules after a certain level.<br><br>By comparison, 3rd edition had 20 levels, but they were all straight up, no discrete chunks, no domain management. It's not broken down in any way. And the added the Epic levels after that, which were somewhat different but not sufficiently. 4E did bring back the "tiers" of play, but they weren't very differentiated. It also had 30 levels straight up (3E's 20 + 10 epic).<br><br>Anyway, my poorly articulated point is: I think the game would greatly benefit from some more explicit breaking up of levels into chunks. D&amp;D at level 1 is a different game than D&amp;D at level 7 is a different game than D&amp;D at level 14, no matter the edition. So they should call that out explicitly. Maybe at level 11 you stop gaining HP and you get a castle. Maybe something else, whatever. But it's important that the whole 1 to 36 progression is not all just straight up with the same subsystems, because it always breaks. We need different arenas of play, retirement, castle management, stuff like that, to break up the grind.<br><br>Second of all.<br>James Wrote:<i> "Magic Item Creation. I never played 3e, but the SRD makes it look like there's a really robust system for magic item creation. This was always one of the more hand-wavey tacked-on sub-systems of earlier editions, but it's one of those critical things that spell-guys handle, so it's nice to see some ideas for how to handle it. Good on 3e!"</i><br><br>Fuckno. There's a reason Pathfinder tried to change the system around a bit, despite trying to be as compatible as possible, why Trailblazer (the most in-depth analysis of 3E's core mechanics I know of) dumped magic items altogether and why 4E left out crafting and stuff. 3E's magic item creation looks good on surface but there's broken glass shards in the cornflakes.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick" title="Troy_Costisick"><img alt="Troy_Costisick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thumbs.webs.com/s/viewProfilePic/?siteId=67823825&amp;memberId=67823877&amp;size=small&amp;530737"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick">Troy_Costisick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354148/#Comment_354148" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-13T07:23:41+00:00" title="January 13, 2012  7:23AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy, I think there's some coding problems with this thread.<br><br>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite> combat; they are there for non-combat characterization.<br>[*]I hear that once upon a time there was like a big-deal play culture about amassing a following, a stronghold, and properties?

It was pretty sweet and a completely different type of roleplaying from the hack and slash that characterized the first 12 levels.  Birthright actually really sucks, so I wouldn't want to use the mechanics from that setting, the AD&amp;D2e manual had a lot to go on, but not guidance from the GM really.  So I'd start there and then add on in a "system matters" sort of way.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
