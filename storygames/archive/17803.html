Something like Syndicate/Risk/Frozen Synapse combined where hidden card plays are made and there is a simultaneous reveal.

So, maybe with the group framing device being the writing/narration of similar anecdote.<br/>The book is opened to a random verse, and this verse is incorporated as a plot device within the week's story.<br/><br/>Lets say... Book/Chapter 1 verse 9<br/><br/>The COMMANDER stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerity, benevolence, courage and strictness.<br/><br/>Well, the reasoning behind this is due to Sunzi believing that Commanders require the love and loyalty of their men is a recurring theme within the book. A little lesson on that doesn't sound too hard. Could even make a pretty good Fiasco. Disloyal Soldiers sounds like the best heading for a tilt.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402799/#Comment_402799" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-06T09:55:21+00:00" title="January  6, 2013  9:55AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Write a game about governance (including warfare) in the Warring States period.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_402809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Pitre" title="Jason_Pitre"><img alt="Jason_Pitre" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/963/nF2ZB6ZWC4SFX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Pitre">Jason_Pitre</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402809/#Comment_402809" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-06T11:15:15+00:00" title="January  6, 2013 11:15AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Considering the prominence in that book in MBA studies, I suspect that it might work for a Shadowrun-style sci-fi megacorporate setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402815/#Comment_402815" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-06T11:53:48+00:00" title="January  6, 2013 11:53AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Blood and Honor basically replicates the entirety of the espionage section of the Art of War in mechanics.

You can calculate cost of deploying troops by extrapolating his numbers too.<br/><br/>To get some roleplaying juice out of this you could have the players portray different commanders dealing with these challenges but they would also have a number of personal hangups like being obsessed with glory, being cowards, being too friendly with the troops etc. and if they break these hangups they lose them. So in order to succeed they'll probably end up with a blank character sheet devoid of anything but robot adherance to good warcraft. Their epilogue if successful will probably not be too bright since the victories of a truly brilliant commander look like cakewalks or not even real wars. The Art of War is about the survival of the state and that might not be what people actually care about. The wiggle room that you have is that enemy commanders also have hangups that stop them from being perfect commanders and if you know the enemy you know what weakness you can exploit in them! The plot is probably about a civil war or something and the setup is commander school or a previous war so you can get to know the enemies. Also PvP! Lots of walking outside the room when plotting stuff to keep the fog of war.<br/><br/>Whenever I read The Art of War I want to use it as a rulebook, same with the swedish infantry manual (which contains lots of oddly specific stuff like it takes 3 hits with an anti-armor weapon to take out an armored vehicle and a fantastic picture about the attacks which the nation may suffer including a satellite shooting a laser).<br/><br/>The way I would actually do it though is play a regular game that has the potential for conflicts and simply use the Sun-Tzu stuff as GM-principles. Like if there is a battle coming up in Apocalypse World keeping the terrain types Sun-Tzu lists will make it interesting by default instead of just "here are some obstacles, here is a vantage point".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
