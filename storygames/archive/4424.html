As a GM, part of my role is to create uncertainty as to whether or not I am emotionally invested in the desire to, for instance, kill another PC. This encourages the player to make a similar investment. The game mechanic takes on the subtext of being an expression of will. The results are about how that will matches up to the narrative environment.</blockquote>\nAnd:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Malcolm Sheppard</cite>So I stand by what I say. The instrumental approach *is* passive. You et thrown a bone or beg along approved channels within the system to construct a narrative simulacrum -- it strings words together to sound like a story but there is no real obligation to give it sentimental weight. Real emotions are dangerous, but if you seek that type of play you go in conscious of the risks. There are of course degrees of commitment as well.</blockquote>\nAnd also:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Malcolm Sheppard</cite>An instrumental approach means that we primarily define the event in terms of a game systems resolution. A narrative simulacrum has the signs associated with narrative but not the substance. There is no shared sentimental investment in the outcome that approaches the in-world investment of the protagonists. The dice roll says my character is unhappy but I do not taste any unhappiness. I may be disappointed at the negative game effects but I am neither immersed not sympathetic to the character.</blockquote>\nAnd finally:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Malcolm Sheppard</cite>"Narrate this and you get a cookie" is passive and possibly lazy. It merely looks otherwise because people are moving their jaws to get said cookies. The assumption -- the destructive, vision-limiting assumption -- is that cookie handling is the sole axis of reward, whether it's a cookie for picking good feats for a cookie for pulling the narrative levers for a cookie.<br/></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99887/#Comment_99887" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-28T22:33:06+00:00" title="September 28, 2007 10:33PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, to make sure I've got all this straight (feel free to check me on all this): Malcolm, you favor an "immersive, emotionally invested" play style (although you later said immersion isn't required). You consider this mode of play to depend on suspense created by ambiguity regarding the intensions of other participants, and the willingness to risk "real emotions." You consider the "instrumental," or "defined primarily in terms of resolution," approach to games to be a detriment to this style because it creates shallow stories with real emotional investment. This seems to primarily be because of a focus on "Narrate this and you get a cookie" type mechanics. Am I doing OK so far?<br/><br/>About ambiguity of intentions and emotional risk: Are you saying that you want to intentionally leave group consensus regarding roleplaying (consensus on how to approach the activity, not consensus on "what happens") unsettled, so that you risk unpleasant emotions between the real, human people at the game table? Like when you say:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Malcolm Sheppard</cite>People seem to be so deathly afraid of being unhappy, even for a moment, that moments of genuine pleasure are stale and forced by comparison.</blockquote>\nyou're talking about real unhappiness with your fellow players?<br/><br/>I'm not saying that its ever possible to completely avoid frustration or bad feelings in a group, just that you can define a social contract to minimize it and provide a framework for dealing with it when it arises. Are you saying you prefer to leave that social contract undefined and at the mercy of covert power games or incompatible intentions?<br/><br/>I hope I'm making a decent amount of sense. I'm finding your posts confusing because while a post like this one:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Malcolm Sheppard</cite>Not long ago I was feeling uncomfortable with my D&amp;D game because I like to play it as pure tactical wargaming. I was so committed to that vision of play that I say all kinds of problems with our campaign: railroading, inconsistent rulings and so on. But I really love my friends. I stuck with it, communicated and realized that I needed to test the waters with a new playstyle. It worked for me and in many ways, I learns that the dissatisfaction from delayed ratification made the result taste very sweet indeed. That was me plodding and stumbling my way to option <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>.</blockquote>\nWould seem to contradict the impression that you oppose working out the social context for gaming with your fellow players, the very thing that you responded to with this line of argument was my and Shreyas' affirmation of <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=66" rel="nofollow">this insight of Vincent Baker's</a>: basically, <i>when we engage the resolution mechanics, we're not in conflict as </i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">players</span><i>, because we've already </i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">agreed</span><i> to arbitrate the situation by the mechanics.</i> This is pure social contract stuff. Just an acknowledgement that social contract exists, rules themselves are no substitute for an understanding of your group's contract, and making clear the distinction betweem fictional gameplay events and the real interaction between humans. If you seriously understand this and object to it, then I can only imagine that you favor an undefined contract where subtle manipulation, bitter misunderstanding, and hurt feelings are all possible and unchecked. Which confuses me a great deal.<br/><br/>Now, while I'm waiting for the verdict to come back on those interpretations, let me try to tackle the critique of "instrumental" games. You're saying they're shallow and passive because players just show up and expect to get rewarded "cookies" for saying stuff. This seems to be a problem for you on two counts: because the cookies are awarded for slavish reproductions (and therefore pale shadows) of stories, and because they create an expectation for instant gratifications. Let's approach these separately.<br/><br/>Regarding the first, I don't think there are many games that actually do this. I understand that the old "Pantheon and other Games" from Hogshead has a scoring system based on introducing appropriate elements, like in the haunted house scenario you get points based on narrating horror/mystery tropes. And I'm not very familiar, but I think Mutants &amp; Masterminds has something like this in terms of handing out brownie points in exchange for accepting Superheroic plot complications. There are some games that give points for "whatever" based on group enjoyment: PTA of course, and Shadow of Yesterday, and Sorceror. But that's about it, in terms of <i>my</i> admittednly limited game experience. Heroquest is a game that uses brownie points, but they're awarded in a more or less trad XP-like fashion. Capes is a game that's frikkin' <i>made</i> of brownie points, but you have to fight for ;em, tooth and nail. ANd they're arranged in an elegant economy of advantage tradeoff that's as far from "narrate for cookies" as East is from West.<br/><br/>In terms of instant gratification, that seems a gross simplification (though a popular one) of the spectrum of Story Games. Next to the "play in an evening" games like the Roach or My Life With Master, we've got Burning Wheel, and there are plenty of middle ground games like SToY and Sorceror, which support the short-term, but range into the mid-term. Sorceror is especially modular this way: you resolve a character's plot arc, take stock and decide if you want to keep going, and if so launch into a new plot arc. Sounds pretty elegant (I haven't yet played it). It keeps play going for as long as it's interesting, resolving when things feel right and neither quitting prematurely or dragging on interminably.<br/><br/>As I said in the previous thread, the granularity of either narration OR mechanics is a red herring. I think you're assuming that play following the "instrumental" approach is of necessity less emotionally invested. That it's completely protected from the threat of creative failure, and so is passive and flat. I'm here to tell you that's not necessarily the case. I've experienced a ton of passive (for me, maddeningly passive) play from my buddies in traditional systems, and my most exciting and emotionally invested roleplaying experiences have been in indie systems with different players. That's purely anecdotal, but it's the data I've got to offer. Intentionality with regard to social contract has nothing to do with dull, lifeless play. I personally find that it frees me to really plunge into a game with abandon, to go for the narrative jugular.<br/><br/>Your mileage may vary. I think you're off base in your correlation, though.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99895/#Comment_99895" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-28T23:38:02+00:00" title="September 28, 2007 11:38PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...is Malcolm talking about GMing as a thing unto itself that is always the same in every game, or are we talking about a specific game, here?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99897/#Comment_99897" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-29T00:03:17+00:00" title="September 29, 2007 12:03AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 29, 2007 12:09AM by noclue.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>...is Malcolm talking about GMing as a thing unto itself that is always the same in every game, or are we talking about a specific game, here?</blockquote>\nI think he's talking about roleplaying in general. Not necessarily GMing. I understand him to be saying that unless <i>players</i> actually feel emotional distress and unhappiness the narrative that is created is an insincere, hollow shell of a story. I assume sincere happy feelings are also to be felt, but since players are not resistant to those feelings, they are not the focus of the conversation.<br/><br/>Joel, I don't see anything in those posts that are anti-social contract. You can have a social contract that says "don't minimize discomfort among players" as easily as you can one that says "minimize discomfort." I also do not believe that Malcolm is pushing for inter-player frustration and confusion regarding the game and its mechanics. I believe he wants players to feel frustrated when their characters feel frustrated, or when the story is about frustration. And to feel sad when the story is about sadness. And confused when the story is about confusion. At least that's what I understood from the posts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99902/#Comment_99902" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-29T02:52:02+00:00" title="September 29, 2007  2:52AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Joshua's referring to this line I quoted from Malcolm:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Melinglor</cite>As a GM, part of my role is to create uncertainty as to whether or not I am emotionally invested in the desire to, for instance, kill another PC</blockquote>\nI don't think he's referring to an individual game. I think that wording arises from a hypothetical someone (James?) posted in the parent thread about whether a GM controlling an Orc was invested in whether or not a player's fighter hit that Orc. But what Malcolm means about the GM's role is a good question to ask.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite>Joel, I don't see anything in those posts that are anti-social contract.

Or the role of social contract. I'm hoping he'll come by and clear it up for me. The original post consists entirely of stabs in the dark, because no reading of his words is making sense to me, especially in light of the surrounding discussion. The main reason I'm tentatively reading him as advocating, "don't work out or understand your group's social contract" is because he's posted all this (in the parent thread) in direct rebuttal to my affirmation of Vincent's piece about player conflicts and mechanical resolution, which is all about Social contract. It says in effect that the former can't help you with the latter; it's only thropugh agreeing with each other (social contract) on the range of outcomes that we engage the mechanics at all. So if I say "social contract!" And someone else says, "no, THIS instead!" I don't know how else to read that except as opposing SC. Which is why I'm asking.<br/><br/>I don't want to run too far away with this before Malcolm's had a chance to respond. I'm just gonna wait to see what he makes of my mess o' confusion, then I'll have an idea of how to engage his ideas.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Georgios" title="Georgios"><img alt="Georgios" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Georgios">Georgios</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99904/#Comment_99904" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-29T03:15:33+00:00" title="September 29, 2007  3:15AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've read through Malcolm's posts in the other thread and to me they all read like "roll-playing vs role-playing" in Elaborate-ese and applied to Story Games. With the added claim that Story Games are in fact doing the former but trying to pass it off as the latter. <br/><br/>To be honest, I have seen players throw themselves into the mechanical elements and produce a story they were not emotionally invested in, because all they cared about was getting (mechanical) rewards. I have never seen anybody confuse the two though. After the game these people would just shrug, remain underwhelmed by the game and go back to their regular D&amp;D or Shadowrun games where they had an emotional investment to the story. The people who provided narration that was important to them though enjoyed the games and found the mechanics much more supportive of doing so. <br/><br/>Because story mechanics do not equate emotional investment. And I don't think there is anybody here who thinks that they do. (But maybe I'm wrong about this. I don't follow every thread and discussion on this board.) Emotional investment into the story / game is always dependent on the players and their willingness to commit to it. When a player is unwilling or unable (for whatever reasons) to do so, no story mechanics, social pressure or anything else can help. Nothing can make players care unless they want to. <br/><br/>It was true of those 'trad' games and it's true of Story Games as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99906/#Comment_99906" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-29T03:55:53+00:00" title="September 29, 2007  3:55AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 29, 2007 3:56AM by Malcolm Sheppard.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since I think this thread is really intended to divert my participation from the other thread for reasons I don't think are especially legitimate, I'm really not up for commenting on it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99910">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex" title="Alex"><img alt="Alex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex">Alex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99910/#Comment_99910" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-29T04:55:12+00:00" title="September 29, 2007  4:55AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have seen a fair number of APs that made it sound like games go like this: <br/>"Totally painful, heartrending shit just happened to my character -- that's awesome!"<br/><br/>This feels a bit weird given that the typical reaction you expect from experiencing the same story in a book or movie is: <br/>"Totally painful, heartrending shit just happened, and that makes me sad."<br/><br/>Is there a disconnect here, or just some kind of perceptual gap on my part?<br/><br/>-- Alex                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99913">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99913/#Comment_99913" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-29T05:20:05+00:00" title="September 29, 2007  5:20AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alex, sounds like a creator vs. audience effect.

At its face, his conclusion here is correct. In many online discussions, there is an unspoken assumption that cookie-picking is the core of play. And, yes, cookie-picking doesn't lead to good play.<br/><br/>But here's where he's wrong, or at least possesses a misperception---most games don't assume cookie-picking is the core of play. This all relates to the concept of the Fruitful Void, the idea that the real heart of play is entirely non-mechanical, and that the rules only serve to focus attention on that non-mechanical issue.<br/><br/>Look at DitV. The heart of the game relates to judgment (and the toll that kind of power has on individuals over time). The mechanics are set up to give the PCs overwhelming power. At that point, players have to decide when judgment is called for, and when mercy is required. This is entirely non-mechanical.<br/><br/>The assumption that cookie-picking is the center of play is often expressed by people who don't have much experience designing games. All of the successful indie publishers understands this point, at least intuitively. The issue with online discussion is that much of online discussion revolves around the discussion of individual mechanics. This often leads to misperception, as game designs are systems of  mechanics. To fully appreciate game design you need to discuss how different groups of mechanics interact with one another, not how individual mechanics work.<br/><br/>So his conclusion, by itself, is correct. But it's wrong to apply that conclusion to all indie games and designers. Malcolm, what's your response to that?<br/>_______<br/><br/>On the issue of emotional investment, that's hard. I believe there's a skill to recognizing what sort of content will connect with people, both yourself and others. I doubt that sort of thing can ever be systematized. Certain guidelines can make it easier, but it can never be guaranteed. It's a matter of individual skill.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99939">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99939/#Comment_99939" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-29T10:15:04+00:00" title="September 29, 2007 10:15AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: timfire</cite>The assumption that cookie-picking is the center of play is often expressed by people who don't have much experience designing games.

If that's the case then does it mean that the players have a totally different perception of what the games are about than the designers do? If so does this matter?

I actually put a lot of work into this thread, and to internet posting in general. It's not trivial to me to spend the time to not only read myriad threads, but craft thoughtful and (hopefully) engaging replies to the ones I think I can contribute to. My wife would certainly shed no tears if I spent less time and energy on it. In any case, I spent a good hour and a half or so (that may be slow for some people, but that's as fast as this poor brain and tro fingers can go) crafting what I thought would be a productive way to engage with what you're saying. That's a lot of work just to shut you up.<br/><br/>But there's really nothing I can do if you don't want to engage. If you want to dance around and fire off quips and ignore questions and criticisms, I can't stop you. The questions are honest ones, and they're here for you to answer any time you feel like treating me with an ounce of respect. Hell, you can even answer them in the parent thread if you're that invested in that approach. But until you're ready to do that, I guess I'm done.

It's a tricky thing to hold in your head when you're contemplating games ("OK, what cool thing to these mechanics purposefully <i>not do</i>?"), but makes oh, so much sense when examining a lot of the games in question. Dogs (the perennial example) has no "moral judgment" mechanics. A game doesn't <i>make</i> you do its thing, or lead you along Pavlovian-style, it gives you the <i>tools</i> to do that thing, then <i>gets out of the way</i> for you to do it.

By no-one cares, I mean both the "no one cares at all" and the "both outcomes are equally awesome, so I don't care which happen." One or the other were alarmingly common, maybe as much as 1 in 3. Include in cases where there's a conflict which only one or two people actually care about the outcome, and the others are just throwing in cards in order to have something to do and the frequency goes to almost 2 in 3 in my experience.<br/><br/>The problem wasn't so much a case of cookie-seeking though, and more of a case of rules guidelines saying there ought to be about one conflict per scene. Sure, the rules allow for no-conflict scenes, but they are discourged. Sometimes the producer calls a conflict because he's "supposed to" even though noone really cares. I suspect this is similar to the case of someone invoking a conflict or doing narration  merely because they are looking for a mechanical cookie.<br/><br/>(The other problem for me in PTA is "safe negotiation" over stakes. If theres an event you really don't want to see happen, you can veto it during the stakes selection. You are explicitly directed to find outcomes which are acceptable to all participants no matter which way the encounter goes.)<br/><br/>However, I don't see the phenomenon in my favorite hippie game, Polaris. In Polaris there are never conflicts that noone cares about (or they get resolved almost instantly by "and that was how it happened"), you can have scenes with no conflicts at all, and things aren't safe. I've gotten hit by statements while heart that induced a moment of panic "OMFG I can't let that happen, what am I going to do?"

My point was that in some games, PTA being the example I have the most actual play experience with, the rules encourage (with cookies) or request (with advice) conflicts or narrations, period. EVEN WHEN THERE IS A CHANCE NOONE CARES. So in PTA, the rules strongly urge the producer to find a conflict for a scene. There is no guerentee the producer himself will care about the conflict if he's just trying to meet his conflict-quota so the only hope is that the producer comes up with an idea that tickles the fancy of a player. Sometimes the producer thinks he's come up with an interesting conflict idea, even though its not really that interesting to any players. If it's TRULY uninspired, then every player might say "not interested" but usually there's at least one player with a lukewarm interest, especially if they are cognizant of the rule of having one conflict per scene, and thus play along. Even if the players are interested, there's no guerentee they'll care which side of the conflict wins, or even if they support the character in the conflict. Again, if the conflict was produced just to meet the conflict-quota, there's a very high risk it won't be a ideal conflict.<br/><br/>At the risk of delving into a game I have alot less actual play experience, I noticed a similar problem in DitV, which requires narration for every action. So the "cookie" here is if you want to do anything, you have to narrate something, and it has to be meaningful enough to satisfy the most picky player at the table. Sometimes I just did not care at that instant of time about narrating, but forced to by the rules I'd come up with something forced and flat and I'd be kinda grouchy about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100154">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100154/#Comment_100154" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-01T08:30:10+00:00" title="October  1, 2007  8:30AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: cydmab</cite>So the "cookie" here is if you want to do anything, you have to narrate something, and it has to be meaningful enough to satisfy the most picky player at the table.</blockquote>\nYup.

By definition that would be...unacceptable.</blockquote>\nWell the standard argument/example is chance of crappy character death. If there's a small chance of a character death which everyone agrees would be a crappy outcome, it adds a "charge" or "sense of urgency" to everything people do. Proper use of resources becomes important, etc. etc. I don't really find this argument personally very persuasive, but I can see how it might make a big difference for some, and I think the basic idea is tied to this thread in terms of some games becoming "too safe" and thereby losing an element of emotional energy.<br/><br/>In other words, it solves the problem of people not caring about the outcome of conflicts. If Universally Crappy Outcome is on the table as a possible result of every conflict, then every conflict "matters." You gain more emotional investment, at the price of risk that the Crappy Outcome happens. <br/><br/>However, my particular point in this case was not only is PTA safe, but its "obviously safe." A player can pretty easily veto anything that causes discomfort. About the only cost is it prolongs negotiation over stakes. I think Polaris solves this problem by not making safety obvious. If the mistaken or heart narrates something "unacceptable" it's going to take clever negotiation, sacrifice of previous narration, or the expenditure of limited resources to avoid the dreaded outcome. Usually there's a way out, but a) it can take a moment to figure out a solution and b) there's always a chance, no matter how small, that you're stuck. It also works better than the Universally Crappy Outcome option, because there's always at least one player who does want to see the thing happen.<br/><br/>To be more concrete, let me give an example from my last Polaris game. I was heart, and the mistaken narrated a But Only If... that my character had through incompetence accidentally killed her favorite squire. This was "unacceptable" to me - my vision as heart of the protagonist was that she was very competent, and the prospect of her killing off her squire at this early point in her story just was too much to bear. So for a couple seconds I was scrambling in my mind to find a way to prevent this horrific outcome. I decided to burn a You Ask Far Too Much, rendering me more vulnerable to a horrible event later on, but for now I'd staved off the terrible outcome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cydmab" title="cydmab"><img alt="cydmab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cydmab">cydmab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100166/#Comment_100166" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-01T08:52:41+00:00" title="October  1, 2007  8:52AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite><cite>Posted By: cydmab</cite>So the "cookie" here is if you want to do anything, you have to narrate something, and it has to be meaningful enough to satisfy the most picky player at the table.</blockquote>\nYup. In DitV you can't do anything without telling folks what it is you are doing. But that's how narrative works, isn't it?<br/><br/>But there's also the minimum-appropriateness requirement. For example, in bog-standard DnD you can say "I attack" as your narration for an attack. In DitV, you probably can't literally say "I do... err... something" unless everyone agrees that's ok. In particular, you almost surely can't say "I do... err... something related to leatherworking... and bring in dice for my dice for Leatherworker." You are going to be expected to actually say what that something is. <br/><br/>To be clear, I'm not saying this is a bad rule to have a minimum standard of narration. It's probably a good rule overall. But there is at the very least a risk of getting narration that noone actually cares about with the rule. In DnD, if I make an elaborate description of my basic attack, I must be doing it because it matters to me to have that narration in play. But if I were forced to make a witty statement with every narration, it's possible I just don't care. I also don't think it really matters if someone introduces narration that noone cares about. But conflicts noone cares about introduced because there's a rule requesting at least one conflict every 30 minutes, or a conflict brought into being solely to earn a cookie, can have serious consequences, especially if the conflict system takes time and energy to resolve.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100167/#Comment_100167" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-01T08:53:37+00:00" title="October  1, 2007  8:53AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: cydmab</cite>There is no guerentee the producer himself will care about the conflict if he's just trying to meet his conflict-quota so the only hope is that the producer comes up with an idea that tickles the fancy of a player.

I'll let a scene run for a while until I find it -- but I always do.<br/><br/>I'm not sure about the quota thing... Yes, every scene should have a conflict.  But the real standard is interest on the part of the players.  As far as I'm concerned, if there is not interest, by definition, <i>it's not a conflict</i>.  That's the definition of conflict for these games: something the players care about.<br/><br/>That said, I'll have to go check out the "safe negotiations" phase.  I don't remember that (thought I believe it's there) and it sounds like ass.  When I set stakes in PtA half the time I'm fucking Shiva, coming to bring down all sorts of misery and broken-hearts on the PCs if they don't win the conflict.  I can't see the game working otherwise, so you might have found an important hiccup in the text.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100177/#Comment_100177" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-01T09:31:17+00:00" title="October  1, 2007  9:31AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 1, 2007 9:33AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>When I set stakes in PtA half the time I'm fucking Shiva, coming to bring down all sorts of misery and broken-hearts on the PCs if they don't win the conflict.</blockquote>\nAbsolutely.

I have also seen the "meh" response to a lot of PTA conflicts that is named above, because there's often not much "to" a character for someone to grab onto and care about, particularly in pilots. In such cases, a flexible definition of conflict is a godsend, that way the players can just do what their character would want until they figure out what it is that they want.<br/><br/>I suppose the same thing could be true in reverse...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100325">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100325/#Comment_100325" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-01T17:10:53+00:00" title="October  1, 2007  5:10PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I hope to God the Players pick Issues for their characters they care about.

If the pilot or even just a character turns out a bit clunky as a result, that's okay! That's why you don't decide whether to pick up a season or commit to a character until after the pilot's over! <br/><br/>Design-in-play people are just never going to be able to say "yes, yes YES YES I WANT THAT" in the first scene/hour/session/arbitrary time period of play, no matter what you do.

EVEN WHEN THERE IS A CHANCE NOONE CARES.</blockquote>\nJust wanted to say that I have had similar experience with PTA. I've been that Producer fishing around going, "gotta be a conflict around here <i>somewhere</i>. . ." while the other players are telling me, "no, it's all right, we don't need one, let's just move on." I think this is enteriely the result of "request (with advice)," though; "encourage (with cookies)" is off base. 'Cause PTA's cookies are awarded for "stuff someone thinks is cool." They're by <i>definition</i> not about "stuff noone cares about." I thought it was important to get that straight in light of the thread topic. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>As for this difficulty in PTA, I'm not sure how to analyze it or alleviate it. Having issues the players care about is a big deal, for sure. . .in the game I allude to we often had a hard time figuring out what our issue meant in non-abstract terms or how it fit into a scene. But there was something more going on too. . .a difficulty finding the right <i>pacing</i> for scenes and conflicts. Could've just be weak narrative-fu on our part. On the other hand, there might be something to the non-conflict scene idea over in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4392&amp;page=1#Item_1" rel="nofollow">that Sequels thread</a>. We were (especially the other players telling me to relax on the conflictometer) looking for more introspective scenes, or actions/dialogue to set up conflicts for later. So "conflict every scene" just didn't sit right.<br/><br/>Actually, I think that's something Malcolm is getting at with his line of commentary: that indie games encourage a rapid, gun-ho pace of conflictconflictCONFLICT, and sacrifice a more leisurely pace that develops story more richly, so that conflicts have a satisfactory punch when they do occur. This seems especially likely in light of Malcolm's <a href="http://shootingdice.blogspot.com/2006/03/fun-later-you-selfish-git.html" rel="nofollow">"Fun Later"</a> blog post from last year.<br/><br/>Which I think is a fair point; it's entirely possible to be overeager in the search for Conflict, especially if you've endured a lot of flat, passive, conflict-sparse gaming and want to get that sweet nectar you've been missing. ANd focus on instant gratification <i>can</i> wreck a good thing, ruin what could have been satisfying and moving if developed well, lent sufficient weight. That PTA game certainly felt like it could have been well served by being a 9-episode arc instead of 5, for instance.<br/><br/>I guess the question then is, is this a fair criticism of Story Games? I think its a very real risk, though other types of games have their own attendant risks of Unfun, while not being Unfun inherently. I'd say that the spectrum of Story Game design in terms of pacing and dramatic emphasis is sufficiently diverse to provide something for everyone's taste in this area. Though the Indie movement <i>does</i> tend to favor the short-form, leaving those who prefer the long and lingering with greater hurdles in scratching their gaming itch.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100337/#Comment_100337" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-01T18:37:37+00:00" title="October  1, 2007  6:37PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Melinglor</cite>I guess the question then is, is this a fair criticism of Story Games?</blockquote>\nIt's definitely a problem that many folks recognize.

I think it's utter nonsense.<br/><br/><i>Sorcerer</i> play encourages revealed introspection, slow moments and so on, all rewarded with Bonus Dice.  <i>The Mountain Witch</i> depends on the Players doing subtle as well as bold acts that increase or reduce trust among the Ronin.<br/><br/>If people want to go down that road, they certainly can, but it's not the game.  As Andy points out, you could play D&amp;D just hopping from one fight to the next, but why?  (I think checking for traps and secret doors, by the way, had everything to do with slowing the pace between fights.)  Same with Storygames: if you're fixated on getting to the part where you throw down cards, sure, you could play that way.... but why?<br/><br/>So many people have this bug stuck up their anus about Story Games: "Oooh, they have rules for these things, so all you do is move from rule to rule, there's no role playing, there's no setting, it's just mechanic, mechanic, mechanic. It might has well be a board game."  It's nonsense, utter nonsense.  But what are you going to do?  <i>Convince</i> people otherwise?  <br/><br/>I played a great game of PtA at a local con recently.  Now, I had played a good-but-not-great game the day before, so I learned a lot going into the second game.  But I can assure you that in the second game I was willing to let scenes play out till we got to the conflict. I trusted I, as the Producer, would find the conflict when it was time.<br/><br/>There's a lot of silliness running around RPG sites about this stuff.

That's the whole definition.  That's what "addressing Premise" is in actual practice.<br/><br/>I think many people, when they see the word "conflict," assume it means hitting someone over the head with a tire iron, or who "wins" an argument.  But this isn't the case at all.<br/><br/>In the <i>Sorcerer &amp; Sword</i> game I ran at Gateway, one player made a Humanity roll because his character branded his face with the mark the Old Gods put on their human slaves thousands of years ago to tap the powers of Lore and bind a demon.  Another Player had her warrior, born into a family of warriors, break her family's heirloom sword to get a more powerful, demonic sword so she could live up to her family's expectations.  Those are cool character moments that would echo for the rest of a campaign involving those characters.  They were about choice.  They were <i>also</i> about conflict -- the internal conflict a character faced when choosing how to get what he or she wanted. <br/><br/>I'm not sure if the word "conflict" is the right one anymore.  I know how to expand the definition beyond "they fight" but I see a lot of people getting hung up on it.<br/><br/>Revelation of Character is REALLY what we're talking about.  If a guy draws a gun on someone else, why he does it, how he does it, and how far he's willing to go in the next 60 seconds is what the conflict is about.  <br/><br/>That's what a "conflict" in PtA is about, or a Humanity check in Sorcerer, or the Conflict and Trust mechanics in <i>The Mountain Witch</i> and so on.<br/><br/>So, to tie this back into the original post, the purpose of conflict rules and mechanics is to arbitrate the result of a the character's revelation of who they.  In Dogs, a man says, "Well, I'd draw a dagger on you because of what you just said," and what matters is that now we know that whatever that issue is is worthy of drawing a dagger for that character.  In PtA the producer says, "The King has asked you to swallow your pride and do his bidding.  I say your guy blows his stack in front of the servants the minute the King is gone," and soon we'll find out whether our guy blows his stack or not.  In "The Mountain Witch" a ronin might be going down before a fantastical creature, and the other ronin could assist him -- or not -- and now we know more about where these desperate strangers stand in relationship to one another.  In a game of <i>Sorcerer</i>, a man is given a choice of saving a child or sacrificing him to gain the power he needs to finally get the vengeance he has sought for four sessions of play -- we roll Humanity when he chooses to see if he has changed. Bonus dice in <i>Sorcerer</i> work the same way -- the strongest points of play are when a Player reveals something interesting about the character through choice -- those always get dice at my table.<br/><br/>I don't see "cookies" at all.  It's all about revelation of character producing moments that could then go ill or well for a character.  The rules arbitrate the result of that revelation.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100357">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100357/#Comment_100357" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-01T22:31:59+00:00" title="October  1, 2007 10:31PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Christopher:<br/><br/>Perhaps I should have phrased things better (though at some point one wonders how many qualifiers can be attached to a statement before it collapses under its own weight): I'm saying that there's an element in Indie designs, some more than others, that can encourage people (like me!) to go all pedal-to-the-medal, conflict <i>NOW</i>! and skip, as Andy says, the foreplay. I can totally buy that that's a misinterpretation of the true intent of the texts, but the phenomenon exists. The RPGnet discussions you're lamenting are a symptom of that. I'm certainly not going down the "Indie RPGs are just boardgames!" road, but I think it's worth acknowledging that the danger exists, so that we can A) be aware of it and take a balanced approach to narrative pacig and conflict, and <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> set the record straight for others who have, usually in their enthusiasm, gotten the wrong idea. No, we're not going to convince people who've got their minds made up about those "Forge microgames," but I'm not really talking about correcting opponents. I'm talking about guidance for proponents of the games who have gotten overzealous in their pursuit of conflict/Fun Now/cranked to 11 play.<br/><br/>It's all about making games better, right? Well, some of us could use the reminder [raises hand] to back off and let the story flow, to build a proper foundation on which to lay out all that crazy-awesome. Sorry if it sounded like I was churning out a Storygames stereotype.<br/><br/>Good point, by the way, about the conflict/choice dichotomy. It's easy to get caught up in Conflict as the most visceral and immediate medium for choice, but thanks for the reality check.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100359/#Comment_100359" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-01T22:43:29+00:00" title="October  1, 2007 10:43PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Joel,<br/><br/>That was just my crankiness about ignorant Internet postings in general -- not about your post in particular.

I just keep reading craziness things all over the place -- and I've discovered posting about it leads to nothing good.  There's not enough shared experience to get everyone on the same page.

I've never read them or played them!")<br/><br/>You bring up a vital point: people often read the texts as saying jump from conflict to conflict.  I'll say once more, there's a lot to be done about the art and craft of storytelling -- all that stuff in the Fruitful Void.  Rules don't often cover it because it's about art and craft.  It seems too mamb-pamby to be really real.  But this stuff does really matter.  It just doesn't happen to have a mechanic attached.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100360/#Comment_100360" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-01T22:55:19+00:00" title="October  1, 2007 10:55PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 1, 2007 10:58PM by noclue.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: cydmab</cite>If Universally Crappy Outcome is on the table as a possible result of every conflict, then every conflict "matters."

The other day in my BW game, we had a conversation between three Elves.  I as GM was playing an NPC Elf, who is a Relationship of one of the PC Elves, and both PC Elves were present.  The three got into a pretty heated debate that was just about to turn into a Duel of Wits, but they were actually able to reach\xe2\u20ac\u201dthrough sheer, old-fashioned roleplaying\xe2\u20ac\u201dan equitable agreement on how to deal with the situation at hand.  What's particularly interesting about a resolution like that in Burning Wheel is that any promises or agreements made in that scene are systematically non-binding.  It's assholeish and discouraged to r\xc3\xa9n\xc3\xa8ge without reason, of course, but without a Duel of Wits, you're NOT formally bound to any stakes.  So I could have had the NPC go back on his word, and either of my PCs could have done the same.<br/><br/>But nothing in the game rules forced us to roll dice when we didn't want to.  In essence, we had a diceless Conflict, that still lead to interesting results.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cydmab" title="cydmab"><img alt="cydmab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cydmab">cydmab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100495/#Comment_100495" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-02T12:20:31+00:00" title="October  2, 2007 12:20PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 2, 2007 12:20PM by cydmab.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite><br/>Has anyone seen this in a game of DitV?

In a round during conflict with 4 players, I had to do 4 blocks, and one raise; each player had to do only one block and one raise. And not even that if they dropped out of the conflict. On top of that I had to define proto-npc traits on the fly. I was happy to do about half of the narration, but the other half I would of been glad to just say "undefined proto-npc trait, 1d8, I push forward a 5 and a 6 and block your last statement" Since I couldn't do that, I'd come up with something very clipped, short, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cydmab" title="cydmab"><img alt="cydmab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cydmab">cydmab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100503/#Comment_100503" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-02T12:37:58+00:00" title="October  2, 2007 12:37PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Melinglor</cite> I think this is enteriely the result of "request (with advice)," though; "encourage (with cookies)" is off base. </blockquote>\nTo be clear, I don't think I ever claimed that in PTA conflicts are encouraged with cookies... my claim is that request (with advice) can lead to the same problem as encourage (with cookies), or at the very least, PTA's request with advice led for me in my actual play to a type of phenomenon that reminded me of what Malcolm was describing.<br/><br/>I have no personal actual play experience (that I remember) with games that directly encourage conflict with cookies (like the concept of keys, or the game Capes) so I am unable to comment with evidence directly on Malcolm's claims that cookies can cause stale play.

And as I described above, I have had that difficulty with PTA myself.<br/><br/>I <i>can</i> speak for Capes NOT leading to stale play. I've written up those experiences both here and on the RPGsite. In my actual play, we had pretty much engaged and excited narration all around. As I said earlier, I thin Capes is a special case; it's not simply award cookies tacked on like a sidecar to the main engine (as PTA or TSoY's brownie points arguably are). it's a whole economy of different cookies awarded for different things (some for winning, some for losing, frex), and with different benefits. The whole thing's a well-oiled machine, which runs great and, with an engaged player group, produces exactly what it's meant to.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
