Fastaval, held in Hobro, Denmark, is one of the hard cores of Nordic roleplaying, with a strong, supportive and fast-developing community for writing games for serious entertainment. Fastaval's claim to fame is the prestigious Otto competition and the tradition of creatively ambitious chamber larps driven by the competition, but the convention supports a wide variety of games, and it's not always the obvious high art that wins all prizes. <br/><br/>For years now Fastaval has sported a significant minority of foreign visitors, including foreign game contributors. This brings in ideas from abroad, and has also helped spread Nordic/Fastaval-esque inspiration far and wide. We really like it this way, and we have an elite c\xf8rps of tr\xe5nsl\xe5t\xf8rs to smooth the way for foreign visitors and help make sure that most games have english-language runs. Whether you write or not, we want you to come.<br/><br/>The next Fastaval is during Easter 2015, 1.-5. of April. That's quite a way off. Rather closer is the deadline for submission of synopses for games for Fastaval 2015. We'll be back later with details about what a synopsis does and doesn't entail (brief version; more than an elevator pitch, a lot less than your full game, what we want is for you to give us a concrete notion of what your game will be like, so we can pick and choose on an informed basis).<br/><br/>Right now we're asking you to dream up ideas for Fastaval games. Games from one to six hours in length, unless you have a brilliant idea for a 15 minute game or a five day game, in which case we'll listen. Usually they involve five to seven people sitting (or standing) in a room, but again, we'll take a look at whatever ideas you have. Fastaval games tend to be kind of light on crunchy mechanics, unless they aren't. Games can be about just about any topic, and as serious or lighthearted as you like. We demand only that you be serious about making it good.<br/><br/>Eventually, the game will need to be written down so people who are not you can run it, and we'd really like for you to come to Fastaval yourself. Of course, something could come up, but Fastaval will get more out of your game if you're there to speak for it, or at least send a qualified ambassador. And so will you. We want you to plan to come to Fastaval.<br/><br/>What we offer at this point is help. If you're a Fastaval rookie and you think writing for Fastaval sounds intriguing, and you have an idea but you're not too sure how to make it work for Fastaval, write us and we'll hook you up with an experienced Fastaval writer as your sparring partner. Feel free to ask away here, and if you're interested, write us at scenarieansvarlig[at]gmail[dot]com, and we'll have a sparring partner get back to you.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.fastaval.dk/knowhow/scenario-writers-corner/roleplaying-scenarios-for-fastaval-2015/?lang=en" rel="nofollow">Here are some relevant dates</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432793">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432793/#Comment_432793" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-18T09:45:48+00:00" title="May 18, 2014  9:45AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 18, 2014 10:02AM by catty_big.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is it ok to re-submit, in an amended form, a game that was rejected in a previous year?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432794/#Comment_432794" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-18T10:24:16+00:00" title="May 18, 2014 10:24AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd be interested in this.

At the same time, they also have a strong desire to improve, expand, and drive their own state of the art forward with new ideas from new voices.<br/><br/>Even if you can\u2019t attend, Fastaval does some really nifty things for designers. Your game will get played multiple times in short order by a lot of different players, and they will almost all give you written feedback. If you actually can be there in person, they\u2019ll almost all give you feedback face to face as well.<br/><br/>Mo\u2019s game \u2013 Run Them Again \u2013 got run 5 times at Fastaval, and we got feedback from 22+ players and 4 STs. The feedback was all solid, and ranged for short to the point concerns and specific areas that needed development to long talks full of tears about how the scenario touched individual\u2019s lives because of overlap with things they were going through in real life. This level of feedback, and the way it enables you as a designer to see both where feedback clusters and where it diverges across groups and players, is an amazing resource.<br/><br/>The con is also a really good place to get international exposure. Since Fastaval Mo has been contacted by folks in Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Germany, and Ireland about Run Them Again, running it at different cons, and if/when she\u2019s doing a final for sale release candidate. (The Fastaval version will be up for free on the Fastaval Scenario database.)<br/><br/>Finally, Troels himself is an amazing guy. There are a lot of really experienced, skillful scenario and LARPwrites who are willing to act as sparring partners, advisors, and general help in order to bridge the gap between the Danish tradition and various North American traditions. These folks are serious about not leaving you alone and working with you got get a quality scenario done.<br/><br/>Those of you who know me know I rarely say nice things. I\u2019m saying nice things about Fastaval, and about this offer from Troels. Jump all over this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432863/#Comment_432863" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-20T09:06:26+00:00" title="May 20, 2014  9:06AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 20, 2014 9:23AM by catty_big.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How detailed do the proposals have to be?
