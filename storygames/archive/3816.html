The resolution mechanic works like this: You have three kinds of game stats: backgrounds, passions and incentives. Backgrounds are pretty much skills; stuff you're good at or resources you have. There are six passions, and they're the same to all characters: wrath, bloodthirst, madness, lust, stress and angst. Finally, there are incentives, which are the topic of this post. Each kind of stat has a value in the form of a die type, from d4 and up to d12 (think Savage Worlds, Agon etc). When rolling in a conflict, you can use up to one stat from each category. You roll the die in question for each stat and choose the highest. This is the result of your roll, and also determines which stat <i>dominates.</i><br/><br/>If the background dominates, you mark it off on your character sheet. You can't use it anymore (for the rest of the session or until some de-marking mechanic has done its job). If the passion dominates, you raise it one die-type. A passion raised above d12 is bad news indeed; you temporarily or permanently succumb to the passion.<br/><br/>* * *<br/><br/>So far, so good. But what about these "incentives"? Well, that's what I haven't figured out, and where I'm hoping you might have some ideas. <br/><br/>Incentives, as I imagine them, are things that can pull the character into stories. They act both as "disadvantages" that can place the character in trouble, as plot-hooks that can pull the character into action and, from the point of view of the player, as interest flags to tell the GM which kind of stories the character should be involved in. An incentive could be something so blatantly proactive as "wants to be the first man on the moon" as well as something equally reactive, like "hated by the mayor" or "alcoholic" (these are not, btw, setting-specific examples <img alt=":p" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/tongue.png" title=":p"/>). <br/><br/>I've got a wishlist of things I'd like the rules to be able to handle:\n<ul>\n<li>When incentives come into play, the player gets awarded, much like in SotC or, I would suspect, many other similar games.</li>\n<li>Rolling for incentives should mean taking a risk, much like rolling for backgrounds means taking the risk that it will be marked off, or rolling for passions means taking the risk that it will increase. If the incentive dominates the roll, something bad should happen</li>\n<li>Rolling for incentives should somehow tie in to how the story-effects of the inventives come into play.</li>\n<li>Preferrably: bringing incentives into play gives experience</li>\n<li>Some sort of mechanical representation of the struggle to reach the goals inherent in some incentives, like the "first man on the moon" example above. (I'm not sure about this one)</li>\n</ul>However, I'm not sure how to implement this wish list. Here's an idea:\n<ul>\n<li>When the incentive takes part in the story, you get to make a mark next to it on your character sheet. You may then roll it in conflicts, but when it dominates, you have to erase the mark and can't use it any more (until it enters the story once again)</li>\n<li>The reverse is also possible; you can roll for the incentive, but if it dominates, you have to narrate how it fucks things up for the character in some way.</li>\n<li>Either way, you get XP</li>\n</ul>Any better ideas?<br/><br/>/Kalle                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_85721">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thark" title="thark"><img alt="thark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i99ronhe.island.liu.se/avatars/eyebrow32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thark">thark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85721/#Comment_85721" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-06T06:33:33+00:00" title="August  6, 2007  6:33AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kalle,<br/><br/>As I warned you, this is not very constructive. (I tend to work from a method of followup questions to get the original questioner to figure out for themselves what they want, but this doesn't really lead to any new ideas...)\n<blockquote>Rolling for incentives should mean taking a risk, much like rolling for backgrounds means taking the risk that it will be marked off, or rolling for passions means taking the risk that it will increase. If the incentive dominates the roll, something bad should happen</blockquote>\nWith an undesired side effect no matter which die dominates, you've got a resource management mechanic (which I'm proceeding to assume is deliberate).<br/><br/>Now, being the sort of person I am, I think it's equally important to think about the in-fiction consequences of the effects and not just get caught up in which numbers get fiddled around. Passions seem rather straightforward in this, and backgrounds I guess the straightforward "yay, you do it" (for a successful roll, anyway). An incentive, then, would imply that something significant happens/changes with regards to the incentive--but, the problem with this is, if you're bringing the incentive into the conflict, doesn't that already rather imply that the outcome of the conflict is something that's going to affect the incentive?<br/><br/>This leads to: How strongly is the bringing in of things tied to what is going on? Eg, do you only get to bring in the incentive when it's already established to be relevant, or do you bring it in out of the blue and now it somehow enters the fiction? (If the latter, it seems more valid to have incentive dominating leading to a complication--by bringing it in where it wasn't necessarily before, you're taking the risk that it causes you problems.)<br/><br/>Frankly, to my mind, having an in-fiction complication result is more interesting than one more way of having your stat sheet affected.<br/><br/>(You do however get the issue that bringing in an incentive and having it not dominate would in this case potentially mean that it affected the situation in a non-problematic way even though you may well have lost the conflict.)<br/><br/>Also worth considering, (how) does the effect (of either of the three) interact with a won conflict vs a lost conflict?\n<blockquote>When the incentive takes part in the story, you get to make a mark next to it on your character sheet. You may then roll it in conflicts, but when it dominates, you have to erase the mark and can't use it any more (until it enters the story once again)</blockquote>\nThis sounds rather like rather the same effect as with a background (except for refreshing differently), and if you have passions working differently you probably want all three to differ.
