This is the new thread.<br/><br/>This thread is about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barriers_to_entry" rel="nofollow">barriers to entry</a> with respect to gaming systems.  Specifically I'm talking about this sort of thing:<br/><br/>"Sure, we <i>could</i> start playing Houses of the Blooded... but there's a bunch of new rules to learn, and a bunch of setting to get up to speed on, and after all that maybe wouldn't it be better to stick with something we already know all about, like D&amp;D?"<br/><br/>So, hit me with your ideas about what sorts of barriers to entry are present in games, and what we can do to lower them.<br/><br/>(Or if you'd rather talk about pretty much anything else on that Wikipedia page, that's good too; there's all sorts of good stuff there.)<br/><br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Roger                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252969/#Comment_252969" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-26T17:04:12+00:00" title="January 26, 2010  5:04PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This has struck me about many games lately too (well, okay, not just lately, but it seems to be happening more often lately). For me, there's a lot of games out there that conceptually and mechanically look brilliant, and some of them I've really enjoyed playing, but their setting has always driven me away, or made it difficult for me to share the game with my friends.<br/>\nIt seems a lot of games require an intimate knowledge of a particular series of books, or previous games, or certain cultures or periods of history, etc., and you need to invest a lot of time and brain power to get familiar enough to know what's going on. Everything from Warhammer Fantasy (2nd Ed), Dark Heresy, Vampire the Masquerade, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and hell, even Star Wars, require additional geekery to really be an active participant in the game, or so it seems to me. And that seems like a major barrier to enjoying the game overall. At least with a GM's original campaign world (particularly if the players can help narrate and create what that world becomes), you don't have to pull out sourcebooks left and right to explain new concepts...instead you just describe them.<br/>\nI had a hell of a time with a Warhammer Fantasy campaign, where even though I was the GM, I was the only person at the table not to have read any of the fiction or played the miniatures game. I enjoyed the rules, and wanted to play it as more of a generic fantasy game, but things were quickly bogged down with mutant hunts, warpstone collecting, and burning heretics. Even worse when a few players kept insisting that certain people or events couldn't be allowed or should be allowed, based on the timeline of the Warhammer Fantasy world.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, yeah, that tends to make it pretty hard to start up another game, much less enjoy one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_252973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252973/#Comment_252973" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-26T17:17:03+00:00" title="January 26, 2010  5:17PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sometimes barriers to entry are good - they provide you with a strong challenge up front.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252981/#Comment_252981" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-26T17:59:30+00:00" title="January 26, 2010  5:59PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's an interesting point; I look at some of the games my group has played and I suspect that some of them would not have been as good if they had lower barriers to entry.  But because they were a challenge to learn, a challenge to pitch to the group, and a challenge to run, we couldn't dog it.  We had to really <i>want</i> to play those games, more than we wanted to play something familiar, and so we all dug a little deeper and invested a little more in it.<br/><br/>It's not a perfect situation, but what in this sad broken-down world ever is?  It might be nice if some things were easier, but if they aren't and if you decide you'd rather not deal with them right now since you can just have fun doing something familiar instead, that's fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_252985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252985/#Comment_252985" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-26T19:17:43+00:00" title="January 26, 2010  7:17PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I think it's fair to say that barriers to entry are not always a bad thing.<br/><br/>They can work as barriers to exit, as well -- "I just spent five years learning this set of D&amp;D rules and I'm not going to throw that all away."<br/><br/>As far as big crazy settings go... in my experience these haven't been as much of a problem as I was expecting.

The problem is that there are  bunch of new gamers and inexperienced gamers who just won't get it.<br/><br/>On one side I've got the "barrier to exit", these guys don't want to leave the system they've been playing for years...on the other side I've got "barrier to entry".<br/><br/>I can think of some great game systems that would be quick for everyone to learn, games that would put everyone on an even footing. But the experienced D&amp;D players don't want to leave their comfort zone too much...I guess I can be glad their letting me run a setting of my own devising.<br/><br/>At the moment, I am the barrier warden, trying to lower the threshold to a point where the new players can come in (while not lowering it to a point where the gameplay is unrecognisable as D&amp;D). It's going to be a fun balancing act.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253089/#Comment_253089" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-27T08:30:51+00:00" title="January 27, 2010  8:30AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Judd, I think there's a couple of things going on.<br/><br/>For one, we've got the sunk cost fallacy.  If someone spends a year mastering a game, they're going to become more loyal to it and more resistant to dropping it in favour of something else.<br/><br/>For another, we've got the (I believe) well-known effect that free games get less play than games people pay for.  Paying for a game is a barrier to entry.  There's also some evidence that people will believe a $100 product is inherently better than a $10 product, even if they're just the same product with a different price tag.<br/><br/>There's probably other effects out there too, but those are the ones that come to mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse" title="xenomouse"><img alt="xenomouse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z36/xenomouse/tophat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse">xenomouse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253115/#Comment_253115" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-27T09:58:28+00:00" title="January 27, 2010  9:58AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 27, 2010 9:58AM by xenomouse.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Barriers to entry that have stopped me in the past:\n<ul><li>Financial cost:<ul><li>How much do I need to buy in?</li><li>What is the long term cost?

I don't mean that they are one-shot, but rather that a relative preponderance either seek a climax and endgame (an important part of a story, after all) or adhere to a fairly rigid (and thus more focused) episodic style of play.<br/><br/>That's just a very general observation from my limited experience with story games, but it does contrast with my impression of more mainstream RPGs, which seem to suffer the most from Stick-With-It! syndrome. I suppose that this is partially a result of the large financial investment that mainstream commercial RPGs demand, but it might also be related to the brand-loyalty trend among the same groups. (Is it just me, or do many DnD players incessantly rag on the White Wolf gamers and <i>vice versa</i>?) Whatever the cause, Stick-With-It! attitudes seem more commonplace outside of the story game community.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse" title="xenomouse"><img alt="xenomouse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z36/xenomouse/tophat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse">xenomouse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253146/#Comment_253146" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-27T10:43:29+00:00" title="January 27, 2010 10:43AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite><cite>Posted By: xenomouse</cite>But if they don't stick with it, what was accomplished?</blockquote>\nTangent: What if games were designed to only be played acouple of times, so it doesn't matter if they stick with it?True.

However, that's not always the case.  <br/><br/>Suppose that I wanted to maximize customer satisfaction.  I know that customers of type X will be dissatisfied with my game after the first few session.  Rather than making it easier for customers of type X to get started on my game, I would prefer to make it more <i>difficult</i> for customers of type X to get started on my game, making it clear to them up front that this is not the game for them.  So, for example, suppose I have a math-heavy strategic wargame.  I can't cut out the math without fundamentally changing what the game is, and some people really enjoy it.  I want to create a barrier to entry on the game so that people who aren't into math won't try it.  Similarly, if I make a game that I think works best with a lot of time investment (like an in-depth strategy game), I may not want people coming into it for a quick afternoon's fun.  I want to make a barrier against people who aren't willing to put in that time investment.  <br/><br/>If you don't assume that I want as many people as possible to try my game, then you can see all sorts of reasons to create barriers to entry.  So, for example, I might want to make a Lord of the Rings game that's fun and accessible for kids who haven't read Tolkien and/or have only seen the a movie or two.  However, I might also want to make a Lord of the Rings game that is specifically for fans of Tolkien's written work.  Who my target audience is suggests what I might want for barriers to entry.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253153">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse" title="xenomouse"><img alt="xenomouse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z36/xenomouse/tophat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse">xenomouse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253153/#Comment_253153" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-27T10:50:40+00:00" title="January 27, 2010 10:50AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite><cite>Posted By: xenomouse</cite>It's usually not too difficult to get someone to sit down to play a couple sessions of a game, which might be considered an entry.

I was implying (and obviously not very well) that "sticking with it" meant they were having fun and wanted to be there.  Maybe I should have said something about a time-to-fun variable.  How long does it take for me to get into / have fun with this system.  Sometimes a little ramp up is required.  Sometimes a lot is required.  I know people who will give up on a game within 15 minutes of starting if they aren't having fun, and I know people who were willing to play a couple sessions waiting for things to get fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253156/#Comment_253156" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-27T10:54:35+00:00" title="January 27, 2010 10:54AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: xenomouse</cite><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite><cite>Posted By: xenomouse</cite>But if they don't stick with it, what was accomplished?</blockquote>\nTangent: What if games were designed to only be played acouple of times, so it doesn't matter if they stick with it?True.

Basically, the only people making Coke is the Coke Company, so they have a monopoly on making Coke.  This used to be true for D&amp;D... but one of the clever things about the whole 'retro-clone' thing is that now there's quite a number of companies producing products that the average consumer (of that product) is likely to think of as D&amp;D.<br/><br/>When it comes to branding, I'm a little surprised we haven't yet reached the point of "Vincent Baker presents:  Tinky Winky, a game by Joe Q.
