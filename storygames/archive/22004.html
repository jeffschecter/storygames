                    Hey all,<br/><br/>I’m setting up a Patreon for zine that collects games, hacks, poems, LARPs, etc. that were previously unavailable in English. Smaller stuff is preferred since I’ll be aiming for a 32 page, B&amp;W, digest sized zine I think and quick turn around would keep everyone involved from burn out.<br/><br/>I’m looking for an army of translators active in game scenes that can pitch me games they’d like to see translated so I can pay them to do that. I don’t mind helping with editing and localizing so you’d by no means have to be a professional translator. <br/><br/>I’d pay translators minimum 8 cents a word, maybe a negotiated flat fee for a game poem or more cents for something super grueling and/or technical.<br/><br/>The original authors would get a royalty cut from copies sold in perpetuity. I’m thinking 2% per page taken up by their work in the zine, with a min of 2%.<br/><br/>If you or anyone you know is interested in being a translator who can approach game authors to get their works translated for me I’d love to hear from you! My email is samjokopublishing@gmail.com, twitter handle is kylejsimons.<br/><br/>I’ve also been trying to think of a cool name for the zine so any ideas here would be helpful as well! I think a one-word name would be best.                </div>
