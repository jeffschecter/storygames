This is my first post to Story Games.<br/>\n<br/>\nI\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve been thinking about a possible game I want to write lately. I figured I'd throw out what (little) I have so far for thoughts/opinions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game is tentatively called <b>Grand Tour</b>, and it is a game about Travel: the pre-trip hype, the excitement/trepidation of the actual tour, and the bummer of coming back home.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe players take the role of Travelers, the people going on the trip. These can be of background/age/race/religion/etc. just like the travelers one meets on the road. Certain groups make some sense (high school/university graduates on a post-graduation trip, young and seasoned hostel veterans, retiree adventurers) especially once one figures in the factor of the Tour (see below).<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer characters would have a combination of hard and loose stats. For example, hard states include things like Endurance measures a Traveler\xe2\u20ac\u2122s energy levels and fatigue as the trip goes on; Resources measures a Traveler\xe2\u20ac\u2122s cash (probably pre-set at Tour creation?); and Stress measures both the initial amount of stress a Traveler begins the Tour with (you know, why one is taking a vacation for in the first place) and also the amount one accumulates as a party travels together, getting on each other\xe2\u20ac\u2122s nerves. Stress could be a sliding scale with Relaxation, with scores changing during play. Loose stats include player-defined Traits that define the Traveler (sort of like Aspects, if you will) and include things like who is the party clown, the stickler for schedule, the bar hopper, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe skeleton upon which Grand Tour is played is, well, the Tour, and this gets constructed at the table much like a communal character. A Tour has stats as well, starting with Name: as simple as Cosmos Italy or Rick Steves Best of Europe, or imaginative like The Transfiguration Tour or The Hellhoot Adventure. (BTW, these are the names of 2 of the 4 trips I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve taken to Europe with family/friends.) The Name kind of defines also if the Tour is Fixed/Pre-packaged, or if it is Custom/Free-form, with this decision affecting some of the stats below.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we have hard stats like Time (how long is the tour), Schedule (the trip itinerary which the Travelers will either strive to follow or blow to the four winds), Mobility (a measure of how much one has to move to hit all the locations in the schedule - interacts with a Traveler\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Stress and Resources), and Rigidity/Flexibility (maybe a sliding scale - how fixed is the itinerary, with pre-packaged tours being very much towards the rigid side, and free-form ones being more towards the flexible side, though there can be combinations).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game would be played in a series of Phases, each part broken into parts and scenes. Phase 1 is the Pre-Trip phase, which includes Traveler and Tour creation, as well as defining all the variables for the particular tour and the establishment of the shared story of the Travelers.<br/>\n<br/>\nPhase 2 is the trip itself, with each location in the schedule being a part, and sub-locations being scenes. So for example, if you are doing a Tour of Paris (6 days), and your schedule includes the Louvre, Versailles (hey, a side trip!) and the Eiffel Tower, Paris in general would be a Part and the Louvre would be a scene, Versailles would be a scene, etc. This is still kind of loose, because there are sub-locations you can combo up (see Napoleon\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Tomb and the Eiffel Tower the same day) and others which could take a whole day if not more (the Louvre ), thus needed more than one scene for the sub-location.<br/>\n<br/>\nPhase 3 is the Post-Trip phase, in which the Travelers return home and may have to deal with the effects of post-tour funk or Bummer (this depends on the individual Traveler - some people comparmentalize their vacations and don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t let it affect their lives, while others take some time to gather back what they left behind, like me), or even if they returned at all!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you can see, this still needs lots of work and thought, but I figured I\xe2\u20ac\u2122d put it out there to make it real, to stake a claim that I am doing this (mainly for myself). And to fish for thoughts.  ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nHave at it.<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nDaniel M.

I would suggest you consider writing it with an eye to enabling a number of different kinds of settings (travels in spaaaaaaace, fantasy travels, etc.). I'm thinking here of what I have heard one of the draws for <a href="http://playcollective.org/?page_id=8" rel="nofollow">Emily Care Boss's</a> games, where for example you can play superheroes on a date, or a date between Jedi trainees, or whatever.<br><br>I am also uncomfortable with the notion that coming home must necessarily be a bummer. The Joseph-Campbell-like arc of the archetypal travel story would have the return home a bittersweet affair, or even a longed-for one.<br><br>I think you could also have fun with giving incentives for players to voluntarily introduce complications for reward. A big thing about trips is that all the things that horribly go wrong and make you miserable will be the things you remember fondly.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_75085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez" title="Daniel_M_Perez"><img alt="Daniel_M_Perez" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dmperez.com/offline/avatars/danny_avatar_03_32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez">Daniel_M_Perez</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75085/#Comment_75085" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-12T06:51:42+00:00" title="June 12, 2007  6:51AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Robert, thanks for the comments.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter I finished typing my initial notes above, I kept thinking about it and the idea of making it a generic engine to portray any kind of Tour came up, much like what you describe, and I like that. I guess in many regards the process is similar whether you are going for 2 weeks on the Best of Europe or 2 weeks on the Best of Gondor.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn your second point, speaking from experience only, coming home is always a bittersweet experience: you are so tired from being on the road and away from the familiar that you welcome your personal space again. But then I hit the post-trip funk for a couple of days (though the length, I've discovered, is directly proportional to how long the Tour was) and I want to be on the road again. There is a dichotomy between the wish to return to the familiar and to stay in the process of adventure, which as I think about it, meshes with what you are saying about Campbell. I'm gonna check into this further.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour last suggestion is great; I'd been wondering how to integrate the randomness of travel, especially of the many things that can go wrong, yet make for those memorable moments (<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.destination-earth.com/stories/dmp-antrimcoast.html" rel="nofollow">like getting stuck at the bottom of the Giant's Causeway as night fell and a storm arrived...</a>). I also thought of having other players throw in the monkeywrenches into the mix; now I just have to think of a reward for this behavior. I mean, complications would affect things like Resources, Endurance, Stress, mess with the Schedule and be subject to a Tour's Ridigity/Flexibility, but then again, they would rack up on Memorability (a new possible stat?), which would probably be one of the scores you want to see high by endgame.<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly,\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">A big thing about trips is that all the things that horribly go wrong and make you miserable will be the things you remember fondly.</div>\n</blockquote>\nQFT!!!  :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75086/#Comment_75086" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-12T07:05:17+00:00" title="June 12, 2007  7:05AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What's QFT? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br><br>I like the idea of a Memorability stat or additive pool (Nostalgia?) quite a bit. Perhaps building up enough of this will let you "level up" by increasing your stats for future trips. Great memories of past trips build your enthusiasm for future trips. If you work it right you might be able to get a blackjack-like thing going where if you get too bummed out during the trip you won't be as enthusiastic to go again, but if you don't have enough stuff go wrong, you won't get bonuses later.<br><br>I like the idea of self-introduced challenge, but perhaps stuff introduced by other players is even better. There's a design precept somewhere that says that the same person should never be the author of and resolution to adversity. In fact I think this is a game that could work very well without a GM (or, to be more accurate, with distributed GM responsibilities).                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_75088">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez" title="Daniel_M_Perez"><img alt="Daniel_M_Perez" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dmperez.com/offline/avatars/danny_avatar_03_32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez">Daniel_M_Perez</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75088/#Comment_75088" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-12T07:12:08+00:00" title="June 12, 2007  7:12AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            QFT = Quoted for truth.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll come back to reply to your comments; I need to leave for work now.

And it didn't help that Katy didn't see fit to shower the night before. . . ."<br><br>The entire game could be in flashback, or you could have this as scene-framing introductions. The person whose turn it is to start a scene might say, "Oh my god do you remember that smelly train ride?" and then go into "live" roleplaying. You might also use Polaris's ideas of ritual phrases, so start a scene with "Remember when?" and end with some kind of button about what that meant to you(r character).<br><br>--<br><br>Please tell me if I'm "helping" too much and being pushy.

If you're interested in some mechanical inspiration, you might take a look at an <a href="http://ericjboyddesigns.com/Documents/The%20Committee%20v6.0.pdf" rel="nofollow">old draft</a> of my upcoming pulp-inspired game "The Committee for the Exploration of Mysteries." The premise of play is recounting the tale of an expedition to some exotic location from which the characters have just returned. It's got distributed GM authority (GMless) and is all told in flashback. <br><br/>The slide show angle to kick off flashbacks is keen, and I like the idea of giving attributes to the tour itself. For tours of actual places, it would be neat if you could integrate the use of travel guides into the rules - perhaps allowing players to derive bonuses for pulling out colorful facts, or have the order in which locations are laid out in the book affect the progression of the tour. Having a resource on hand would really help players who want to play a tour of Italy but have never been there. Kind of gives the game an educational element, too.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_75164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75164/#Comment_75164" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-12T11:54:12+00:00" title="June 12, 2007 11:54AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a neat idea, Eric.

Boyd</cite>Daniel,<br>Your travel game idea sounds very entertaining, and I could see taking it in a variety of directions. If you're interested in some mechanical inspiration, you might take a look at an<a href="http://ericjboyddesigns.com/Documents/The%20Committee%20v6.0.pdf" rel="nofollow">old draft</a>of my upcoming pulp-inspired game "The Committee for the Exploration of Mysteries." The premise of play is recounting the tale of an expedition to some exotic location from which the characters have just returned. It's got distributed GM authority (GMless) and is all told in flashback.</br></blockquote>\nThanks for the link, Eric. I've printed it out and I'll read through it. I can tell you that I like your premise, and yes, that's sort of what I'm going for here, though as I said above, I haven't quite decided if the game will be in a recount or as-it-happens format. Either way, your concept alone helps me to visualize what I'm trying to achieve better, so it certainly is a lot of help.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric J. Boyd</cite>The slide show angle to kick off flashbacks is keen, and I like the idea of giving attributes to the tour itself. For tours of actual places, it would be neat if you could integrate the use of travel guides into the rules - perhaps allowing players to derive bonuses for pulling out colorful facts, or have the order in which locations are laid out in the book affect the progression of the tour. Having a resource on hand would really help players who want to play a tour of Italy but have never been there. Kind of gives the game an educational element, too.</blockquote>\nI had thought about probably integrating physical artifacts into the play experience (maybe as a variant, to account for anyone who may not have things like this handy, or so that the game has the potential to be played on the spot), if only because I think these would bring a lot of color to the game. Not just a guidebook, though, but also bus/train stubs, Rail passes, airline tickets, attraction tickets, branded memorabilia from a lodging or restaurant: these things, if used in play, could grant a small extra bonus, simply for the ambiance they bring (likewise, if framed as a non-mundane tour, say fantasy or sci-fi inspired, crated artifacts could also have the same effect).<br><br>I have to tell you, all, that the thoughts you've brought to bear have helped a lot of solidify this idea in my head, enough that I am convinced that there is a way to pull off the game and that it is something I definitely should pursue. Thank you for that. I will continue to take your suggestions to heart and molding the notes I'm taking into something more concrete I can start organizing into a semblance of a game that can be playtested and picked apart.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75202/#Comment_75202" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-12T15:55:27+00:00" title="June 12, 2007  3:55PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was imagining using the slideshow as a narrative structure, but I suppose you could also use an actual slideshow.

Perhaps whatever score these tokens end up tracking could get an extra +1 per token spent in a story-enhancing way, be it as a new fact or complication. This would drive people to use the tokens, and accepting a token would mean you later have more tokens to affect someone else's narrative.<br/><br/>Actually, now that I think about it, maybe it is by spending tokens that you gain control of the next narrative scene. This would drive people to throw facts/complications at the narrating player, and others to try to (in effect) bid over the other players. <br/><br/>So, for example, Player 1 frames the intial scene, Player 2 throws in a fact, then Player 4 decides to bid over Player 2 with a complication (maybe paying one token per player bidding before him, so 2 in this case). Just as Player 1 is about to accept Player 4's complication (thus getting 2 tokens), Player 3 chimes in with a new fact, bidding over Players 2 and 4, thus paying 3 tokens; this makes it very attractive to Player 1. Player 2 decides to bow out and Player 4, as much as he'd like to, just doesn't have enough tokens to top Player 3's bid. Player 1 accepts Player 3's new fact, takes his 3 tokens, and now Player 3 has narrative control for the next scene.<br/><br/>I see your point about competition and ill-feelings. My gut reaction is that, given the lighthearted nature of the game, it would take a very grumpy person to get to this point, but I understand there are people out there like that. I also understand I cannot control every player's reaction, so right my only thought is to address that with a very explicit, "Don't be a dick, you're all playing this game to have fun."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75409/#Comment_75409" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-13T11:32:37+00:00" title="June 13, 2007 11:32AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the positive comments about MY!<br/><br/>As for stopping people from being knobs, what I meant more was I am always cautious of creating rules which might invite or encourage that by accident.

I'd appreciate your thoughts on it:\n<blockquote><b><i>Grand Tour: A Game About Traveling</i></b> is meant to be a light-hearted, fun game of shared storytelling focused on creating the experience of traveling on a tour, whether it is pre-packaged or custom-made, real or imaginary. Players take the role of Travelers, and together they create Tour, engaging in a group dynamic where one player narrates an event in the tour and other have the option of accepting the event, adding a fact to it, or throwing a complication. The object of the game is to go through the tour, racking up Memorability points without getting Burnt Out or having more Stress than you started with.</blockquote>\nAside from this, this morning I had this idea about adding a stat to the Traveler's sheet: aside from Traits that define the character's personality/idiosyncracies, I thought about adding a stat called Passion. This is a one-word Aspect-like trait that defines what is your main interest during the trip. At the moment I am thinking of making a defined list of 5 or 6 traits, things like History, Culture, Party, Rest. By choosing one, you are declaring what is your main interest during the trip, what you most hope to see/do. <br/><br/>Passions also engender conflict, both in terms of complications and PvP; e.g. say a Party PC wants to go bar-hopping at night, while a Culture PC wants to check out a small exhibition down the street - this could simply split the party up or force these two Travelers into a conflict of wills to see who sways the rest of the group. This kind of thing could be tied up to how much Stress you have/generate as well, providing a mechanical way to simulate those moments when people who have been traveling together for a while, regardless of how good friends they are, bash heads and possibly come to blows. This is very off-the-top-of-my-head, but I wanted to throw it out there for later reference.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76162">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez" title="Daniel_M_Perez"><img alt="Daniel_M_Perez" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dmperez.com/offline/avatars/danny_avatar_03_32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez">Daniel_M_Perez</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76162/#Comment_76162" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-16T22:54:39+00:00" title="June 16, 2007 10:54PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a point of reference, you can check out the <a href="http://mastermines.wordpress.com/projects/grand-tour/" rel="nofollow">Grand Tour project page</a> over at <a href="http://mastermines.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">Master Mines</a>, a feedback group I joined along with Ryan Macklin and Paul Tevis, among others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76182">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76182/#Comment_76182" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-17T06:02:24+00:00" title="June 17, 2007  6:02AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 17, 2007 6:03AM by DanielSolis.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Highmoon</cite>two Travelers into a conflict of wills to see who sways the rest of the group.</blockquote>\nHave you watched the Amazing Race, much? You see the "traveling companions butting heads" dynamic constantly. My only concern about the Culture, History and Rest passions is that they might not be as immediately interesting to play out as a party scene would be. Here's my idea of how to solve this:<br/><br/>Once the group decides an activity, you play it out for a little bit until complications are introduced by the player whose traveler wanted to do an alternative activity. <br/><br/>So let's say Bob's character Professor Bottomsworth wants to see the fascinating dancing rituals of a local tribe. (A culture activity) But Alice's character Natasha would rather just go to the local discotheque and party the night away. (A party activity) They ask for a vote from the remaining members of the group, the professor wins. The group goes to watch the local ritual.<br/><br/>Now, because Natasha wanted to do something different, Alice can introduce complications to the activity. These don't necessarily need to be Natasha's fault, but they do affect the entire group, Natasha included. Such complications can include:<br/><br/>"A member of the group looks exactly like a statue of this tribe's deity." <br/>"We've deeply offended the tribe's chief somehow."<br/>"You've fallen in love with a woman who's about to sacrifice herself."<br/><br/>At first blush, this might just sound like a recipe for hostile sour grapes, but because the complications affect the <i>entire</i> group, I'd imagine there'd be less "Man, I wanted to party instead of this boring crap!" and more "Ooh! Now we can have hijinks!" As a matter of fact, if everyone agrees on one activity, that means no one could introduce complications, so you'd glaze over that scene with a single sentence like.  "The dance ritual passes uneventfully." and then you go on to the next leg of the journey.<br/><br/>Anyhoo, this is a very cool concept for a game. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez" title="Daniel_M_Perez"><img alt="Daniel_M_Perez" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dmperez.com/offline/avatars/danny_avatar_03_32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez">Daniel_M_Perez</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76213/#Comment_76213" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-17T09:28:53+00:00" title="June 17, 2007  9:28AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've caught a few seasons of The Amazing Race; it's one of my favorite shows.  ;-)<br/>The traveling companions butting head thing is one of those constants of travel that everyone can relate to. Now all I need to do is be able to also tap into the cool times as well.<br/><br/>Mike Sugarbaker brought something up over at Master Mines that has me thinking now:<br/>He said that so far, if you substitue the word Story for Tour pretty much anywhere it appears, the result is the same, i.e. the system I've come up with so far is a nice story engine, but so far it doesn't address Travel itself. He's right, actually, to which I could only reply that I want to get a basic idea of the mechanical skeleton I'll be using before I drop the thematic muscles on it. But I am thinking what are the core elements of Travel that make it so that I need to then convert into mechanics for the system.<br/><br/>Thinking...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_78647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez" title="Daniel_M_Perez"><img alt="Daniel_M_Perez" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dmperez.com/offline/avatars/danny_avatar_03_32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez">Daniel_M_Perez</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78647/#Comment_78647" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-28T19:51:50+00:00" title="June 28, 2007  7:51PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://mastermines.wordpress.com/2007/06/28/gt-the-big-3/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Originally posted at Master Mines.</a><br/><br/><b>Grand Tour: The Big Three</b><br/><br/>So I finally got around to answering these! Next step, first draft.\n<ol>\n<li><strong>What is your game about?<br/></strong><em>Grand Tour</em> is a game about travel: getting a group together, planning a tour, taking the trip and reminiscing about it afterwards.</li>\n<li><strong>How is your game about that?<br/></strong><em>Grand Tour</em> includes phases representing the stages of a trip as described above. Character generation results in the Travelers, who then cooperate to create a Tour, who then engage in shared narrative to describe the events of the trip itself. During this phase, players can narrate, add facts or throw in complications, seeking to rack up Memorability while avoiding Burnout and/or arguments that could make it a trip to forget.</li>\n<li><strong>What behaviors will your game reward?<br/></strong><em>Grand Tour</em> rewards a shared narrative experience where different players all combine to tell one story by awarding Memorability points to a scene based on the initial narration, and any added facts and/or complications thrown in. Players are encouraged to work together towards the creation of a memorable trip, which always include some good and not-so-good times, and penalizes players who try to hog the spotlight, or set out to create a narration where everything goes wrong, by awarding Burnout points.</li>\n</ol>\nI'm not entirely convinced with what I wrote, but it does give me a clearer vision of what I want to achieve.
