One is build a "Player's Package" that I hand out during the first game session.<br/><br/>Do you do anything like this?  What do you collect in it?<br/>Here's my past efforts:<br/><br/>-  I create duplicate copies of whatever Player Package I create, almost on an assembly line.  Sometimes I'll change the color of the package (the holder)  other times I've put labels with the PC or Player name on them.<br/><br/>-  some sort of holder:  Most often I buy 1/2" ring binder usually the kind that you can slide in paper cover in the plastic front/back which I will usually slip in a "title page" for the campaign (a pic with the game logo) or their character sheet (which can then be used with dry erase markers!) or sometimes rule cheat sheets or a map of the setting.  Recently I found some neat 2" pouches with zipper at the top a sort of material with rigid interior.  For shorter campaigns I've bought simple paper folders or manilla folders.  Or for flavor with modern games I've used office envelope folders.<br/><br/>-  inside I'll usually include some sort of player primer:  notes on the setting style/theme,  history of the setting,  timeline,  NPC notes,  rumor sheets,  new character sheets,  maps of the setting,  pictures,  etc...<br/><br/>-  If I've planned for the adventure well enough I might include specially written handouts:  like presidential/king letters,  notes to kick off the adventures,  specially made newspapers,  quotes or verses or texts that hint at the plot,  note pads of paper or graph paper,  etc...<br/><br/>-  sometimes I'll include things like:  a new pencil, pen, a die for the game,  or other neat little things for flavor.    <br/><br/>-  recently I found some neat/cheap small "locker" marker wipe boards with a marker attached, I put these in the player packs for them to use to write private notes in-game.  <br/><br/>-  for my My Life with the Batman (My Life with Master hack) I made a specialty rule book custome made PDF for the game.<br/><br/>-  I also allow players to either leave their Player Packs at my apt. (where we game) in a special magazine rack that they know won't get misplaced.  But overall once given the pack is THEIRS, so I like when players are inspired by the game enough to want to take the pack home to look at over the week.  <br/><br/><br/>--------------------------<br/>So that's the packs I've done...<br/><br/>One thing I'm thinking about is what goes into your INFORMATON portion?  <br/>For a new setting (my new campaign I'm prepping for is Iron Kingdoms setting)  if most of the players are NEW to the setting,  what would you suggest go into a "primer" for the setting?<br/><br/>History of the city?  or larger (the world)?<br/>A timeline?  How extensive?<br/>VIP of the setting's Non-player characters (like "this is the emperor"...)<br/>What rules from the game would you include?<br/>Notes on character creation?<br/>Prints from the rules?  (like the character creation section)?<br/><br/>How much or what is too much?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>So... do you GIVE or have you RECIEVED things like this for new campaigns?<br/>If so, what did you think?<br/>If not,  would you have liked one?  <br/><br/>Or...  Is it just wasted work?<br/><br/><br/><br/>I'd love to hear your experiences or ideas...<br/>thanks<br/>-kev-                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184538/#Comment_184538" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-21T14:24:50+00:00" title="December 21, 2008  2:24PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I do a briefing packet of things for the players.  Most of that is now being placed online for them, with PDF printing being so easy now.<br/><br/>I did have a GM that had these PC packets that had all of our character info etc that we turned back in at the end of the session for him to keep.  This was to prevent certain players from forgetting to bring their sheet to play.  He also put in all sorts of a cool cheat-sheets and such, but since you couldn't take them home, they tended to be quick capsule things for use in-play.<br/><br/>It is a neat way of sharing your organizational talents with the group (especially if you have a disorganized or forgetful player who never seems to bring his or her stuff twice in a row...), but it can sometimes be seen as a bit domineering.  <br/><br/>For example, one GM I played with long ago did this with PC Sheets to "Prevent changes to them between games".  Needless to say, we were a bit insulted that he thought we would cheat.  He would compare the values of the sheet with his computations and adjust them if need be.  This guy also railroaded like Thomas the Tank-Engine.  Sucky Play resulted, courtesy of the "only game in town" effect.  We ended up getting enough players to drop him from the group and get back to playing fun again (well, as fun as you can play when the game of choice in your circle is "Rolemaster" - yikes!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184609/#Comment_184609" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-22T11:01:04+00:00" title="December 22, 2008 11:01AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a <a href="http://transit.legendary.org/index.php/Image:Transit_Player%27s_Guide.pdf" rel="nofollow">Player's Guide</a> I set up for my D&amp;D 4E campaign.

My friends that USED TO do that, after a year or more of gaming slacked off to do little/none of that.  Which stinks. <br/>Familiarity breeds complacency...<br/><br/><br/>For the online resources - while I DO hope players use them, I'd also say they're just as important as a campaign bible to me.  For some reason, when it's online for people to view I tend to be more diligent about getting it updated with recent game info.  And when I'm thinking or prepping for the games it's super simple to reference.  Same said when playing.  A wiki resource is super quick to find that bit of info or an NPC name that normally takes 2-3 minutes to dig through my pile of notes.<br/><br/>-kev-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184732/#Comment_184732" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-23T15:37:11+00:00" title="December 23, 2008  3:37PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: kevperrine</cite>Familiarity breeds complacency...</blockquote>\nOr contempt.  I agree that older groups tend to do such norming away from proactivity and participation.  I think that it is because this sort of effort flies in teh face of their assumptions that the group now has a shorthand and way of doing things that requires no additional input.<br/><br/>The question is, is there something in play or in the group forming process that creates this?

All associated rulebooks were on hand to provide full descriptions, but the packages allowed multiple players to read about the same core bits all at once. It really sped up the start. The players, who were used to a gamemaster who tried to use their unfamiliarity with a game against them, expressed their appreciation, too.<br/><br/>I have been on the receiving end of a smaller package created for a homemade setting. I did enjoy receiving it and being able to keep it for reference at the start of each session. After all, it can be a couple of weeks between games, and I won't necessarily remember everything about the game world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
