If you say "OK, you're the elf, you're the dwarf, you're the taciturn ranger, there's a hole in the ground full of goblins, go" people will approach the task without any cognitive dissonance, with a shared vision of what's going on, and with gusto.  Sit me down with guys from Norway, Japan and Delaware and we can rock that pretty well.  We can all work as a team to kill some goblins.  <br/><br/>Personally I think the vanilla fantasy setup is simultaneously tedious and fraught with ideological peril, so I'm not down with it as a default.  I want something more human but still big and colorful and a little simple, whose tropes are instantly recognizable from other media.  I also don't want to fall back on a licensed property, which would be nice but is a non-starter.<br/><br/>For Americans, the wild west is pretty much perfect, but I don't think it scales globally too well.  Correct me if I'm wrong, Japanese and Norwegians.  If I said "OK, you're the gunslinger, you're the drunk sheriff and you're the schoolmarm, there's a hole in the ground full of outlaws, go" would there be conflicting visions?  Dissonance?  The same jump-right-in you'd get with elves?<br/><br/>Original science fiction or unique fantasy, for reasons of shared vision, seems right out.  I don't want to spend time explaining <i>anything.</i><br/><br/>Maybe the action/disaster movie would work.  You have to find the Queen and disable the nuclear launch codes, despite the fact that the cruise ship has capsized on top of you and the world is upside-down!<br/><br/>What about post-apocalyptic?  Is that something everybody implicitly gets?  Lunatics with garbage can shields riding around in tricked-out tricycles scavenging cans of tomato soup?<br/><br/>I'm open to ideas.

With almost all genres this comes down to whether people have seen and become fans of the given genre of American television, though: it's from American television that the genres of police procedural, medical drama, western and most other television genres are learned. So there's no special pride of place among these various genres, it's just a question of whether the given person watches television a lot or not - if they do, they probably watch the same shows you do, albeit possibly at a couple of years remove.<br/><br/>Looking for things that gamers specifically would get, my own pick at this point has to be zombies. I've yet to demonstrate Zombie Cinema to <i>anybody</i> who didn't know what the genre is about, and that sample must be several hundred gamers and dozens of non-gamers by now. Heck, even my mother gets what the genre is about - I don't know if it's osmosis or what, I don't think she's seen a zombie movie since they originally became a fad in her youth. There's something conceptually simple about people trying to escape from rotting cannibals, apparently.<br/><br/>(If you want mainstream, then zombies can be replaced with a generalized catastrophe. Whatever you think would be familiar as a milieu - Titanic sinking would probably be familiar to many in the fairer sex insofar as a catastrophe milieu goes, I imagine.)<br/><br/>Action movie is a good context if you want to be slightly more mainstream. That, or more specifically spies. The thriller as a genre has the big advantage of having a large movie canon as well as a literary canon to fall back on, both within and outside mainstream, so it's practically unfeasible to find anybody who doesn't have some inkling of it. In fact, I wouldn't even call action a genre so much as the breathing component of American drama theory.<br/><br/>If you want an action genre that is intricate yet familiar to gamers, superheroes are a no-brainer. Perhaps shojo adventure drama gets to the same level in ten years, but at this moment the only competitor for superheroes is fantasy, really.<br/><br/>A good question, however, is whether a given genre is approachable because it's familiar or because it is simple. One could argue that bog-standard fantasy has plenty of intricacies that can't be grasped without prior knowledge, so perhaps it's not the simplicity that makes it work here, but rather its popularity. The zombies, though, they are simple: is it that everybody has seen a zombie movie, or is that you don't actually need to have seen anything like it to grasp what the genre is about?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_203402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy" title="DeBracy"><img alt="DeBracy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nTIWP6SSS5BV3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy">DeBracy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203402/#Comment_203402" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-24T07:21:00+00:00" title="April 24, 2009  7:21AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What about some kind of expedition?

Yojimbo was remade as A Fistful of Dollars (and later as Last Man Standing). The Seven Samurai was remade as The Magnificent Seven.<br/><br/>And it should be noted that western themes also made their way into Japanese movies. Throne of Blood is a Japanese remake of MacBeth. Ran is a Japanese remake of King Lear. <br/><br/>Obviously the 'genres' are different in all these examples.

(That would be the gangster, but against we have exploitation, crime, racism, and if not genocide, a dangerous levels of misogyny) <br/><br/>not to wave the 'PC run amuk' flag, which is generally a excuse to stick your head in the ground and attempt to ignore these issues, but have you considered that part of the reason why 'generic fantasy' is popular is because its the least stinky of the pile? <br/><br/>Some other ideas,<br/><br/>Spies / Super Spies are coming out pretty rosy in this genre debate surprisingly sure you have all that same exploitation colonialism and sexism but its tastefully hide behind boobs and gadgets. <br/><br/>Nazi's are perhaps the only unmentioned idea that will immediately be understood against disparate groups but hey i think they are already out of your scope.<br/><br/>As for post apocolyptic, ignoring monster apocolypse (Zed Day) I still think their is a huge difference between MAD MAX and say The Postman.

Doesn't have to be racist/imperialist.<br/><br/>Rebellion is another good one; not sure it's been mentioned.  Les Mis, Star Wars, Spartacus, FF VII, Robin Hood... all stories of with rebel hideouts against the evil empire.<br/><br/>Space marines and space alien attack; that's pretty easy.  Doesn't have to have a really specific setting.  You're in space.  Aliens attack.<br/><br/>Starcrossed lovers can work if you're into less (physical) conflict and us vs the Other mentality.  Everyone undestands the roles: the lovers, the parents, the friends of the lovers, the "right guy/girl".<br/><br/>Again, with the less killing, there's other genres to explore; you can have a race (horse, car, ships, whatever) and that's easy to fall into.  I kind of like that one, actually, since it gives a really simple goal and doesn't rely on lethal combat with a designated enemy class to generate conflict.

Like many commenters have pointed out, the details of post-apocalyptic, or police procedural are going to vary slightly or significantly, place to place. Every time I read an RPG book that involves "real world"-inspired crime stories or politics, I have to filter that through my "well, ok, but that's not how we do it here" matrix, because even in Canada our politics and law enforcement are significantly different from our southern neighbours.<br/><br/><br/>That said, it might be better to style something around -themes- rather than -genres-. If you say "this is a game about Pirates", people in Asia or Africa might have a different reaction than Americans. If you say "this is a game about Epics", then anyone with a passing familiarity with their culture/country's historical literature/mythology will know what you mean. China has great epics, India has great epics, many European nations have their own unique epics, etc. And then you can work out the common ground of the setting/genre with the group.<br/><br/>So, "this is my game about personal tragedy" is something most people can understand (if not get behind), and then through discussion you can flesh out the setting (it takes place in a hospital, in a generic European country, the PCs are staff members, etc).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_203455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203455/#Comment_203455" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-24T11:54:22+00:00" title="April 24, 2009 11:54AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 24, 2009 11:54AM by ccreitz.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Soap operas.

Ghost stories really are universal, I think: kids tell them to each other, after all.  If I had to put my finger on the one genre that everyone in the world who was not raised by wolves would immediately grasp, I'd go with ghost stories in a heartbeat.<br/><br/><br/>In contrast, generic fantasy is meaningless to a lot of the people I hang out with, and I would never, ever use it as a baseline game genre.  Everybody doesn't understand it, and you can't really count on anyone having read, heard, or watched something close enough to it.<br/><br/>Now, everyone who's already into gaming is probably familiar with vanilla fantasy, if only through D&amp;D (either having played themselves or from comments about it made by other gamers)...but as a universally understood genre, it fails.  The Lord of the Rings movies helped spread it around a little more, but it's still a "WTF?"-generating mystery to plenty of people.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thor Olavsrud</cite>Yojimbo was remade as A Fistful of Dollars (and later as Last Man Standing).</blockquote>\nAnd Yojimbo is itself a reworking of Dashiell Hammett's classic detective novel <i>Red Harvest</i>!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_203468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203468/#Comment_203468" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-24T13:22:50+00:00" title="April 24, 2009  1:22PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps not perfectly universal, but with a little adaptation a school drama can be found in pretty much any culture (with a formal education system).

Given that, and without proper disclosure, your players are just going to have to either play in familiar settings, or do their homework.  Both of those drop the game from the goal of the discussion, which is no-prep settings that people plug into instantly without briefing or, I gather, cultural misapprehension.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_203578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203578/#Comment_203578" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-26T00:48:45+00:00" title="April 26, 2009 12:48AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JuddG</cite>That way, they can make a character who can plug into the premise, but the player doesn't have to read a bunch of intel on the cool game world setting of some fantasy setting or whatnot ahead of time.</blockquote>\n...but if everyone knows the genre well enough to be able to plug into the premise (it's a universal genre in the group), why do you need to sneak the genre in after the game has already started?  i.e., if they know enough about fantasy settings to make a character who will work nicely in your fantasy game, why bother with starting in the modern era and transporting the characters to the "real" game?
