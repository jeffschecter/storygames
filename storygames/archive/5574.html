He didn't have a system to run it in or any notes or anything.  None of us know anything about cricket.  So here's the system we used:<br/><br/><i>Assign your character skills and abilities and whatever from 1-5.  In conflict set some stakes and roll 1d6.  A 1 is a spectacular success, a 6 is a spectacular failure.  Anything else equal to or less than your skill or ability or whatever is a success. </i> <br/><br/>Now as systems go, that's a profoundly stupid one (it has a bit of history with my group, actually).  Naturally, we had a really fun game.  We were using gamer tricks like building a tight relationship map - Captain Ranga is in debt?  He's in debt <i>to my uncle Tariq!</i>  Rajesh is an inveterate cheater?  He's my best friend, I don't know about it, and<i> I hate cheaters!</i>  So the game was very cool - we had a nail-biting cricket test match against our arch-rivals, we had a dance-off in a disco, there were thugs and bribery and bodylining (thanks, Wikipedia).  My guy's sister got married!  There was even a fun religious sub-plot (our Captain was Bengali Hindu and the rest of us were Muslim).  In the end we had a genuinely touching moment when my naive power hitter realized that he'd only made the national team through the bribery and subterfuge of the people he thought were his best friends, and walked away from cricket forever.<br/><br/>The dice helped, and the fact that something crazy happened 33% of the time was reliably fun.  But it was essentially a throw-away system and a one-shot game, and it was the players who made it really, really good.  This probably isn't noteworthy, but as a guy who builds games where the system tends to matter a lot, playing one where it didn't was entertaining and instructive.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_124961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124961/#Comment_124961" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-07T11:28:01+00:00" title="February  7, 2008 11:28AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think your post was actually very instructive.  Most people looking to play a game are reading the rules to try and learn how to play it.  But as has been hashed out on S-G before, often the printed rules don't include all of the things that the designers/playtesters are actually doing to make the game fun for *them*.<br/><br/>"Oh, tight relationship map.  Push for the big finish in a one-shot  Those are no brainers." (I'm not quoting anyone in particular here)<br/><br/>One of the things that made Dogs such an mind-altering read for me was that Vincent wasn't just teaching you the rules, he was teaching you <i>how he intended the game to be played</i>.  No guesswork, that sh*t was all there in the book.<br/><br/>Jason, I think you do a really good job with content in your games and I think there's some secret sauce there.  Not just reading/playing your games, but in listening to the AP on your podcast.  You seem to come up with great names on the fly and have some really evocative source material to work with.  I think the Oracles are a step in the right direction, but I wonder how that can best be included in games as a whole.  Is it example play throughout the book?  Lots of source content inside of the rules ala Hot War?  Charts or tables of content as an appendix?  A little of each?  It's easy for players to boink at the table, either because they can't come up with the right fiction or because it feels forces apon them.<br/><br/>Example: I was playing through chargen with a playtest copy of Duty &amp; Honour last night with a friend.  He and I were pretty excited about the mix of role-playing a military campaigning, and it felt almost like an extension to a set of miniatures rules (in a good way).  But he and I know very little about the Napoleonic Era, and so the chargen felt flat and a little too mechanical.  If these characters were from a different era, say dumped on an Anzio beachhead in WW2, I would have been so on it because I know that history.  But I found myself just saying, "Uh, ok, I got two more points of engineering.  Okay, what's next?"  This is not a dig on D&amp;H as the rules are still early and I had a sinus headache.  But the point was that I was looking to be inspired and was not.<br/><br/>Matching the color to the mechanics and empowering the players while making the process feel natural seems to be the gold for me.<br/><br/>Thoughts?  Am I drifting this in a direction you didn't intent?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_124970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124970/#Comment_124970" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-07T11:44:41+00:00" title="February  7, 2008 11:44AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Chris, that's something I've thought a lot about, given my weird historical obsession.  You're 100% right about Dogs - Vincent lays out the procedures for play but also the <i>system </i>(in the broadest sense) in a way that is very agreeable.  I've never succeeded in emulating that because it is extraordinarily difficult.  With The Roach I didn't even try, and that was a conscious decision.<br/><br/>In last night's game we all borrowed lamely from <i>Lagaan</i>, from north Indian and Arabic lists of names, and from Wikipedia.  The whole thing had a very Bollywood vibe.  I think it caught fire because of the R-map stuff in that case, which is universal.<br/><br/>About history - <i>Grey Ranks </i>needed to provide a ton of background on the fly, and I needed it to be evocative and reasonably accurate.  So you get situation elements, which I totally stole from Vincent, combined with radio transcripts at the start of each unit of play.  I backstopped those required elements with a ton of optional information that rarely gets used at the table but often informs play one way or another.  That's one approach.  I'm sure there are lots, and more elegant ways of approaching it, too.  I have not seen Duty and Honour so I can't comment on it, although I'd love to see it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125130/#Comment_125130" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-08T08:18:10+00:00" title="February  8, 2008  8:18AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I enjoyed our crazy system, with the all-or-nothing drama of using a single six-sider to determine how the conflicts went.

Cricket - sorry, but you had me at 'roleplaying' and 'cricket'. If you want some Shaolin Cricket you should watch some 20-20 games on .. oh probably EPSN12 or whatever. Really quick games (for cricket, thats three hours), fireworks, massive slogs and best of all cheerleaders and dancers.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. D&amp;H; - yep, I can see that. In fact, I have as <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> in my 'Big List o'Playtest Feedback' - 'Needs More Flavour'. Cheers for the feedback, Chris. Its actually something that I have had mentioned directly before. My friends are not as interested in the Peninsular War as I am but one of them is very into his WH40K. He looked at D&amp;H; and said - 'You know, with a small hack here and there, I could do space marines with this!' And he could. Similarly we have discussed ways that it could pretty easily be drifted into WW2, Roman Legionnaires and Honor Harrington-esque space navy stuff too.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Jason wants to see D&amp;H;?
