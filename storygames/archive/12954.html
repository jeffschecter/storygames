I thought the system was simple and enjoyable. We ran into a couple tricky bits, but I think that was a matter of system understanding and confidence.<br/><br/>I GM'ed for Carly as she played Gideon, a scholar, who went to the place where the clockwork war raged on still. It was a massive clockwork city, empty of all life. Clockwork people went about their days, clicking around and picking up metal groceries and sitting on metal couches reading metal newspapers. The game ended up way more steampunky than I'd thought when Carly drew a picture of Gideon and he was wearing a suit and a bowtie. Gideon met a crazy, lonely girl in the Clockwork City while he tried to unravel its mysteries, and then a metal creature with sharp blades for hands and telescoping legs pursued them through the city. It ended up killing the girl and Gideon shortly after.<br/><br/>Then it was my turn. I played Lukuls who was a skull-wearing savage who journeyed to the Lunar Citadel with his tribesmen to gain the blessing of the moon goddess as they made war on the Ursu tribe, who worshipped her enemies, the the Three Bears (haha that was accidental and not hilarious in the game). As he journeyed to the top of the Lunar Citadel, he heard his men shouting. He rushed to leave the temple but the priestesses would not let him out. He forced his way out and his men were gone, so he attackd the priestesses. At that moment the moon goddess revealed herself. Lukuls decided if she would not give him her blessing, he would take it. In a lucky shot he struck the helmet from her head and ran away with it. As she approached he smeared the helmet with his blood and whispered words of prayer to his snake god, Lyriss, and the moon goddess became trapped in the helmet.<br/><br/>I think in the second adventure, the monster was Lukuls. <img alt=":/" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/confused.png" title=":/"/> <br/><br/>We hope to play again soon.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_291964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/boulet" title="boulet"><img alt="boulet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/534/nTWF4B3HT5CT6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/boulet">boulet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291964/#Comment_291964" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-07T10:20:06+00:00" title="September  7, 2010 10:20AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wish you would share your interrogations about the "tricky bits"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_291982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291982/#Comment_291982" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-07T10:49:17+00:00" title="September  7, 2010 10:49AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for sharing this, Bret.  I have been curious to read a game set in the Clockwork City and wonder at its fictional inspiration relative to some of the other starting settings.<br/><br/>Was the crazy girl intended to be a possible lover for Gideon?  I'd think things might feel a bit tricky starting right there...<br/><br/>I am curious about your definition of "ladyfriend" in the context of playing this game.  That might have some interesting implications for how the story might tend to go, especially for the first time playing.  None of my business, of course, if you don't care to comment further on this aside.<br/><br/>I've been wondering at what it might be like to play this game with an opposite gendered person who was not my romantic partner and also with one who was (the latter is probably not a possibility - she might consent to play Breaking the Ice with me someday but is almost certainly not interested in S/Lay).  I've had a lot of female friends with whom I could play this game comfortably but I'm not in touch anymore with the few that played role-playing games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_291992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291992/#Comment_291992" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-07T11:07:12+00:00" title="September  7, 2010 11:07AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 7, 2010 11:17AM by jdfristrom.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the second one who was the Monster and who was the Lover?

One of my Goes sort of threw off Carly's plans and I think it took her awhile to recover. She's never GMed before so I think it'll just be a matter of practice.<br/><br/>nemomeme, the crazy girl actually was his lover. I gave a quick summary so as not to bore anyone, but she ended up seducing Gideon. They were eating breakfast in a metal house when the machine attacked and they fled together. There wasn't anything particularly tricky about their interactions so I'm curious what you mean. And ladyfriend means she's my girlfriend. We have been known to kiss on occasion.<br/><br/>jd, the Lover was one of the priestesses of the moon goddess. The monster was the moon goddess, though Carly intended there to be a different monster though I never found out what. My goal was to get the moon goddess's blessing. I think the interactions of those three things caused some of the trickiness.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292007/#Comment_292007" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-07T11:31:34+00:00" title="September  7, 2010 11:31AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Damn you all and your S/w/m APs.

It was interesting to see our shared imaginings of it bumping into one another. I was describing this crazy clockwork battle in a city where all sorts of mechanical people run along tracks, and she's like, "So, Gideon gets off the train..." and I was like, "Trains stop here? And we're playing in a world with <i>trains?</i>" It was cool though. She keeps shifting the game towards steampunk where I'm like rawr sword and sorcery.<br/><br/>We played again last night and Mirabelle went to the city built on a cemetary. It was a city built by a clan of sorcerers who'd fled their enemies and enacted rites of protection to keep themselves safe on the old necropolis of an ancient empire. Any who wished to live there under the protection of the sorcerers could do so, but they swore an oath that when they died they would pass into the service of the sorcerers until their bodies fell apart.<br/><br/>Mirabelle, a woman with a bandaged arm and a bandaged eye, was there seeking Foust, an old student of her master's. She wanted revenge on her master and believed he could help her. When she arrived she met Anala, a young woman with long white hair who volunteered to act as her guide. She showed her some of the sights of the city, including the puppet show at the One-Eyed Vulture inn.<br/><br/>That night Mirabelle awoke in her room in the inn and felt cold and pain clutching at her chest. She looked out the window and saw it rimmed with frost and a shrouded creature with glowing red eyes was looking in. She whispered a protective spell and it disappeared.<br/><br/>The next day, on their way to see Foust, Anala fainted, her skin blue. The creature appeared again and gestured towards Mirabelle and her veins turned black. She felt cold and fatigue overtaking her. She fled with Anala, seeking to find Foust and made her way to some of the vulture statues in the city that protect the living against the angry dead. The creature followed and the guardian vulture tried to stop it but was shattered by a wave of the creature's hand. Mirabelle undid her bandages, though, revealing a clockwork eye and an arm of brass. She held her hand out and an aperture opened and she sucked the creature into it.<br/><br/>Foust had been watching the whole time, but had been unsure if Mirabelle had been sent by his old master to kill him. When she revealed she was here to study under him, he gave her a flask to drink from that ridded her and Anala of whatever affliction the creature had given them. He opened a door in a rock nearby and Mirabelle followed him into it.<br/><br/>Another good story! One thing I've noticed, which sounds like it might be different than how some others play, is that we don't play hard for the dice. We often make many, many moves where no monster or goal/lover dice are in play. The scene in the inn, or Anala's initial conversation with Mirabelle about the city. It could be we're not including forward-moving actions in our Goes, but it seems like we are. It seems to be working out well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/boulet" title="boulet"><img alt="boulet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/534/nTWF4B3HT5CT6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/boulet">boulet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292168/#Comment_292168" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-08T06:25:07+00:00" title="September  8, 2010  6:25AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bret Gillan</cite>Another good story!

But Carly did something interesting and kind of cool in our first session by having the monster go after things I cared about that were unrelated to the goal. I had brought some tribesmen with me and she had the monster go after them. So then I had to choose between dice or pursuing the monster. It was rough. Luckily I'd stockpiled enough dice that I could afford to go after them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294871/#Comment_294871" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-28T05:07:05+00:00" title="September 28, 2010  5:07AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since the last time we played, Lukuls has assassinated the leader of the Ursu tribe, banished their giant bear god to the stars, and still NOT gotten laid. Carly is making it her mission to get Lukuls to accept a lover. The last one was close, and man he would have stayed, but she helped him plot against her father (who was the leader of the Ursu tribe) so he didn't trust her.<br/><br/>Mirabelle went to the Crystal Court with Anala and met the King of the Crystal Court. It was this giant crystal castle with people trapped inside the walls, and he told her that the Queen had cast a spell to protect her people, keeping them inside the walls. Oh, and the King was wrapped in a layer of crystal and had crystal eyeballs. Him and Mirabelle totally did it but he turned out to be evil! The Queen's spell was to protect her people but he'd used his own sorcery to pervert it and was gaining power fuelled by their misery. Mirabelle used her magical gauntlet arm to drive him away and was able to rescue Anala and the Queen and escape, but he shot a bunch of crystals at her that slivered her all over and stuck in her, so she's badly injured and has a crystal embedded deep inside her that causes pain.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
