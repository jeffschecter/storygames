After studying the blueprints of the house, he comes up with a Clever Plan.<br/><br/>I love Clever Plans.  They are awesome in books and TV shows and movies, but it seems they are somewhat troublesome in a Traditional Roleplaying Game.  If I'm the GM in a Traditional Game, it feels as though there is the assumption that I will make extensive plans and notes about the world and relevant NPCs.  If I suspect the PCs are going to try to break into some building and they try to come up with a Clever Plan, I'm supposed to know whether said Clever Plan would be feasible.  The problem is, I'm not that clever, and if I didn't think of that same Clever Plan beforehand on my own, I'll probably have created a situation in which the Plan wouldn't work, and so the player would probably never even mention it, because they would realize it was impossible.<br/><br/>Some games include rules or system to allow players aside from the GM ways to alter or create elements of the game world beyond their own character.  But most Traditional Games do not.<br/><br/>What are some ways to increase the potential for Player Authorship in Traditional Roleplaying Games without actually altering rules or systems (at least to any major extent?<br/><br/>I can think a few ideas off the top of my head.<br/>One is purely social.  I could attempt to encourage my players to chime in with things like: "I know you said the street is empty, but it would be really cool if there was a car parked nearby because I was thinking of trying to do..." and if everyone agrees that it is, indeed, really cool, we could change things.  I'm not sure I'd like this idea too much though, and I'm not sure my friends would either.  Constantly revising statements after they've been made seems like it would get awkward.<br/><br/>A similar but different thing would be to try using the "Mounting Witch Trick" more.  The whole, "When you answer the phone you are shocked to hear a voice that you recognize... who is it?" but when I've tried that in the past, my friends have balked at the idea that they, mere players, would be asked to make decisions about the game world (this is something that, I suppose, they may get more comfortable with over time).<br/><br/>The third idea is basically allowing players to describe the effects of their own successful dice rolls.  Thus instead of, "Well, you succeeded with your research roll and found blueprints of the house: here's what you find out..." I could do, "If you succeed with your research roll you'll discover a security flaw in the building's blueprints.  Yay!  You succeeded!  Tell me about the flaw you found."<br/><br/>What other useful methods am I missing?<br/>(please also feel free to correct any mistaken assumptions or bad ideas I may have above)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212358/#Comment_212358" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-15T11:12:45+00:00" title="June 15, 2009 11:12AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the social idea.

I think I first read this in <i>Feng Shui</i>, where they explicitly said that if someone asks if a particular object is in a location and it makes some sense for that object to be there, then it IS there.  So in this case, you'd say that the street was empty, then later a player would ask "is there a car parked nearby?" and lo and behold, a parked car would in fact be there, because that fits on an empty street.  Same for a streetlight, a wooden fence, a pair of shoes hanging from a telephone wire, or a manhole.  (A marching band, on the other hand, would not fit, and you'd have to say no to that.)<br/><br/>For in-character planning, it's kind of the same deal: don't define everything in advance, or be flexible with those definitions, and then let the natural questioning of the players steer you from there.  Maybe answer some questions with questions, trying to suss out their reasoning and thereby keep your answers from shutting down clever ideas prematurely.  And also maybe start with the premise that any semi-reasonable plan could work -- just frame the problem in a general way, and when the players start leaning towards a plausible-sounding clever plan, place the holes and gaps appropriately so that it IS the most clever plan for the situation.  Maybe have a couple of ideas already in your head in case the players stall out -- things that they could find out that would make the obstacles in front of them look less impenetrable -- as hints you can drop to get them moving again.<br/><br/>I mean, if your goal is some degree of player authorship, then you really have to be willing to let them do it, and you can't do that without leaving blank space for them to work in.  You don't have to explicitly point out the blank space (and there are good reasons why you shouldn't!), you just have to be willing to shift things around to let the ideas they're coming up with be relevant and useful.<br/><br/><br/>As a player in trad games, I tend to use back-channels for things -- I suggest stuff when we're not playing, or send e-mail, or bluebook, or what have you, and author/promote the things I want to see more of.  It gives me time to really think about what I'm saying and give it the best possible presentation, which seems to help make GMs want to run with it.  It also doesn't interrupt the flow of the actual game for me.  When I GM, I encourage players to do the same, and try to structure my plans (such as they are) to key off of both what the players are doing in the actual game session and any out-of-game stuff they bring up to me.  I try to use a lot of answering-questions-with-questions and "any plan that could work is fine with me"-style design work to give the players' ideas and initiative their due.<br/><br/><br/>I tried the "Mountain Witch trick" a few times, but I don't really like it on either side of the table.  It just feels <i>off</i> to me to deliberately point out that something significant is being invented on the spot, it seems really obviously artificial and unsatisfying.  I don't like how it wrecks the pacing of the game when it's dropped on a player who isn't prepared for it (sometimes you've got nothing, or at least nothing for that particular question, and the minutes spent looking for inspiration can be deadly).  And it's so easy to ask bad questions, things that the player does not give a crap about and therefore has no reason to feel invested in even when he's the one answering it.  I'm sure that to some extent those are entirely my own hangups and not something inherently wrong with the technique, but the bottom line is the same for me...I hardly ever use it these days, and don't miss it at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_212397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maedhros" title="Maedhros"><img alt="Maedhros" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maedhros">Maedhros</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212397/#Comment_212397" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-15T13:30:07+00:00" title="June 15, 2009  1:30PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't forget that in film and literature, The Clever Plan almost always leads to The Unforeseen Complication, requiring the protagonist to improvise a Solution On The Fly.<br/><br/>So, I'd say the onus on the GM is to come up with interesting Unforeseen Complications...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212415">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212415/#Comment_212415" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-15T14:26:53+00:00" title="June 15, 2009  2:26PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My approach to this is to steal my players' brains!<br/><br/>My prep for most games is to figure out One Big Problem and then some ways the PCs can encounter it, but without really knowing what is causing the big problem or how it relates to anything.

Player 2: Oh, yeah, I bet it does! They did the same thing in their lair. Me (sotto voce): Spider cult? I ran a spider cult? Hunh... ok, well, they are DEFINITELY involved then). Once they have made a few really great connections, then I make the best ones into Truth (with some room for surprises) and kick the Improv Drive back into high gear.<br/><br/>The best villains are always a few steps ahead of our heroes, and since you can't be expected to stay ahead of all of your players all the time, then just make them think you are!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_212416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212416/#Comment_212416" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-15T14:28:06+00:00" title="June 15, 2009  2:28PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite>What are some ways to increase the potential for Player Authorship in Traditional Roleplaying Games without actually altering rules or systems (at least to any major extent?</blockquote>\nHave a look at <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6054" rel="nofollow">this thread.</a><br/><br/>Perhaps do it like Mouse Guard and widen the scope of task resolution and the meaningfulness of individual rolls so that you're not rolling on each tiny little Clever Plan subtask.  The leading PC rolls once, perhaps with helping rolls / bonuses from other PCs -- or perhaps everyone gets exactly one roll in their area of expertise.<br/><br/>Choose challenges for them that don't exactly correspond to their character abilities. Before the rolling, have the players describe what skills they're using and how.   This is the Clever Plan generation phase.    They're going to want to use their most effective powers, of course.  If their effective abilities are ones that aren't obviously applicable, challenge them on those choices, and make them justify them.  Reward lateral thinking.<br/><br/>You could go the D&amp;D4 skill challenge route here and prepare notes pregame for likely skill usage, difficulty factors, complications, and failure fallout so that you have something to fall back on if your players go dry.  Be willing to throw these away, of course.  <br/><br/>Perhaps give die roll bonuses for player authorship; perhaps give big bonuses when a player references another piece of player authorship.Say yes a bunch during this phase and also give the players enough information to springboard their imaginations.  Like for an intrusion caper, provide some casual details about the building, its architecture, height, externally-visible security, etc.  <br/><br/>(I've made this mistake, launching 4E skill challenges with no seed information, and it went splat.)<br/><br/>After the roll: like you mentioned before...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite>The third idea is basically allowing players to describe the effects of their own successful dice rolls.</blockquote>\nOr maybe get the leader to describe their failure.  Savvy players might grasp at ways to bend the fiction so that the effects of their failure are mitigated.  Everyone wins in that scenario.<br/><br/>Another thought about post-die-roll narration: how about starting by introducing player success narration for killshots or critical hits?  Those are 'special' times of player empowerment and might be a little easier for your traditional group to rise to, and will break the ice on the whole pervy player authorship thing.  Later on you can take them fully to the dark side and have them describe their failures.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212481/#Comment_212481" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-15T17:17:18+00:00" title="June 15, 2009  5:17PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 15, 2009 5:18PM by Valvorik.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I freeform D&amp;D skill challenges noting that players are free to author things fitting with the general scope of challenge scenario when they say how they are contributing to success (emphasizing action narration preceeds mechanical skill choice etc.).  This has lead to them describing the ice in frozen river breaking and someone falling in (needing rescue), there being children discovered as captives who were sickly unto death's door but a source of information if cured (alas, didn't roll well on that particular check), etc.<br/><br/>This leads to mixed results, in that there is a bit of creativity and a bit of "not sure what to do" but I think the creativity is growing.  My last one was to "freeform the dungeon" as a skill challenge, starting off with its general description (dwarven ruin, think Moria) and their mission (find some dwarven soldiers who went exploring) and then it was for them to describe what happened.  Different failure and success totals would reveal more about dungeon or lead into various encounters etc., with failure overall = very bad initial start to encounter with the Big Bad; success overall = very good start to same.<br/><br/>I think the key in the dungeon challenge working well was to be "no pressure" on creativity, inviting them to invent the most Gygaxian events they wanted to or the most dramatic etc., it could all be about how they were clever with a sack of flour and 10' pole if they wanted.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_212574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212574/#Comment_212574" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-16T07:30:06+00:00" title="June 16, 2009  7:30AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Plug in Aspects, Keys, Passions, Beliefs (a declaration of character story interest with minor mechanical application).<br/><br/>Let the players' guesses sometimes be right regardless of your story secrets.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212627/#Comment_212627" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-16T10:13:15+00:00" title="June 16, 2009 10:13AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "If I'm the GM in a Traditional Game, it feels as though there is the assumption that I will make extensive plans and notes about the world and relevant NPCs."<br/><br/>I think though that's more an issue about your assumptions than it is traditional GMing.  There's nothing in traditional games that requires that sort of input, I've heard of those who do it but I think they were always a bit of a minority.<br/><br/>So, how do you do this?  Well, you can empower the players, but it's probably no longer a traditional rpg at that point, and for some players being given authorial rights actually actively hinders their fun (me for example), what most traditional GMs do is simply to extrapolate from what they do know about the situation whether the plan is likely to work or not, if the plan exploits something wholly undetailed consider whether it seems reasonable or not and then go from there.<br/><br/>I'm not knocking the solutions, they're good solutions, but to the wrong problem.  If your problem is you want more shared authorship and the games aren't delivering that, fair enough.  But the actually stated problem isn't a problem of any particular game, it's a problem about a false assumption of what is involved in GMing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_212861">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212861/#Comment_212861" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-17T07:56:44+00:00" title="June 17, 2009  7:56AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 17, 2009 7:57AM by fnord3125.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the input and feedback, everyone!<br/>A couple points:<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite>Those are 'special' times of player empowerment and might be a little easier for your traditional group to rise to, and will break the ice on the whole pervy player authorship thing.</blockquote>For me and my friends in particular, this isn't really an issue.  We've played the dirty hippy games.  I wouldn't say we're a "traditional group."  But I think there are certain assumptions both me and my friends make when we play <i>traditional games</i>.  They expect to be coming up with information about the world if we play Dirty Secrets or Polaris, they don't when if we're (as in this case) playing nWoD.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Balbinus</cite>"If I'm the GM in a Traditional Game, it feels as though there is the assumption that I will make extensive plans and notes about the world and relevant NPCs."<br/><br/>I think though that's more an issue about your assumptions than it is traditional GMing.  There's nothing in traditional games that requires that sort of input, I've heard of those who do it but I think they were always a bit of a minority.<br/><br/>So, how do you do this?  Well, you can empower the players, but it's probably no longer a traditional rpg at that point, and for some players being given authorial rights actually actively hinders their fun (me for example), what most traditional GMs do is simply to extrapolate from what they do know about the situation whether the plan is likely to work or not, if the plan exploits something wholly undetailed consider whether it seems reasonable or not and then go from there.</blockquote>Mmmmm... yes and no, about the assumptions, bit.  I might have phrased it poorly.  I don't actually come up with extensive notes, and my friends know that.  What I really meant was they they expect, for the most part, to be getting all information about the world from me.  If I say something is there, it's there, if I say something isn't there, it isn't.  They'll occasionally protest if they feel something seems extremely unrealistic, but otherwise, well, I'm the dude who says what's in the world, and that's how it goes in a traditional game.  And I think this can be problematic sometimes, at least if the aim is to create cool stories together.<br/><br/>Let me go back to the example from Lost Room that got me thinking about this, but I'll go into actual detail for those who have no idea what I'm talking about.  A guy acquires a magic key that, if used in any swinging door with a mechanical lock, opens into the same room.  Then, when leaving that room, he can exit from any door that fits the above description.  He wants to break into this other guy's house.  That guy is both very rich and knows about this key.  So he rebuilt his house at one point so that every door in it is a sliding door and uses electronic locks with keypads and keycards.  However, Key-Guy has been in there one before and knows theres a fancy-schmancy fake castle for the other guy's kid's birthday that has a door that probably will work, so hey!  he can get in that way.  then, he studies the plans for the house and realizes that one of the normal doors that used to be in there might have just been walled over rather than removes, so he figures he can get out that way.<br/><br/>Look at this situation as if it were happening in an RPG.  In my experience (which, granted, is not exhaustive) if a player had that key and was trying to break into someone's house, he'd go "This'll be easy!" then some NPC would say, "Oh, not so fast, you can't do that, cuz blah blah blah."  So the PC might do some research.  The player might think to himself "Hmm, maybe there's a door that was just walled over and I could escape that way, but if the GM didn't think of that idea, he'll just tell the player that there are no doors that will work with the key, and the player will figure that's the end of that, and probably not even bring up his idea, which is unfortunate, cuz it's a damn cool idea! (and if he DID think of it then the player may think he's being railroaded or that that's the only "right answer")  And even if he does bring it up, then what happens?  The GM either has to shoot down a really cool idea, or he has to go "That's cool!  So.... ignore what I said about there being no doors that work at all.  There is one."  That seems... kinda cheesy, and I suspect it would break things up more than giving the player some ability to work things in from the start, before the "no keyable doors" fact is established.<br/><br/>So I guess what I'm getting at is that I disagree with this:<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Balbinus</cite>it's a problem about a false assumption of what is involved in GMing.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212865/#Comment_212865" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-17T08:03:03+00:00" title="June 17, 2009  8:03AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a side note, the more we play story-game style RPGs, the more the techniques required to make those kinds of games work bleeds into our more traditional-style RPG play.

Maybe try explicitly introducing the <i>Feng Shui</i> rule I mentioned earlier -- let them know that you're not providing an exhaustive list of every single thing that is there, so they should feel free to ask if some particular item/feature/terrain is around.  You could even give them bonuses for actions involving the scenery as an added incentive, a la <i>Exalted</i>.  Get them into the groove of extrapolating and inventing the details around them, and voila, you've just got the first stage of player authorship in a traditional game.<br/><br/>Likewise, restrain yourself from saying what isn't there, at least not in absolute terms (the old "you don't see any traps" as opposed to "there are no traps" ploy)...especially when you don't think the PCs know everything there is to know about something.  Like, for the artifact-collector's house, until they look at the blueprints they can't be positive that the door in the kid's castle is the only one with a mechanical lock in the entire house, and I don't see why you can't say exactly that to them:  "You definitely saw a useful door in his kid's play castle, but the only other doors you saw were sliding ones with electronic locks.  Of course, you only saw a few rooms in his house, so you can't be certain that there aren't other useful doors in there."  If you call out the times that you aren't providing full information, it'll tip your players off that there's room for them to work in there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marco" title="Marco"><img alt="Marco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marco">Marco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212919/#Comment_212919" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-17T09:52:29+00:00" title="June 17, 2009  9:52AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I deal with this all the time. I think there's a straightforward answer to it: the players know they can "call for a roll" if they have an idea that challenges the GM's perception--and the GM doesn't outright veto it.*<br/><br/>Hypothetical<br/>Player: "So there's no doors in the house?"<br/><br/>GM: "No--they are converted to sliding doors."<br/><br/>Player: "Well, wait--I worked dry-wall and carpentry for six years and I know that very often when people remodel they just wall over the existing doors. Isn't that possible here?"*<br/><br/>GM: "Uh ... you sure?"<br/><br/>Player: "Certainly. We even did work for a guy who was superstitious about doors and really, really didn't want any because they posed a security risk in his imagination--but he was just fine with us walling them up."<br/><br/>GM: "Are you <i>certain</i>? Like, the guy didn't want the same openings in the room he had before?"<br/><br/>Player: "Scouts honor--oh, well, also it's very common--people often want doors moved a few feet to the left or right. So the old door remains in place."<br/><br/>GM: "But doesn't the ... uh ... molding or whatever stick out of the wall?"<br/><br/>Player: "We just remove that. And the knob. And wall it over."<br/><br/>GM: "Uhh. Okay. I give it a 6 or less."<br/><br/>Player: "I did this for like fifty people. We /always/ moved the openings and walled over the doors. Like every time. Check it on google."<br/><br/>GM: (boggled) "Are you shitting me?"<br/><br/>Player: "Uh ... no."<br/><br/>GM: "Okay--nine or less. That's the best you're getting."<br/><br/>Player: "Roll it."<br/><br/>GM: "Twelve."<br/><br/>Player: "I use my luck-factor to adjust the roll by three. DOORS!"<br/><br/>-Marco<br/><br/>* As is obvious from the conversation I find it hugely unlikely that the clever plan would work--does anyone actually change all their doors but also move the openings? How do you wall up a door anyway--doesn't that involve taking off the door knobs that kinda stick out? If the guy was doing it for security purposes wouldn't he object to leaving the actual doors?<br/><br/>But regardless--I have used this technique to facilitate player-driven planning for breaking into secure installations successfully.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_213105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213105/#Comment_213105" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-18T08:36:58+00:00" title="June 18, 2009  8:36AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Marco</cite>* As is obvious from the conversation I find it hugely unlikely that the clever plan would work--does anyone actually change all their doors but also move the openings?

Not like most TV shows (especially Sci-Fi channel stuff) are known for realism.  I gathered that even in the context of the show it was an extremely risky plan.  And, actually, the knob had been removed.  The guy breaking in took a door knob and an electric drill in case he had to put a knob on the door.  And he did.<br/><br/>But realism isn't really the strong suit of most RPGs either.  I'm fine with unrealistic clever plans if they're cool.  Clever, risky, unrealistic plans are awesome.

It's more authorship at the situational level rather than at the event level; but it can not only invest the players more in the game world, it can get them into the swing of driving the fiction forward to their own goals, rather than coming along for the (railroad) ride.<br/><br/>The Mountain Witch Trick can easily be eased into, as mentioned above: start with giving them narration rights for critical successes, then for any success, and then for failures. Pretty soon, you can leave the driving to them and focus on your own acting, presentation, and tactics (as appropriate to the game and moment). This is also a Good Thing To Do when you have an inactive player or two due to the party splitting up for whatever reason: the "down player" becomes the "assistant GM."<br/><br/>Another thing you might try is actually having a PC-as-GM-assistant. Start with your best improver or person most interested in authorial role, and have them make their character with the idea that '"you will largely shape the course of the game as you play." I had a GM do this (secret to the other players, for good or ill) with a character i made for a HERO campaign who had an Always On, Penetrating Transform attack: this guy was delusional, thinking he was living in a fantasy world, and his powers would slowly, automatically, make things around him transform to suit that idiom without changing their actual "points distribution" so to speak: all aesthetics and special effects. This meant that I could routinely interject things like "looking out the plane's window, you see that it is now a hoodah atop a dragon" and get away with it. Mostly.<br/><br/>So to do that in, say, trad D&amp;D, you'd make his PC the party "leader" or "sage" or whatever, such that he could routinely inject world information that, in turn, drives the plot forward. Then, you just rotate this duty around as you can, until everyone's into the act at one time or another... then put them ALL into the job, with something like BW Beliefs.<br/><br/>Or, hell, just play a game with heavy player authorship for a while--Universalis, to go to the extreme--and let them discover the fun. Some might never go back to the "old ways," others might hate it because, ultimately, they just wanted to be along for the ride and comment on the scenery, not be in charge of the engine and boiler.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_213192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213192/#Comment_213192" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-18T12:12:50+00:00" title="June 18, 2009 12:12PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>Techniques are cool, but I personally like being upfront and telling people how you'd like it to work.</blockquote>A well known technique, that is. ;-)<br/><br/>I find your ideas sound, Brian, and your thinking around them too.

We are using Keys for xp, and I turned nWoDs virtues and vices into pseudo keys, leaving it up to them when when think they should be taking points.  This doesn't really give them authorship power at all, though, and they've actually been both deliberately pursuing their keys less than i expected and not taking points as frequently as I think is justified.  I've even been occasionally pointing it out, saying, "Hey, you think you're hitting your key here?  You wanna take some xp?"  I did this primarily because I really dislike the handing out xp job of the GM in White Wolf games, though I've still ended up doing that part of the time since we're currently playing Hunter, and I'm still giving them Practical Experience like normal.  Once we switch to Changeling their xp will be completely in their hands.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>Another thing you might try is actually having a PC-as-GM-assistant.

How do you wall up a door anyway--doesn't that involve taking off the door knobs that kinda stick out? If the guy was doing it for security purposes wouldn't he object to leaving the actual doors?</blockquote>Hell if I know, man.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  It was in the show.  Not like most TV shows (especially Sci-Fi channel stuff) are known for realism.  I gathered that even in the context of the show it was an extremely risky plan.  And, actually, the knob had been removed.  The guy breaking in took a door knob and an electric drill in case he had to put a knob on the door.  And he did.<br/><br/>But realism isn't really the strong suit of most RPGs either.  I'm fine with unrealistic clever plans if they're cool.  Clever, risky, unrealistic plans are awesome.  And really what I'm doing in this thread is trying to sort out in my own head ways I can make it feasible for players to try crazy plans that everyone thinks are cool<br/><br/><br/>Well, sure--and it doesn't matter: the idea is that the kind of question is resolved by players knowing they can ask for a roll and and you'll evaluate it and roll for it and that they can have input and stuff but it won't either (a) utterly fall to them to make up the world (which many people think is bad for immersion) and that (b) they are guaranteed a consistent reality because you'll make sure that if they ask for something you /know/ doesn't make sense it won't be there.<br/><br/>-Marco                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
