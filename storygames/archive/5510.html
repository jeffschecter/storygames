The context is about people feeling fear about playing games, specifically fear about being judged on their performance, both as players or as GMs.</i><br/><br/>When my wife was much younger she used to play in a large LARP in the UK and players got rated on performance in terms of how much XP they were given. That sounds okay, maybe, until you realize that it meant she was constantly on show, constantly being judged, not playing but performing, and worrying about her performance. And of course, because the system was rigged and only the popular people got top marks it left her down on herself and feeling stupid for not doing "well enough"<br/><br/>Even now she still forgets sometimes and worries after a game if she did well enough. She says "Oh I didn't play that too good did I, I wasn't good enough, I wanted to do X Y and Z but I didn't" as if she is being constantly judged and scored. It makes me really angry (not with her) because some assholes basically took away the fun from her RP *and every future RP she is in as well!* (Most of the time she is fine and can just get on with playing and having fun, but it comes up in LARP situations a lot)<br/><br/>Even though that was perhaps an extreme case I've met a number of people who feel some sort of self-consciousness in gaming, like they are being judged, or they are on show, or they can *fail* at it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123719/#Comment_123719" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-01T10:29:36+00:00" title="February  1, 2008 10:29AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've definitely felt this.

It's especially bad in gaming because its much more likely that the people being abused have fewer other places to go. I remember that experience in school, where we had prestige and power groups and all the rest going on in our gaming club as well. Luckily I didn't come out of it with my self-confidence messed up.<br/><br/>On the other hand I was in a LARP recently, and it was full of status play and power groupings and strutting peacocks and the rest, and I swear some of those people were out to make the new players <i>feel bad</i> over not being as good as them, or knowing the system as much, or having as many IC friends, or things like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt" title="Matt"><img alt="Matt" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/6464691/920923"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt">Matt</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123792/#Comment_123792" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-01T13:03:29+00:00" title="February  1, 2008  1:03PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite>On the other hand I was in a LARP recently, and it was full of status play and power groupings and strutting peacocks and the rest, and I swear some of those people were out to make the new players<i>feel bad</i>over not being as good as them, or knowing the system as much, or having as many IC friends, or things like that.</blockquote>\nSadly, that's pretty endemic in LARP culture.

All of my groups, for all their damage, have more or less supported me, especially as a GM. <br/><br/>I'm not sure what the standard was set by. Maybe the invisible expectations of the magical GM. Maybe my own perfectionism in creative endeavors. Maybe because people spent a lot of time telling me how good I was, and I felt a fraud and wanted to make it real. <br/><br/>But even to this enlightened day, I'll sometimes after a game sit there thinking "that was not good enough, not good enough at all." This, while all the other players talk excitedly and plan who is going to kill whom next week and throw shit at each other. I sit there and reflect on what I could have done better, what I could do next time to make that not happen again. <br/><br/>A little of that can be healthy, I think. The unexamined game is not worth playing. But the level to which it sometimes happens to me is not so good. Reflecting is one thing, constantly judging yourself by an impossible and invisible standard is not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123841">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123841/#Comment_123841" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-01T15:29:43+00:00" title="February  1, 2008  3:29PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yes, I go in for that sort of self-judgement a lot, when I GM, because somehow I feel responsible when people don't have enough fun (whatever that is). No worse, I feel *bad* and get really upset with myself about it.<br/><br/>I know one of the Solipsist playtests had that effect. I just hadn't gotten my head around how I should approach the game as GM (for all sorts of reasons), and instead of exploring that in play, as I should have in a playtest, I got into this awful "it's my baby and it and I are on show, and if it doesn't go right then I'VE FAILED" sort of mentality and got totally tied up in knots with it. And when, indeed, some players didn't have fun because of the way I approached it I got really miserable and felt like dropping the whole thing ... all because that self-judgement thing stopped me from analysing what had actually gone wrong instead of just beating myself up about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_124096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/VBWyrde" title="VBWyrde"><img alt="VBWyrde" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/VBWyrde">VBWyrde</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124096/#Comment_124096" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-03T07:59:59+00:00" title="February  3, 2008  7:59AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 3, 2008 8:02AM by VBWyrde.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Beating yourself up is not good if it causes you to give up.   However, in life there's lessons to be learned, and we often learn them through painful experiences.   Sometimes when we're doing something it may be that it really isn't good enough.  And we have to go through the pain of realising that it wasn't good enough before we can find ways to improve.   That's life.  It's normal, and it happens in every aspect of life.   We're constantly being judged no matter what we do or where we go, either by ourselves or by others.   Go to the supermarket?   You are being judged.   Really.  There's the girl over there who thinks your hat is cool.   There's the clerk who thinks you're a hippy and doesn't respect you.  There's the guy who's into football down aisle four who thinks your a nerd and wants to stomp your face for it.  Etc, etc, etc.   We are always performing and we are always being judged.   And this is even more true when we're actually socially interacting with other people in a group setting... like playing a game.   It's normal, natural, and even if we don't like that fact, it is in the design of the nature of reality and we're not going to be able to change it.   However, what we can change, and what is in our power, is how we react to being judged.   If we try constantly to improve ourselves we may take heart that even painful experiences can be a learning opportunity.   Do I think I didn't play well enough and other people at the game thought so too?   Fine... then let me figure out what I could do better next time.  And do it.    Same thing for GMing.    And yes, I'm sure some GMs are on a power trip.   And some GMs simply do not have the skills, of which there are many required, to do it well.   So they're not very good.   That's ok.   The same thing is true for all the arts.   Some people would like to be better than they are.   And when you get to that point you have the choice:  beat yourself up and give up on it, or figure out what you could do better and do it.   Maybe it sounds like I'm being trite, but I don't think its a trite point.  If you can seriously remember that "every pain is an opportunity to find a way to improve" then rather than obsessing about the cause of the pain, you might focus instead on what to do next to improve.  I think that's a positive attitude and one that can lead to good places, not just for Players and GMs, but generally speaking in life.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
