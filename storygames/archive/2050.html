                    Been a while since we had one of these threads, but they remind me why we're here. So let's see what's going on!<br/><br/>I'll post my regular group stuff, and then get into Holiday Specifics.<br/><br/>Monday Weekly game (Durham Three): Tonight is the last night of our Primetime Adventures "Jew Qabbalah Pirates of the Carribean" game. It's been a real exciting game, filled with both Swash AND Buckling, not to mention insane Dutchmen captains, qlipoths, underage touching, Spanish Fireball Amulets, and a living island demon controlled by a voodoo priest. I'm Playing in this one.<br/><br/>Wednesday Bi-Weekly Game: We just finished up a Star Wars d6 two-parter that could be best described as "Feng Shui meets Republic Commando". We were all ARC troopers, which is like a super-super-super Green Beret in the Republic Army. Mad fighting, driving, and hacking. Most of the time we would roll the dice (the ARC troopers have abilities at starting levels that I never reached playing d6) and determine if we "succeeded OK, or succeeded AWESOME", and then got into it from there. Seriously, just like Feng Shui. I even roleplayed out Star Wars computer hacking as exciting as any gun battle. In two weeks we will meet for some boardgaming, and then reconvene in January with new players (Mark Causey rejoins the team!) to play a Unisystem-based Fallout mini-campaign. I was a Player in the Star Wars game, and will be a Player in the Fallout game.<br/><br/>Thursday Weekly Game: My Thursday Slacker Cru is loving the additional slack that the holiday season invokes. We spent the last two sessions in a holding pattern preceeding a Big GURPS Firefly(ish) campaign, and just played Battlelore, Settlers of Catan and Shadows of Camelot.  Le Chiffre went back to France for the holidays for three weeks, so we'll have three weeks of probably one-shots and the like.  I'm totally going to run a Nativity-themed game, either using Legend of the Five Rings or Warhammer. At the beginning of January, we're rolling with our GURPS/Savage Worlds mixup for a year or so, and it's looking to be interesting. I'll be a Player for the start of this GURPS gig, but will later GM in turns.<br/><br/>Other: <br/>There's a few upcoming lazy weekends rolling into view, where most likely some Battlelore, or Tenra Bansho one-shots, will go down. Already planning a lazy event sometime around the holidays where a Jew and an Atheist are coming over to this Shingon Buddhist's house to celebrate Christmas with board games and Guitar Hero 2... and to walk into a bar.<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>

                            We're playing Spirit of the Century on Sundays, a kind of holding pattern of pulp until we play PTA after the holidays are done.<br/><br/>Friday nights have been Burning Wheel, which has been fun.  When people can't make it, we whip out Spirit of the Century, our spare tire game 'round these parts.<br/><br/>And in January a group of friends are going to play the scenarios I have set for Dreamation '07, allowing me to try out my SotC con scenario (Zombie Kong's Revenge) and a new 1st Quest scenario and show my friends the Dictionary of Mu.                        </div>

                            Christ Andy, that's a lot of gaming.<br/><br/>I've got the already-mentioned Jews of the Caribbean, which we'll wrap up tonight, followed by something loathsome in the new year - maybe PTA?  I think I'm on deck to GM.  I'd love to run three or four weeks of Dogs, too.  <br/><br/>In my Wednesday group we just finished a six week TSOY/Firefly game.  It ended with a 50% party kill and 20 orphans in space without vac suits (they're fine).  Next up:  Two or three weeks of Agon and then five weeks of PTA set in a Soviet Gulag in 1939.  <br/><br/>Also!  Playtesting Grey Ranks.  If you are local to NC and want to playtest drop me a line.  If you are far away and want to playtest, drop me a line.  Now is the time!                        </div>

                            So far: <br/><br/>Spaghetti Dogs: A Dogs In the Vineyard game with Mo and Leo, where they play nasty, experienced Dogs who would give characters from any Clint Eastwood movie nightmares. We had mama and whore issues, sisters wanting to be impregnated, and a final scene that resulted in one Dog murdering his favorite whore and the other Dog killing the first Dogs mother. <br/><br/>Unbreakable (x2): Run by Mo, a drifted Unknown Armies meets M. Night game. So far this month we've brought down the Indian Counsel-General, her ring of imported whores, turned the older son of a mob-boss against his younger brothers, broken two girls hearts, and made my PCs finance feel like she couldn't compete with the "sluts" that Arjuna always hangs out with. <br/><br/>Truth and Justice (x3): Our hero, DJ, has finally made the leap from being firefighter to proactive trying to change the world, like the Authority but without the fascist-liberal talking headism. Unfortunately her actions have brought all the nuts out of the woodwork, and now no fewer than 15 major groups are trying to take over the world before she can. So far she's managed to unite a Justice League style group of other supers, stop an Islamic Jihad by murdering the Imam (emotionally destroying herself in the process), and is at uneasy truce with most of the worlds Immortals and the P5 mutant who has taken over China. <br/><br/>Coming Up: <br/><br/>Dogs in the Stake Presidency: A dogs game I'm going to play with my father and brothers. <br/><br/>Spirit of the Century: With Nancy, Albert, Josh, Mo, Laura, and Paul. Not a lot of details yet, but I'm jazzed about it. <br/><br/>Something else: With the same group from above. <br/><br/>7th Sea, Not So Happily Ever After: A year or so ago we had a short run game of 7th Sea with star crossed lovers, pirates, secret conspiracies, and things from beyond the stars that ended in two weddings and a funeral. Now we rejoin our married lovers after life has ruined their happily ever after. <br/><br/>Trollbabe: With Mo and my brothers. Mo has fear, but I know it will rock.                        </div>

                            Dogs In the Vineyard: With the a couple of my friends. I'd never run this before, but after watching it played at MACE, my friend Jon wanted to play this in a bad, bad way. The Dogs shot a Steward, which I didn't see coming. It's fantastic being able to create a town, with all these problems, and not have to worry about how it gets solved.                        </div>

                            We're on a bit of a pause for December as the annual Invasion of the Families takes place, but what we did run:<br/><br/>Our fortnightly Shadowrun game was that ultra-cool mashup with the Shab-al-Hiri Roach.  Best SR session we've run this year.  I awarded an extra point of Karma for the near-total party kill that happened when our overly paranoid mage overcast an area effect stun spell to close out the session. <br/><br/>Our weekly ongoing dark fantasy adventure ended with all the players finally getting on the same page with what's with the Big Bad World-Ending MacGuffin half of us are after.  We also ended the ghost story when we discovered that the creepy things weren't attacking and eating the children, they were eating something in astral space that was attached to the children, so that means that parts of the kids got munched by mistake.  I'm a player in this one.<br/><br/>We also started this Ides of Gaming thing where we're trying to get some of the gamers in our town together in a social setting.  The big plan is to go do some events like head to RenFair together or have a game fest. "Gamer networking" is as good a title as any.  This Ides, we met up with some folks from Jason Corley's group, and did some boardgame fun.  Four player Domaine rocks.<br/><br/>Up later this month:<br/><br/>Not much, really.  <br/><br/>Next month, we've got this planned:<br/><br/>Shadowrun: Vignettes.  The game session we had to cancel due to vandalization, flu, and a cruise will be upcoming.  We've got a PC mage heading to another dimension and meeting some alien storytellers; some of the major NPCs at an Egyptian dig two years in the past; the least-combat ready PC getting stuck in a Die Hard situation; and if we have time in the game session, two of the PCs out for an evening on the town, wacky hijinx ensue.  During all of these scenes, probably one player actually plays his character.  The other players will be playing the NPCs, even though that screws up the whole terminology of "non-player character".<br/><br/>The dark fantasy game:  We finally reach the big city and advance the black market storyline.<br/><br/>Ides of Gaming?  Possibly the Buffy Sing-A-Long at a local indie theater.  We're still developing this whole gathering thing.                        </div>

There's been much dungeon crawling, monster hacking, treasure stealing goodness going on.<br/><br/>Still, I wish I could find someone to play TSOY, BW, Capes, DitV or something else with me.                        </div>

                            Each Wednesday night Snyder, John H, Chris Chinn and I have been Skype-testing Galactic. It's fun, and I like the group, and hopefully when they get tired of the playtesting we'll keep together and play something else.<br/><br/>This coming Saturday? Because I'll be back in Seattle for Xmas, I convinced John to GM a big Savage Worlds event inspired by Castle Wolfenstein. Wilhelm and Johnzo will also be playing, and I think maybe Tony Dowler.<br/><br/>I also have heard rumor of a Nine Worlds game involving Santa Claus, but I haven't officially been invited to it, so who knows.<br/><br/>In January? Hopefully more Skype gaming. I'd like to try my game with another group to see if John, Matt and Chris have been drowning out the flaws with their awesomeness.<br/><br/>Hey, and speaking of... entering nostalgia mode...
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Anemone</cite>Playing: Seattle Gamers Assemble: Monday Night Games</blockquote>
That group was how I got back into gaming, six years ago. I met up with Johnzo and Kevin Perrine and a few other guys to play Silent Death.                        </div>

<blockquote>That group was how I got back into gaming, six years ago. I met up with Johnzo and Kevin Perrine and a few other guys to play Silent Death. </blockquote>
I can't believe the longevity of the SGA group.  Somewhere in Perrine's game closet, there's a mirror that shows an image of an aging and decreipit 1st ed. AD&amp;D Player's Handbook.<br/><br/>My game action:<br/><br/>a) Playing holiday TSOY this week with James N. and others.  Been wanting to TSOY for a long time, finally getting the chance, jazzed about it.<br/><br/>b) Playing in <blockquote>a big Savage Worlds event inspired by Castle Wolfenstein. </blockquote>
Holy crap, I am looking forward to this.  After this game was announced, I replaced all the music on my ipod with Vera Lynn mp3s.<br/><br/>c) Running Dungeons &amp; Savages for SGA in January.  Eight players, two nights, one evil temple, and a Stalingrad bodycount.<br/><br/>d) Running an ongoing Skype / Maptools GURPS 3e Fantasy game with my pals from back home.  It's called Dungeon Seed.  The hibernating Spider Lords of pre-time are awaking and thawing their dungeons from suspended animation.  Our heroes' job is to lure adventurers down into those dungeons so that they can be captured and mutated into spider-soldiers for the Spider Lords' glory.  Probably get back to this in mid-late January.                        </div>

Warhammer nativity.  That's awesome.  I'm picturing the three wise men as a ratcatcher, a bonepicker, and a one-eyed dwarf camp follower.<br/><br/>You could follow it up with a Paranoia passion play for Easter.                        </div>

                            We've been playing Mutants &amp; Masterminds, 1st ed. It's not been brilliant. The stuff between PCs is quite fun but the system is a bit too clunky and slow for our needs and the GM hasn't really got on top of it. 2nd ed looks like a smoother game but it's all a bit too d20 for me. We're thinking of switching to something a bit more interesting system wise although Capes is probably too far from the kind of game we want. I've never really had much fun with Supers games.<br/><br/>This week we play our Xmas game of My Life with Master. Paula will be running My Life with ER - as in Elizabeth Regina. I'm expecting a corgi-littered fun fest.                        </div>

                            I'm in a little bit of a gaming lull at the moment, but things are looking like they'll be picking up again after Christmas...<br/><br/>The TSOY game's currently on hiatus, since our GM is having some family and job stress.  Plus scheduling is a bear during the holidays.  I'm majorly missing it, though, and really want to get back to the ratkin.<br/><br/>The monthly homebrew game my friend Corvus is running is really picking up speed, but I sadly had to miss the most recent session, and no one who was there will tell me what happened because they "don't want to spoil the surprise." *cries*<br/><br/>The very low-key online Hackmaster game is starting off well; I'm playing a badass assassin.<br/><br/>And next week's the first session of The Mountain Witch, which I'm GMing.  A bunch of my players were over last night and we watched "Twilight Samurai" to prep -- they're super excited and I am, too.                        </div>

<p>Our gaming schedule is random &amp; chaotic.  Mostly owing to the random and chaotic nature of my job schedule.  On and off we've been playing our Floating Cities TSOY campaign.  Which has been totally awesome.  I expect our next session to fall on the 31st.</p>
<p>Oh, and we just found out that one of our members is planning to move to South Africa at the end of January.  Which will put a real fahkin' damper on the campaign if we can't tie up loose ends properly.</p>

                            I'm in the midst of some sort of gaming boom right now, playing in the most games since going to university!<br><br>My mid-weekly game is a game of Trinity, which I wasn't looking forward to but am enjoying immensely. It's set in Xiang Gang (Hong Kong) and we're rooting out corruption in Trinity based there. Admittedly we're not going about it in the subtlest of ways, as we tend to jump people and kill them in a variety of nasty ways, but it hasn't come back to haunt us ... yet.<br><br>Then my bi-weekly group is with my brother and his (non-gamer) housemates. We've just wrapped up a rather limp game of Cthulhu: Miami, and have just started a Spirit of the Century game. We had an absolute blast generating characters, and I can tell that the British branch of the Century Club will be very busy come the new year.<br/><br/>We finished the infiltration phase of our Burning Empires skype game a week or so back, and what a cracking way to end! The Vaylen stormed to victory, but not without heavy losses. The final maneuver ended with one of the human pcs failing a duel of wits to convince his duke that the vaylen were infiltrating, and ended up being thrown in jail at the behest of the Vaylen sleeper. But he's not the sort to go quietly, so escalated to violence and we ended with her being killed (one of my figures of note!) and him being imprisoned and tortured. Can't wait to resume this in the new year, although a couple of my players are grumbling about the Infection mechanics (and specifically the disconnect from the scene structure).<br/><br/>Finally my Etherscope game reached the end of its current story a couple of weeks back, so we're breaking from that over christmas.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            I don't know if we get to play before the end of the year, but with faint hopes: an <i>Unknown Armies</i> -campaign of undetermined length. I'm the GM, I've supplied the players short character concepts and a theme song, from which they'll develope their characters - character-to-character -relationships will be developed in collaboration. I've skecthed an initial situtation that will draw the characters into the setting, but aside from that, I'll be in supporting role, and aim for as character-driven play as possible.<br/><br/>Frankly, I'm a bit terrified of the UA as setting.                        </div>

The trick with UA is to handle it in small chunks. Decide what interests you and use that, rather than trying to use everything. That makes it much easier to take in, as trying to take it all in one go is a recipe for getting overwhelmed.                        </div>

This seems to be a very good idea; I've been overhelmed for a while, but now I'm just preparing the intial buy-in stuff and then see what intrests the players, and then play by the ear.                        </div>

                            Yesterday saw the second session of a Mountain Witch game that is a lot of fun. Best I've been in so far in fact. We've got one more session left in which we'll wrap it up with the blood and betrayal. Previously I've only played the game at cons and sometimes not until the end, so this has been good - stretching out a bit. <br/><br/>With another group (but with one recurring/permanent player/friend) I also played Shock: for the first time last week and it set my mind spinning. With this group we've talked about playing Contenders next.                        </div>

                            We had a session of Exalted last friday, followed by a pick-up of Spirits of the Century with Thor and Marhault last saturday.<br/><br/>Very likely nothing at all for the rest of December.<br/><br/>Our bi-weekly Exalted game is on hiatus until after New Year's.<br/>I'm planning to start up a Zorcerer of Zo campaign with my son "when the book arrives", though I may try to run from the PDF sooner.                        </div>

                            About 2/3rds of the way through the first Chapter on a Play-by-Forum Mountain Witch game that I'm really enjoying.  It'll be interesting to see how that goes, but as fast as it's been going (for a forum game) I expect it'll pick up really nicely in January.<br/><br/>January should also see:<br/><br/>- The second town in the DitV game I'm running.<br/>- The proper start to the TSoY "italiante steampunk" in the City of Petrana, which everyone made characters for already, GM'd by me.<br/>- The start of either a Sorcerer/Mu or Mortal Coil game, GM'd by me.<br/>- Possibly something run by someone who isn't me.                        </div>

                            First, full on play test of PEQ on Christmas day. Either Shadows or a hack of Shadows in a haunted house. Some card games and maybe a board game.                        </div>

                            Sundays are Ray's Exalted game, in which I play. I'm quite happy about actually playing; it's been a while. The next month and more of play will be me saving up for Essence 5 so that I can learn Unbeatable Ass-Whupping Technique (not an actual charm name).<br/><br/>Wednesday nights I run The Creepy Game - it's JAGS Wonderland run under Unknown Armies. It's working very well so far. The players don't yet know that their characters are not really insane.                        </div>

                            Oh my, I don't know where you people take your time for gaming from. I'll be happily playing a twice-a-month game from january on, and that will be the most-regular game since six years ago!<br/><br/>In December, everything was cancelled due to family and festivities.                        </div>
