But one of the central concepts of the game was you picked a YoGang (youth gang) and each gang gave you 1 level in that Gang's Skill. This was on top of existing skills like "Get a Clue", "Education", etc.<br/><br/>For example: The Beaver Brats taught you Suburban Ninja.<br/><br/>And these YoGang skills covered a large number of tricks related to you culure. Suburban Ninja allowed the kids to bypass security, break into their parents offices unoticed, and generally pass themselves off as innocent kids when CorpSec (Corperate Security) showed up.<br/><br/>And it when on from there. These YoGangs were rough translation of the more adult professions like Solo, Medic, Rockerboy, etc. But they covered a wider range of more specific and general weirdness.<br/><br/>To this day I loved how CyberGen handled party roles like this.<br/><br/>What other systems after it used such a similar mechanic? I know FATE (such as Strands of Fate) does this alot.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383692/#Comment_383692" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-28T00:16:34+00:00" title="June 28, 2012 12:16AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 28, 2012 12:17AM by Arpie.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What you're kind of talking about there is expanding the Skill Umbrella, a concept which kind of evolved into Aspects in FATE. Unknown Armies did something like that. Taking a skill called "Gunplay" meant that you not only knew hot to shoot guns, but knew people who could sell them to you, how to maintain them, all the little things someone who takes an interest in an activity might know or have access to. It eventually occurred to people that, in stories, a character's trait is a useful excuse to help solve problems. The more leeway you have in applying the trait to different situations, the more interesting and creative the story generated by the game becomes.<br/><br/>The traditional fear is that players will "overuse" or "abuse" a trait if they can apply it any way they want. I do not agree with this approach. Calling any creative input to a game an "abuse" is just a way of saying only the GM knows how things should go.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383693/#Comment_383693" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-28T00:26:39+00:00" title="June 28, 2012 12:26AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            GURPS used "bang skills" like Science! in pulp applications a lot for this.<br/><br/>Cybergeneration was an overlooked gem.

One of the differences I felt with Cybergen is it gave the players and GMs a series of concret posible uses. Each YoGang skill had a list of typical uses and the difficulty numbers involved whiched helped benchmark them. I find a lot of Fate games don't do that. (Dresden and SoF being 2 exceptions.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
