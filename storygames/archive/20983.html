Since black friday kept showing up earlier and earlier every year, consumers are wild and enthusiastic for purchases year round. Trampling in public is common any day of the year. Instead of laws, corporations now handle the enforcement of regulations within their own territories. Without federal regulation, they operate much more like militaries, but try to maintain a friendly public face for the sake of consumerism.<br/><br/>What it is (the big three):<br/>Its a game in which these corporations hypocritically act as shadow organizations that actively attempt to thwart one another through murder, betrayal, sabotage and corporate espionage. <br/><br/>The players are the corporation's indentured operators, doing the corporation's bidding for money, glory and because they dont have a choice. The players cary out missions such as defacing corporate artwork, murdering CEOs, creating hype by staging elaborate public murders to generate demand. They are rewarded for their use of corporate resources and loyalty. They are punished severely for disobediance and betrayal. They are actively encouraged to betray one another throughout the course of the mission for the benefit of the CEO, personal gain and because it's funny.<br/><br/>There's a few systems in here that enforce that sort of behavior. Money being foremost (intentionally). Stealing money, is encouraged as legitimate strategy and money is even necessary to participate (well) in combat. It can be used to get useful stuff (obviously) and modify other player's rolls (for better or worse).<br/><br/>Players might be under current behavioral contract requirements (speak with a spanish accent), or might carry special advantages or equipment (TacoBell Firesauce Lavathrower/interrogation training).<br/><br/>Additionally there is no active health tracking instead company dissappointment is tracked via a demerit system. After 10 demerits, the explosive device in the characters head is detonated. Getting injured is only one way to recieve a demerit.<br/><br/>What im going for:<br/>I'm actively trying to make fun of extreme consumerism and capitalism here. The system is built to emphasize the pursuit of money, and reward backstabbing betrayal for the sake of climbing the corporate ladder and impressing your boss through ass kissing and tattletale type behaviors. I'm shooting for something that feels like a fun party game but plays more like a roleplaying game. I want it to be whimsical and not do anything at all too seriously. The fact that players dont have any rights I'm hoping will cause a shoulder shrug "what have i got to lose" reaction. The link to both the player and GM rules are below. <br/><br/>Let me know what you think!<br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0rQNwd22ivsM3hxSDl5UlVyWlk/edit?usp=docslist_api&amp;filetype=msword" rel="nofollow">Employee Contract</a><br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0rQNwd22ivsSGFDTjlKSjlyZFU/edit?usp=docslist_api&amp;filetype=msword" rel="nofollow">CEO Guide</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/uolmir" title="uolmir"><img alt="uolmir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/uolmir">uolmir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460487/#Comment_460487" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-21T15:10:39+00:00" title="February 21, 2017  3:10PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's something that feel off about this, but I'm having trouble articulating exactly what. On the positive side: I love the Paranoia meets Corporation thing. <br/><br/>The one thing I keep coming back to is it seems like there are both too many rules and not enough rules. What I mean is you have an idea about missions and money as the reward structure and demerits as the wound track and you have numerical mechanics there and so forth. But I'm kind of skeptical that any of that is very robust as a numerical mechanic. It seems somewhat unproductive to try to balance it mechanically when you could just keep all those concepts at the narrative/fiction level instead. Perhaps a game with tight mechanical systems for all that could be developed, but it might be a lot of work. Maybe I'm wrong though.<br/><br/>And another thing I wonder about is from Paranoia. There has always been a dichotomy between Zap and Straight styles. This reads like a Zap game. But without the fallback of clones, aren't the PCs just going to murder each other in the first room?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ferninja" title="Ferninja"><img alt="Ferninja" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/663/n5I0JAA0QAU5X.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ferninja">Ferninja</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460684/#Comment_460684" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-24T22:14:59+00:00" title="February 24, 2017 10:14PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey thanks for your reply! I really liked that too. I read a book called "Jennifer Government" a few years back and it really got me to thinking about the whole "absolute capitalism" thing. <br/><br/>I know what you mean about there simultaneously being not enough, and too much rules. I brought it to you guys because it feels a little unfinished, but functionally stable. I just cant put my finger on whats wrong about it. As of right now it is entirely untested, so I wanna get a handle on any unforseen stuff before I go making major changes. <br/><br/>You raise an interesting point. What if they just murder eachother right away lol. I'd thought about it but I cant say I really thought about it very hard. It could be game breaking if it's interpreted like that.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
