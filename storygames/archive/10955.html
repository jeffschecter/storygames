Normal, <i>mundane</i> people who would not normally put themselves in harm's way, but are pushed into it by circumstances and possibly rise up to the challenge.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharacters like that have seldom been as rewarding to play as I had felt, because often GMs (and other players) have failed to push me hard enough. Most people, hearing about some weird cult in their hometown, wont infiltrate it. Now if a loved one (spouse, friend, lover, child, etc) gets brainwashed by said cult, they might be interested in a more proactive decision, especially if the cops wont do anything (or are controlled by the cult).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn contrast, I often play very energetic, enthusiastic, idealistic characters, who will jump into the action and push other characters' buttons and allow his to be pushed. These characters are more often satisfying because they help the plot move along. It's definitely a safer choice, especially if I don't know the group that well.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_243081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243081/#Comment_243081" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-22T09:25:10+00:00" title="November 22, 2009  9:25AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I share your preferences.

I'm kinda feel like I'm picking on your game, but really, I've been in much, much worse. Your game was the most recent example, the most fresh to my memory. And I have to admit, my character was not easy to bait, because you are right, no obvious relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that's why I wanted to be local. I am metis. I could have family around, both with the Sioux and in the town. I kinda assumed I would have some, I just didn't want to define them. I certainly didn't see them much, I would be an embarasment to them. Perhaps I should have.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also really expected to see more character conflict. I expected the racist to really want to bring retribution to the natives. It would not matter to him whether it was the Sioux or the Apaches who attacked. If they (the white me) were to let it slide unpunished, it would be a sign of weakness those savages would have been sure to pick. (Whatever rationalisation he would need to kill as many natives as he could get away with.) He would have got a bunch of townies riled up and formed a posse. They would have needed a guide. I was the only one available. I am metis. The racist wouldn't have cared much about my feelings on the matter. He would have intimidated me into service. A coward, I would have gone along, then betrayed a side or another, perhaps sliting a few throats in the process.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bounty hunter would want to catch me for the reward, but then, there might be an even greater reward for native scalps after the attack. This guy really oughta taken the Greed devil. Especially since he's described as loving Sioux. But the control-freak would work fine as well. He'd want to keep a rein-in on the racist psychopath. Though the Tyrant devil works better, I think, with someone who's actually in authority. He should have been the sherif. Alternatively, he's deputized by the sherif as soon as the attack occurs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game wasn't perfect. However, I still want to play it to completion. We can still make it better for next time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_243142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243142/#Comment_243142" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-22T15:18:50+00:00" title="November 22, 2009  3:18PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lordgoon</cite>...the storytellers never come up with anything for him to do.</blockquote>\nIsn't that the point of a lazy character <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_243207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83" title="Jumanji83"><img alt="Jumanji83" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83">Jumanji83</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243207/#Comment_243207" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-22T22:27:34+00:00" title="November 22, 2009 10:27PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hum, should I answer to that?

"Threaten his family," you say, "and he will set aside his cowardice immediately and jump across the table and try to shove all ten of his fingers through your eye sockets."  You're inviting them to push those buttons over and over, but mostly you're doing a performance; you know approximately what your character will do, they know approximately what your character will do, and you're all having fun going along with that.  Possibly the downside is that you may feel like a button is getting pushed too often and no one is as happy with the 30th iteration of the show as they were with the first time.<br><br>If you don't tell people, you're basically making them guess.  "He's a coward," you say, "but with the right motivation he would do anything he could to murder you; now, go find that motivation!"  It's very dynamic -- even YOU don't know what will do it, you're just waiting for a moment that feels right -- and it's a lot of fun to just start with a powerful reaction and only go back to explain the <i>why</i> of it later.  The downside here would seem to be that you're basically asking everyone at the table to do the hard work for you (keep trying new motivations, you haven't found the one that moves this character yet!), and if no one hits upon the magic combination that works for you, nothing happens.  Their efforts are wasted, your desire is stymied, no one enjoys it.<br><br><br>I tend (as I suspect most people would) to lie between those two extremes, although I'm definitely closer to the "tell everyone everything" pole.  I can usually find enough novelty to inject into a performance to partly satisfy my desire for a dynamic "I'm not sure what I'll do next" feeling, and I just feel really shitty about making everyone else pixelbitch my character.  I'd rather let them know what works on my character and try to sell the reaction as hard as I can than sit back and tell them "No, that wasn't it."                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_243216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243216/#Comment_243216" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-23T01:01:33+00:00" title="November 23, 2009  1:01AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In an Archipelago game, I played a girl who was completely zen.
