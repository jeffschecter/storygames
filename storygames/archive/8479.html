The Rat Pit.</b>  There's a basement off Gurge Lane that is used for rat baiting.  At the center is a chest-deep hole, and twice a week small dogs are thrown in to kill as many rats as they can.  The best dogs can kill a rat every three or four seconds, sometimes two at a time, and the worst dogs have their eyes bitten out.  Large sums change hands betting on the various contestants.  Upper-class gentlemen (including, on occasion, Duke Elect Baston's dissolute son Arcus) and even ladies attend.  The place is dimly lit and it reeks of blood and rat piss.  The roar of the crowd, combined with the baying of the ratters, is deafening.  The Gurge Lane Rat Pit is a playground for pickpockets and the fashionable set they prey on.  It's also a source of steady income for Henford's rat catchers, who provide four or five hundred rats every week for the blood sport.  "Betting on the dogs" is a good way to meet a certain sort of lesser nobility, and it's also a good introduction to Henford's criminal underworld, the leading lights of which invariably make an appearance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_187761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187761/#Comment_187761" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-12T11:04:52+00:00" title="January 12, 2009 11:04AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            B: The Merchant District<br/>\n<br/>\nEnough generations ago that no one living remembers the reason, one of the Dukes banished the merchant's guild from the township of Henford. Caught between the ruling decree and the fact that the town was still a major source of consumers, the merchants set up a temporary market south of Hen River crossing. Having little choice, the people of Henford moved their commerce to this market as well, and eventually the temporary market became permanent, with the wealthier merchants of Henford building permanent houses around the market.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater Dukes have had reason to regret their ancestor's judgment, as the Merchant District is a district of Henford in name only; By a loophole of kingdom law, the Merchants, being banished from the township, have the right of self-government. A council founded by the six richest merchants who set up the District rules as a semi-formal council of the District, but most of their decisions are focused on expanding trade and commerce in their market, and the greater world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_187762">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187762/#Comment_187762" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-12T11:05:25+00:00" title="January 12, 2009 11:05AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 12, 2009 11:11AM by JuddG.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            M - Glonton Market (edited to take into account the Merchant's Camp)<br><br>The long sweep of the Glonton Market is what most outsiders associate with Henford.  Even locals find themselves frequenting the numerous shops here at least a few times each week.  Every form of commerce the city can bear is found here (provided that the locals produce it - for foreign goods and services, make the hike outside the walls to the Merchant's Camp), and every service not denied by the Sheriff.  Local urchins patrol the area in small packs begging when the trained Beggar'Sqan Apes are not hounding them and splitting up when they come.  Some say the Beggar'Sqan has gotten a bit more aggressive of late since the powers that be lookt he other way at a bit of graft and lifted proceeds if the beggars get quiet in the area.<br><br>One of the most infamous places here is Frenkle's Barbary Shoppe, a barber shop that some say also sells medical services to the less than legal elements that cannot avail themselves of the area's far more open (but monitored) Surgeries.  Amot Frenkle, the owner claims that nothing could be further from the truth and that he long ago put down his cadeceaus after becoming disillusioned with man's cruelty to man.  This would be easier to believe if he was not known to cut the hair of Boss Rangger each week on Thursday.  A man who trusts you with a razor on his neck trusts you with his scars and cuts as well, they say.<br/><br/>The Beakfort Candle Shoppe is also a place of great interest to the city's Crawlers, if for no other reason than candles have been found of late laced with powerful tinctures that warp the mind with their drugs.  Andra Beakfort scoffs that she would ever sell such things and claims she mainly sells candles, sealing wax, honey, and stationary to the upper crust of the city.  Why then, does her back door seem to have as many customers at times as her front door?<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, many more of the shoppes and inns and even a few museums that pepper this wonderland are all quite legal - and thus not as intriguing to me.  I am a Law Crawler after all, and my pay comes from bounties.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_187770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187770/#Comment_187770" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-12T11:22:54+00:00" title="January 12, 2009 11:22AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 21, 2009 7:29AM by Clinton.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<strong>I.

The Holy Cathedral to our Lord St. Frishop</b><br/><br/>In the early days of the town, around the time the Brackenberry Palace was being built, a small group of missionary monks arrived and started converting pagans into their Holy Way. They proved to be humble and solidary, and their efforts to help, tend and protect everyone were deeply appreciated among the commoners. Soon their faith had spread and their ways had been accepted among most. By the time King Mardius Brackenberry ascended to the Throne, they had so much influence among the people that he had to concede them with important and significative concessions.<br/><br/>With their growing power and appreciation, their economical and social standing kept steadily growing. After just a few years they were capable of building a large and splendorous cathedral to the west of the Palace.<br/><br/>Even to these days, the Church remains an important group among the different powers in Henford. They are the main intermediaries between the commoners and the nobility, and the Merchant District's Council antagonize them every time they are able to. There are many rumors, but one of the most suspicious facts is their unquestioning support to Glonton's Market (which, most people think, is the main reason the Merchants have not been able to defeat their competition).

The Stews<br/>This is land owned by the Bishop and is a motley collection of tiny alleys, falling down shacks, waste ground, terrible sights and the smelliest trades in town. This is where you'll find brewers, tanners, butchers and prostitutes. The latter are nicknamed the Bishops geese and frequent the infamous Quaint Lane. A small stream, which used to to be the Tin River, enters the city from the north and eventually flows through the Stews. Here it has become little more than an open sewer and some say that on bad days it is so full of rubbish that you an walk across it without getting wet. Small urchins, mudlarks as they are known, make their living from retrieving and making good items they find in the Tin. In fact, the expression, "in the tin" has come to mean "having come into some money" and is usually followed by a request for a round of drinks.<br/><br/>Because this is nominally church ground, it is policed by beadles who wield long sticks and aren't afraid to use them on anyone breaking church law who doesn't come across with a few coppers. The chief beadle is Pruffock, cousin to by marriage to Amot Frenkle. He has become fat on the palms greased in the Bishop's name and is now rarely seen outside the Hurdled Ford, a low dive on the outskirts of the stews. Whilst he gorges himself on meals of lampreys and pies stuffed with all manner of meats, his men come and go with their takings, reporting to him the base events that have taken place in his ward. And then of course, there is the other door, where anyone, for the right amount can find out the secrets of those who would visit the stews.

Duke Elect Baston is more concerned with wresting control of the bridge toll away from the Merchant's Quarter. His man Octague Pallmann already runs the infamous "Bridge and Snake"... how long could it take to claim it all?<br/><br/>Until the silt drives traders away, the Downriver Docks will remain a rowdy, disreputable area. The town's most famous inn squats behind the Caul Bros. Trading Co. - The Snake Charmer, its sign painted with <a href="http://z.about.com/d/atheism/1/0/Q/T/MinoanSnakeGoddessColor-l.jpg" rel="nofollow">a most provocative image.</a> The most popular hideaway of Henford's ratcatchers, for obvious reasons, the Snake Charmer was also where Crawler Goswick killed Baron Falianus with his own poisoned icepick, during the fateful Red March Duel.<br/><br/>The prostitutes of Downriver are known as River Rats, and often feud with the Bishop's geese. This escalated to open fighting in the streets, and several murders, during Red March, but the months since have been relatively quiet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_187904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187904/#Comment_187904" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-12T17:50:48+00:00" title="January 12, 2009  5:50PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 12, 2009 9:15PM by JuddG.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            C - Bridgebee Crossing<br/><br/>The most important thing that this section of Henford offers is division.  It is here that the bridge is tended by the Sheriff's men and it is here that high walls and close-huddled houses and stables hide both the savagery of the Execution Grounds and the filth and debauchery to be found in the Stews.  The Sheriff keeps his barracks here and the Law Crawler's Guild Hall looms on the Eastern side of the march, and you would think that makes it safe, but this place can have as many dark dealing as anywhere else in the city, but one has to work at it.  The filth of the Stews and the imagined filth of the Merchant's quarter can find its way into the area if the City Guard lets itself go slack. With Guardian Remass Talque running the Guard for Sheriff Talmos Drank. their eyes are watchful as hawks, but spread as thin as poor man's gravy.<br/><br/>The bridge itself is mighty and well guarded.  It was built with a street that runs within it, with small living spaces and storage for the Guard located on either side of the channel within the bridge.  These "homes" used to be picturesque in the old days, and the water was cleaner then and the views the talk of the town.  Now, the tavern known as the Bridge and Snake dominates the remaining stalls, which house people who cannot afford houses deeper in the city, but fear living within the grasp of the Merchant's Guild. <br/><br/>On the south side is where the rich keep their yachts and the middle-wells keep their smaller boats.  The riverside street is filled with simple and quaint shops that sell things for the river-man or those brave enough to go further to the Sea of Palgur.  Rich and the middle-wells that serve them rub elbows with but minor infraction, as each knows his place. <br/><br/>Bounties are posted on the boards next to the Law Crawler's Guild Hall and a runner from the Guild is dispatched each week to fetch bounties from cities as far away as Brislane for the Crawlers to consider.  More law is done by Crawlers than is done by the Sheriff's Guard, who are worked hard enough keeping the peace in taverns and maintaining the tolls, taxes, and courts of the City (not to mention minding that Deity-forsaken petting zoo that upstart Baston keeps)!<br/><br/>Not to say it isn't nice in places.  The tall building here (some with three stories) are often divided into rooms for families and those of middling stature and these blocks will occasionally throw celebrations and have covered dish buffets of great moment.  These celebrations have become a contest of sorts, with each of the sponsoring groups trying to win some merit for the best such party in a season.<br/><br/>Two years ago, Crawler Tulag Gracem won a berra fruit pie eating contest held by the Dorve Block by eating full 3 and 20 pies!  Tales of this sort abound amongst the simple people who call this area home and stay nestled somehow in comfort with "death to the west, temptation and degradation to the east" as the poet Laila Yorkst once wrote.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_187924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187924/#Comment_187924" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-12T19:01:15+00:00" title="January 12, 2009  7:01PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is awesome, keep it up!

The Shining Host.</b><br/><br/>Every summer, the people of Henford rejoice when Captain Cassamorno sails north to Henford, fresh from scouring the seven southern seas for brilliant treasures. In what has become a grand tradition, the black-mustachioed captain first brings his rarest and most precious finds to the Duke Elect, who has his choice of purchases. Once he has picked out his prizes, the Shining Host disgorges an army of rowboats and spills its gleaming booty upon the Upriver Docks.<br/><br/>When Cassamorno sails his mighty galleon up the river, he even refuses to dock a Wellwatch, at the mouth of the Hen, before he has been to Henford - such is the esteem Cassamorno has for the Duke Elect, they say! Hum. <i>They say</i>.<br/><br/>But I have heard whispers of something darker. I would speak of them, but this pint has run dry and so has my purse. Ah, my yong friend! How generous of you, to buy this round. I heard this from a servant girl up at the Brackenberry, a saucy little wench she was! That devil Cassamorno has been bringing mysterious packages for our elected Duke's son, Arcus. You've heard of the "tinctures" in Andra Beakfort's candles, yes? I wonder if this isn't just a "side-effect" of Arcus's appetites, hmmm, know-what-I-mean? It would certainly explain what happened to Sheriff Drank's wife, now wouldn't it?<br/><br/>Oh, you don't know?

It was planted on teh wedding day of King Terrtas Brackenberry and his wife, the soft-faced Anwan (stolen by the Black Ackolan, the Shining Host's ancient predecessor, as a gift for the new King's favor).  Against all odds, their love flourished for many decades until the time of the Third Trader's War, when Anwan, in fury at the King's assignment of their son Prince Gainen to the Fleet's core, cast herself from his company and household.  It was under this tree her form was found hung and it is said that she was left there for three days before Gainen ordered his father hung next to her (for treasons that some say bore trumped-up evidence).  King Gainen had his parents buried beneath that tree in the same coffin.<br/><br/>From that day, lovers have come to the tree to pledge their love to each other in the Winter and to be married in the Spring.  It is said the forge of the tree watches over lovers who stay true to each other.  A single guardsman stands guard next to the tree and the Royal Lover's grave.  It is tradition that this Guard stand as if he sees nothing of the doings of the young lovers.  Some men take to taunting the Guard, who is not to break his solemn gaze and precise duty march.  It is not uncommon for Law Crawlers unattached to a bounty at the moment to "aid" the guard by rousting and fighting those who come to taunt the Guard.<br/><br/>The tree also bears strange fruits not seen elsewhere in the region (no one knows what land the seedling it was grown from comes from).  These berra fruits (green fruit within a hard grey shell) are a common delicacy that is associated with love and often serves as the center of bon bons traditionally given to lovers on the Feast of St. Frishop.<br/><br/>The Kings of old forbid the planting of additional trees, so the modestly large harvest is often a subject of some frenzy, as the Crown auctions off bushels of the fruit to offset tax losses each Spring.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_187930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187930/#Comment_187930" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-12T19:33:52+00:00" title="January 12, 2009  7:33PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 12, 2009 7:35PM by JuddG.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            X- The Dump<br/><br/>Boss Rangger has found a new use for the old trash pile of the City - it is where his enemies go to be forgotten.  In the remains of a century's worth of discarded debris and ballast lay the bones of good men and bad both, sharing only that their paths crossed the plans of the Boss of Glonton Market.  Because of this, some men who live more innocent lives must be careful in carrying out what they do.<br/><br/>I refer to the Trashers, those few sages and madmen who scour the debris for artifacts and tools that better ages have concealed from us.  They live in and collect these trinkets and have heard in the silent night the cries of men and women pleading for their lives. They say (oh yes, "they say") that some of those Trashmen watch with spyglasses and record the transgressions of the Boss's men.  That black book would be worth a few slugs of Rubiat if it could be found - or if its author could.  Truth be told, he may have already joined the piles of the trash he loves so much...<br/><br/>The Guard knows the score, but their jurisdiction ends at the walls and few Law Crawlers will go so far into the belly of the beast without riches in bounty to back up the danger they face.  If I had the slugs for it, I would have long ago posted a bill on Guild Hall, just to watch the fires start to burn away the shadow that demon Rangger and his vile taskman Pruffock cast.  The Duke Elect has the slugs in reserve to do such, but not the motive.

Hmm.  Well, since Judd G. covered the small trail and the Lover's Gate in his V description, I'll assume that T on the map refers to something else.  Something just off the trail, let's say.  So, here, my V/X is now T:<br/><br/><b>T. The Circle of the Goddess</b><br/><br/>There is a flat, cleared area here.  It is roughly round, and surrounded on all sides by dense foliage*.  This frames the sky into a circle that can almost be taken in all at once when looking up.  The edge of the treetops casts a dramatic shadow on the clearing, even in mere moonlight.<br/><br/>Near the edges of the clearing, rough stones are embedded in the ground.  Most of the stones are round or square.  They are covered with moss, and some with ivy.  Local history holds that this ring of stones was created by the Pekt people who lived here before the land was claimed by the first settlers of Henford.  (Many in Henford likely have some Pekt in their blood, though only a handful seem to care enough to proclaim their heritage.)<br/><br/>The clearing has long been held to be a holy site, particularly to the moon and the moon goddess.  Individuals go there to pray for luck or favors, sometimes secretly if what they want is socially frowned upon.  The clearing has a few customary uses:<br/><br/>1) On the first full moon of the year, a very large number of Henford's residents travel to the circle to perform a very complex ritual with specific costumes, instruments, and strange words.  Most simply view this as a cultural rite, celebration, and generic luck-bringing.  Those who lead the ritual, however, claim that it has vital magical significance.  Most of these performers have inherited their roles from their parents, and hint that they're preserving ancient family secrets.<br/><br/>2) When the people of Henford are plagued by natural forces from outside the city (mainly predators, but sometimes also harsh weather), it is customary for those affected to go to the circle at night and request mercy from the outside world.  This is considered a brave and dangerous undertaking, essentially bargaining with hostile nature itself.  Sacrifices of some sort are customary.<br/><br/>3) Hunters or travelers who have some errand outside of Henford at night will often go to the circle to ask for safety during their undertakings.  Similarly, those who arrive safely in Henford after dark occasionally go to the circle to give thanks.<br/><br/>Prayers etc. in the circle are considered more effective if the moon is overhead.  No one uses the circle in daylight.<br/><br/>Some people make sacrifices in the form of leaving valuable objects in the circle.  These tend to disappear rather quickly, and most believe animals and the occasional thief to be to blame.  It's not a big deal, and there's no security watch over the circle; however, if someone is caught taking a Gift to the Goddess, the punishment can be quite severe.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Church</span><br/>When all is well, the Church pays no mind to the use of the Circle of the Goddess.  Most of the people of Henford abide by a few old customs which they deem quite compatible with Church doctrine, ignoring the clergy who imply or state otherwise.  When strife or hard times fall on Henford, however, the Church makes a bigger fuss over other religious traditions, encouraging the people to abandon their ungodly superstitions.  Only once in Henford's history has this gone to the extreme of persecution, during the Great Plague of two generations past.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Undesirables</span><br/>When gypsies, foreigners, the diseased, and the extremely poor or lame are seen using the circle, reactions vary.  <br/>- Those who see the Circle as heretical are likely to view the presence of undesirables as proof of the place's sinfulness.  <br/>- Those who view the Circle as vastly important can get protective, wanting to keep potential contaminants out.  <br/>- Average Henford residents are more likely to approve, and this has been an occasional inroad to greater public acceptance for an outcast.<br/><br/>Idiots who wind up in the circle are viewed by some as good luck, and their babblings as prophecy.<br/><br/>*I can't decipher this map terrain.  Sub in cliffs if that's more apt.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_187949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JCunkle" title="JCunkle"><img alt="JCunkle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JCunkle">JCunkle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187949/#Comment_187949" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-12T20:27:20+00:00" title="January 12, 2009  8:27PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 13, 2009 10:20AM by JCunkle.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JuddG</cite>Sorry if I am hogging the stage here, but as you might have guessed I love color and setting creation.

His wealth, power, and contacts in international trade (and perhaps darker places, as a rumor says he sells to devils themselves when new moons are out and the river grows chill with death's fog) have bought him great standing in the Merchant's Guild and his palace on the outskirts of Henford show that the rebel House of Julla still knows a thing or two about grandeur.<br/><br/>The Sultan is often asked to attend the Grand Masques at Brackenberry Palace by the Duke Elect (who courts the exiled monarch very timidly, as one would a poisonous cerquan).  On such nights, the Sultans palanquin can be seen being hefted through town to the Palace by the pale-skinned and tattooed slaves of his esteemed household.  The dead eyes of these blinded bearers serve as dark testament of a man who knows that while it takes eight men to carry his palanquin, only two of them need to be able to see.  Cruelty and pragmatism that herald his arrival.<br/><br/>Rumors of what wonders, treasures, and heresies exist under the haze of spiced air and the heavy crystal of the blue-green dome of his manse are the talk of the town.  Of all the feared and hated outsiders, he is the most feared and would be the most hated if the Duke Elect had not promised to take the tongue of those who insult his "good friend" (and financier as many in the Taxer's Rotunda can tell you).  <br/><br/>He grows rare fruits and vegetables in a small garden outside his walls that he sells to bidders in the Merchant District. and ships arrive from time to time bearing cargoes he has sent for from afar.  The Guard and some hired Law Crawlers who will do the job scour these ships for assassins before they can alight to empty the first box of cargo.  The Sultan will not risk a drop of his blood even for a pile of slugs.  The Crawlers who do this duty are marked by others of their breed as "Fetrels", makers of demon pacts.   You can often see Crawlers spitting into the paths of these Fetrels as they walk past, but what care the well-paid for the jealousy of their fellows?<br/><br/>The Sultan is known to bring in foreign dogs of strange breed to the Rat Pit but always through an intermediary.  Pultan Yorsa, the severe gray-eyed Dog trainer, is a member of the Sultan household and the strange dogs he brings rat too well for many better's liking.  It is only a matter of time before he wins one time too many and finds his way to the Dump.  The only variable in that equation seems to be how much stock Boss Rangger puts in the devilry the Sultan is accused of.  Why the Prince of Pain would fear a mere devil is anyone's guess.<br/><br/>The Sultan has recently posted a bill with a heavy bounty at Guild Hall for the recovery of a missing dog dear to him.  Is this the beginning of the end for the Boss?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_187956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187956/#Comment_187956" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-12T21:14:03+00:00" title="January 12, 2009  9:14PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I suddenly notice tow things about Our Town (can you imagine a musical about this place?):<br/><br/>1 - It is not at all a "generic" fantasy town per se.

The fortress proper has been dismantled over time with pieces of the foreign stone sticking out where it was reused in later construction around town most notably in the Cathedral.  The tower itself still stands as strong as ever, the upper portions now serving as a library while the lower sections act as a jail.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe tower gained notoriety during the People's reformation.  After the King was killed at the Palace, Queen Pemith Brackenberry and her children tried to flee but were forced into hiding in Archams Peak when a mob descend upon them.  A small contingent of guards fortified the tower and kept it secure for well over a month.  The siege ended when Caul Verley, one of her guardsmen threw the queen and her children off the top of the Peak ending the Brackenberry line.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_187969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187969/#Comment_187969" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-12T22:26:28+00:00" title="January 12, 2009 10:26PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just want to say that this is a very interesting project.

So the gibbett was moved inside the city to the Execution Ground (G).

Doors have been knocked through, sometimes in the middle of fire places, sometimes cellars as the whole town is on a hill.

This is now a large hall where for just one copper you can get a corner to sleep in, hopefully near the fire, and a bowl of potage from the great cauldron. On Thursday nights, traditionally pay day for labourers in this part of the world, the room gets rather bawdy and throngs with people from out of town come to spend their wages. Several groups of musicians compete for space on such nights. Every so often the least popular is ejected until just one remains. It is their duty to provide the music for communal dancing and as a reward they get a share of the night's takings.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_187997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187997/#Comment_187997" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-13T04:39:55+00:00" title="January 13, 2009  4:39AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 13, 2009 4:43AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How about only one entry per person, OK?

Once, this parcel of land was part of the Royal Estate, but it was given over to the peasantry to farm many years ago by Duke Elect Bastaff Artester.  Duke Elect Bastaff was mindful of the risks of siege in the turbulent times that came after the fall of the Brackenberrys, and knew full well that a source of food within the walls would make Henford far more survivable if an enemy came calling.  <br/><br/>Most of the fields in the Close are plowed in narrow strips, in the fashion used across the land, with each strip under the care of one family of farmers.  However, the Close gets it's name from the peculiar style of circular plowing practiced hereabouts.  Some of the fields are plowed in perfect circles, making concentric terraced rings of crops.  The farmers say that plowing in rings around the low hills that dot the Close prevents erosion, and maintains the soil.  Hence Ducell, a local widdow widely rumored to be able to curdle milk with just a glance, claims that the circular plowing is a tradition that honors the Goddess of the Circle; but the truth is stranger still.<br/><br/>The Pekts, in their time, buried their common dead in catacombs and caves, as was their custom.  But Heroes and Kings deserved finer treatment.  Earthen mounds were raised over the graves of the mightiest of the Pekts in that age long ago.  They were planted with oaks, and holly, and clover, for the Pekts raised monuments of immortal stone to their Goddess, but monuments of living wood to their fallen Lords.     <br/><br/>The Pekts and their customs are all but forgotten in these latter days, and none now recall the names of the mighty who lie beneath the fertile soil of Ringfield Close, buried with their rings and bracelets of gold.  <br/><br/>Ley lane crosses the Close on a diagonal, providing easy access for the mighty dray horses who pull the plows and turn the soil, and from that lane, the last standing groves of holly can be seen.  One can only wonder if the burial catacombs rumored to lie beneath the Execution Ground run all the way to the remnants of the barrows of Ringfield Close...<br/><br/>--<br/>DainXB                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188224/#Comment_188224" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-14T05:58:11+00:00" title="January 14, 2009  5:58AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 14, 2009 5:58AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Five more.

Palanquin Dramahouse:</b><br/><br/>The Henford Guild of Dramatic and Musical Arts and Whimsy is remarkable among theater companies for two qualities: they are the only Guild in the surrounding lands to employ women on stage for female roles, and they are a company versed in the Deadly Arts, not stage-swordplay.<br/><br/>This is because they are a haven for the outcast, the marginalized, and the hunted. The Sheriff and Guard know to leave City business or Baston's edicts behind at the gate. Law Crawlers stay clear. And likewise the criminal confederacies themselves would not dare to do mischief to those within. Those few who do quickly become a lesson to others. The Dramahouse is no mere theater building, but is in fact an entire living compound, easily closed off if threatened, or to trap an enemy within. The Palanquin Players, man and woman alike, are skilled in the swift dispatch of a lawman or malefactor, and in time of trouble they can fend off the most fierce siege with the efficiency of the finest armies.<br/><br/>Rumors abound regarding the Whimsy Guild. It is said that at night after the final curtain they prowl the rooftops stealing from the rich to give to the poor--or in revenge on enemies and detractors, or in the service of the criminal guilds, or for mere profit. Theater Director and Playwright Aleand Bastaff is a man shrouded in mystery--folk talk of how he was a celebrated Knight and veteran of many campaigns, who forsook his title and his oppressive Lord to be the People's Champion. Or how he was a master playwright in the City of Dutchmond, until he seduced the king's bride and satirized him in a play, then fled to an obscure township to hide out and dodge his baleful fate. Or grew up an orphan on the streets of nearby Priarbridge Town, fought tooth and nail for his own bread, schooled himself peering into scribes' windows, and came to Henford following a scrape with the Law to found the Guild so none would be thus outcast again.<br/><br/>His leading lady, Dauphria Casebury, is a firebrand and a darling, a sweetheart and a terror. She is also the chief assassin of the Guild when called for-the only thing sharper than her blade is her tongue. Gossips chirp that she and Aleand are lovers, but she never has a civil word for him in public. She has starred in many traditionally male heroic roles in Master Bastaff's plays; prevailing opinion is that she regularly browbeats the poor man until he rewrites the part for her.<br/><br/>The Whimsy Guild finds unlikely allies in some quarters, the foremost being the outcasts of the Downriver Docks--the River Rats especially enjoying the protection and support of the Company, who in return enjoy the River Rats themselves. Some of their best actresses (and a few actors) have been recruited from among them. One way or another, a River Rat is always welcome to a bed at the Palanquin. Such allegiance earns the Guild no friends from the elite, however--the Duke Elect and his proxies apply subtle pressure to the theater's activities, and the Bishop is the Dramahouse's staunchest and most vocal enemy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188873/#Comment_188873" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-18T07:41:52+00:00" title="January 18, 2009  7:41AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's awesome Joel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188882/#Comment_188882" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-18T11:22:49+00:00" title="January 18, 2009 11:22AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            K is the back garden behind a commercial street, abutting the town's western wall.

The family traces their roots back to the Pekt wise women who eased the pain of childbirth with their roots, herbs, and poultices.  The tradition of Root Talker and Soul Eater was passed on through the generations evolving into the present day\u2019s \u2018Mother Surgeon\u2019 \u2013 the head of the Hymerset family and business.  She trains the next generation and guides the continual seeking of healing knowledge.  Vercy Hymerset is the current Mother Surgeon.<br/>\nHymerset\u2019s caters mainly to the upper class of Henford, but there is a friendly rivalry with Frenkle\u2019s Barbery Shoppe in Glonton Market.  This is in fact a ruse.  The Hymersets are actually silent partners with Frenkle\u2019s.  Prit Hymerset\u2019s shrewd business sense recognized a golden opportunity to quench competition and proposed to back Kale Frenkle\u2019s venture.  In return she was guaranteed exclusive rights to serve the aristocracy and upper crust.  The Hymersets also use Frenkle\u2019s to try out new remedies and as a source for their \u2018experimentations\u2019.  Vercy is currently apprenticing Kale Frenkle\u2019s daughter Isabert in addition to her own daughter Cottie.  Vercy took the mantle of Mother Surgeon when her mother Prit disappeared mysteriously.<br/>\nThe Apothecary houses a first floor store front for the dispensing of remedies.  The rear sections of the first floor are the Mother Surgeons office and surgeries.  The upper floors are the family living areas while the basement houses the laboratories.  The nursery for many of the exotic plants used by the Hymersets is located on the roof.  <br/>\nFor all the good the family does for the community, rumors abound about the Hymersets.  Some say they are in league with devils.  Others insist they are themselves devils feeding on the sorrows and pain of the sick.  The most persistent and interesting one concerns the Apothecary\u2019s proximity to Hollas Garden.  It is said the basements of the building are linked to the legendary catacombs beneath the Garden.  It is here, they say, that the Hymersets grow forbidden plants and conduct vile experiments on the misbegotten of Henford.  The old folks tell of \u2018Hymerset\u2019s Haunts\u2019, ghouls who emerge from beneath the Garden on hot summer nights when The Hunter catches The Prey.  They say these creatures enact vengeance on the enemies of the Hymersets.  Vercy pishposhes these stories as just that, stories to frighten children.  But last night The Hunter caught The Prey and there are whispering today of a ghostly figure resembling Prit Hymerset leading the silent dead past The Cryer\u2019s Round on some accursed mission.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189231">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189231/#Comment_189231" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-20T16:13:43+00:00" title="January 20, 2009  4:13PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice one, Tom.

Named for St. Frishop, founder of the Apernathian Brotherhood of monks; that same brotherhood which built and dedicated their cathedral to St. Frishop (N).  Although frequent passersby are unlikely even to notice them anymore, first-time visitors entering through Frishopsbar never fail to note the six spikes jutting from the wall on either side of the gate. Criminals of special note, once their executions have been carried out at the Execution Grounds (G), are drawn and quartered outside the gate here and their heads mounted on the spikes for up to a year. Occasionally they are also adorned with the remains of creatures or beasts which have been a particular nuisance to the town, and have been hunted down by heroes of the realm.  As this gate is also the most likely to see action in the event of an attack, the town's single ballista is also mounted upon a tower here. <br/><br/>Each year on St. Frishop's day, the monks of the Apernathian Brotherhood lead a procession starting at dawn from cathedral throughout the town, finally terminating at Frishopsbar at sundown. At sundown the festival of St. Frishop begins in earnest, and it is on this night alone that the Apernathian followers of St. Frishop are not bound by their oaths (and neither are they accountable to the law for their acts on St Frishops night) - there is, as a consequence, much drinking, gambling, whoring, and oftimes vengeance-taking and even murder. But when dawn comes the following morning, all revelry is stopped, monks become monks once more, and St. Frishops day revelries are put away for another year.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189452/#Comment_189452" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-21T16:09:37+00:00" title="January 21, 2009  4:09PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 21, 2009 4:26PM by JuddG.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            C, H, M, and B seem to present places in the city where decent, hard-working folk would find good homes.
