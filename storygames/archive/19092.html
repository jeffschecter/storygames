Unfortunately, there is some last minute work to be done...<br/><br/>Starting with any elf, pick up a random object and pass it to them: tell them who its for and 'read' from their imaginary letter to Santa. When a present has been passed to you, you have two choices:<br/><br/>1. Wrap it: try to wrap the gift to the best of your abilities. Another elf pours you a drink and you must drink from it at least once every 10 seconds whilst wrapping your gift.<br/>2. Pass it on: pick up the miseltoe and hold it over your head until someone else kisses you on the cheek; that elf then takes the present from you, but you must 'read' the imaginary letter to them, from memory, without the help of the elf who started this round.<br/><br/>Once a gift has been wrapped, the elf who wrapped it picks up another gift and starts a new round by passing it to someone, again 'reading' from the child's letter to Santa. The game ends when all the gifts have been wrapped: the winner is the player with the best wrapped gift, decided by popular vote.<br/><br/><i>Merry Xmas Everyone!</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
