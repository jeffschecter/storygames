Jacobson<br/><br/>These are the results of the interview each of their characters went through in step 1:<br/><br/><br/><br/>Peter Aronson<br/><b>Marcus Quinctius Lupus</b><br/><br/><b>Who do I miss most from home?</b><br/>I miss my mother, who would always have another book for me to read. The temple has a library, but it\u2019s not the same -- they don\u2019t choose books for me like she did. Her choices always taught me something I needed to learn, or cheered me up when I was unhappy or helped me deal with father.<br/><br/><b>Why I joined the temple?</b><br/>To learn, to see new places, to help people, and so I wouldn\u2019t have to become a swordmaster like my father and fight duels.<br/><br/><b>What test did I pass to enter the temple?</b><br/>I\u2019m not really sure. When some pilgrims visited our world, some of them stayed with us (I think it had something to do with mother). I played a few games of latrunculi with one of them (a girl), and we talked a little. When we finished our last game she looked at me very seriously and said: \u201cYou know, you can come back to the temple with us if you want to and become a monk.\u201d So I did.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Andy K<br/><b>General Suk, Royal Mamluk of House Sies</b><br/><br/><b>Who do I miss most from home?</b><br/>I miss the comraderie with the other house warrior-slaves. There is something to be said about the feel of engaging in righteous battle, or having strong men under my command, but in truth I just miss the ties of my fictive kinship with the other men and women of House Sies.<br/><br/><b>Why I joined the temple?</b><br/>I was ordered to send my men on a suicide mission for the House. I woke up. Most of the warriors fled. Some continued on with the mission as instructed. I joined (in truth, led) the ones that fled. After that epiphany, I was suddenly compelled to join the temple, even though I had not ever considered it before. It was a sudden idea that just seemed right. A few of my men joined me, but I have not seen them since.<br/><br/><b>What test did I pass to enter the temple?</b><br/>I... don't understand. A test? When I approached the temple after leading my fugitive men to safety, there were three monks waiting to greet me. They knew my name, and had a robe ready. I found it unusual, as the robe was apparently already tailored to my large frame. I never asked about a test, and to my knowledge was never given one.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ryan Macklin<br/><b>Flynn, daughter of Eriphani, King of the Solemn Height</b><br/><br/><b>Who do I miss most from home?</b><br/>My subjects. They were, as most people are, kind and -- thanks to the kingdom's prosperity and my father's generosity -- rather carefree. The loves to put on parades and parties, and with each birthday the capital city was a bustling carnival. I especially miss the throngs of laughing children.<br/><br/><b>Why did I join the temple?</b><br/>It was on my seventh birthday that a Flying Pilgrim came down to our little world. A girl had written about her mother, I think having to do with her being sick. Her father was one of our few prisoners. But, that is their story, not mine. After this Pilgrim convinced my father to release the man, he gave me one last look -- one of sadness, I think -- and left. After that, I think I began seeing the world differently, and I left home (with my father's blessing, of course) to understand why that Pilgrim looked at me like he did, and why it affected me so.<br/><br/><b>What test did I pass to enter the temple?</b><br/>I wept. As many of us children were waiting outside the temple, well cared for, waiting for our test to enter the temple, tragedy struck. A boy, maybe the same age as me, had a turtle with him. That turtle died, but the boy refused to grieve, because he thought it not to be monkish to do so. I grieved for the boy and for the turtle. The next day, I was allowed to enter, and while they didn't tell me why, I knew it was because I wept for the boy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Justin D. Jacobson<br/><b>Barry Steinbaum</b><br/><br/><b>Who do I miss most from home?</b><br/>My best friend, Scott Lowenstein. We used to play Xbox together like everyday. We almost finished Halo 3 when I left. I'm guessing he finished it with Kevin. No one plays videogames up here. Sometimes I think about going back so Scott and I can play some more.<br/><br/><b>Why I joined the temple?</b><br/>Well, my dad always said it was important to go to temple. Mostly I was worried I was going to end up being a dentist. I want to do something exciting, something different. I think if I ended up a dentist, I'd shoot myself.<br/><br/><b>What test did I pass to enter the temple?</b><br/>I had to recite my haftarah portion ... while they heckled me about my glasses. Pfft. I can do that thing in my sleep now. Honestly, I thought it would be harder.<br/><br/>I'll explain step 2 in the next post...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_107598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107598/#Comment_107598" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-09T17:22:08+00:00" title="November  9, 2007  5:22PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 9, 2007 5:23PM by DanielSolis.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After your private interview is completed, you're brought before Master Low Branch along with a few other would-be pilgrims. Here, you will be asked to declare your new pilgrim name. You will also discover how you are remembered by your fellow companions.<br/><br/>First, each of you must declare your new pilgrim name, comprised of two words. The first is usually an action or description, the second usually a place or thing in or around the temple. Pilgrim names can be austere and regal, humorous and lively or plain old perplexing. Your name is unique to your personality and feelings towards your time in the temple.<br/><br/>Examples: Eminent Spire, Celestial Chest, Whimsical Abbey, Lone Beam, Formal Organ, Intimate Bamboo, Forceful Abbey, Diligent Kata, Last Tower, Striking Chime, August Leaf, Deferential Plug, Sharp Courtyard, Elder Bucket.<br/><br/>If you need some inspiration, feel free to play around with the <a href="http://www.random-generator.com/index.php?title=Pilgrim_Names" rel="nofollow">pilgrim name generator</a>.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Marcus Quinctius Lupus, General Suk, Flynn, Barry Steinbaum...

A boy was admitted to the temple a month ago, and while he is now a very serene monk, he apparently was quite the thief. A fugitive, even.  The mercenaries had tracked him down and were on a mission to bring a faraway king the boy's head. They were arguing for entrance with Master Jrarl when Wistful Breeze calmly walked past him, right into the center of the throng of guards.<br/><br/>"If you must bring a head back to your king, take this one", was all she said. The leader of the mercenaries laughed, but I think it was because he didn't see the look in her eyes. The other warriors, they were looking right at her face when she said it. They even were poking her with their weapons, she had small trickles of blood from her arms and chest. Her back was to us, and I didn't see for myself the visage that held their attention, but it was as if they... I don't know, perhaps for a moment rethought their lives. Each and every one of them lowered their swords, and appeared to be in an almost trance of thought and emotion. Without saying another word, they backed up and walked away. Their leader turned and ran after them, and we never heard from them again.<br/><br/>\u0950<br/><br/><i>Red Pillar remembers <b>Genius Granite</b>'s power</i>: Ah, a supremely memorable event. Genius Granite got in a scuffle with one of the larger young monks (known to be somewhat of a bully to smaller kids, though I never really interacted with him) at the temple, and that monk challenged Genius Granite to a wrestling competition. Instead, Genius Granite challenged him back to a Pranotthana Duel - Unheard of in this age! We don't know where Genius Granite learned of those old events.  In any case, it was remarkable: As they took turns holding stressful balance poses to see who could hold them the longest, Genius Granite kept staying up longer by a few seconds in each form; a small victory but an indecisive conclusion due to the rites. For the fifth and final form, Genius Granite picked the Inverted Reverse Half-Moon. I had never seen that maneuver much less practiced it. That's when I arrived at the court, and I wouldn't have believed the next events if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes:<br/><br/>The older monk held that grueling position for about twelve, maybe sixteen seconds before falling and losing the competition. Genius Granite, however, not even noticing his opponent's fall, stayed in that position with his eyes closed, maintaining a steady breath for over twenty minutes.  When it ended, quite the crowd had gathered: Genius Granite calmly opened his eyes, stretched out upon his single planted hand, and gracefully returned to a standing position. He was confused why we were staring at him with such awe, and had to be told that his opponent had left the field and retired to his cot over fifteen minutes ago.<br/><br/>\u0950<br/><br/><i>Red Pillar remembers <b>Quiet Roof</b>'s wisdom</i>: Quiet Roof was always a bit bookish. In another person I would have been shocked, but with Quiet Roof the event I witnessed was exemplary, yet totally natural and in line with what I've come to expect from Quiet Roof.  I was in the library having a hard time with some manuscripts when Jade Lake came and found me, crying that her comb (a present from her mother, you see, and one of the few possessions she was allowed) was missing. I didn't even see Quiet Roof at the end of the table, but he calmly, and without looking up from his scroll, told her that Angelic Statue was the culprit.<br/><br/>When we asked him how he knew that, he said very plainly that it was midmorning. He could visually account for 2 of her six hearthmates, as they were in the library as well. Wilting Pine was studying under the strict Master Confined Boar, who would not permit tardiness nor absence. Out of the three unaccounted for, Angelic Statue was the only one who had duties that would bring her n contact with the wing that their hearth was in. He then went on to provide further immaculate details of how the others were eliminated as suspects due to things like smells, graces, the times of their duties, and even provided three possible explanations for her motives. Sure enough, Jade Lake and I confronted Angelic Statue, and she broke down and revealed the comb (they made up tearfully). Later, we came to realized that aside from Wilting Pine who was in one of his classes, Quiet Roof never had a class, training session, exercise, tutelage and never even exchanged words with any of the girls.<br/><br/>\u0950<br/><br/><i>(oops, mine were a little too long I think.

I see it in SOTC as well: Fred's personal manifesto is "I want to make character generation as fun as the game".  However, it's clear that in stuff like the above (and SOTC with the "Your Novels" step) that you're also writing the campaign world as you're making the characters.  This is a new step, and it's cool to see how it developed recently, starting with games like SOTC.

Geeze, he wouldn't talk for nothing. I asked him if he played Xbox, and he looked at me like a I had a third eye. On like the third night we were at the temple, there was this huge storm, all thunder and lightning and wind screaming at us through the walls. I thought the whole temple was going to come down. Most of us took shelter under our beds. Quiet Roof walked over to the window, threw the darn thing open, and got a face full of wind and rain. And he <i>shouted</i> at the storm: "Some of us are trying to SLEEP in here!" Darned if that wind didn't die down. Quiet Roof slumbered back into bed and was asleep before the rest of us peeked out from beneath our beds. I've heard of monks standing up to bad guys and demons and even dragons, but never nature herself.<br/><br/>Genius Granite remembers <b>Red Pillar</b>'s power: One day this other monk challenges Red Pillar to a fight. The boy wailed on Red Pillar, who didn't do anything. After the boy tired himself, Red Pillar walked away like it was nothing. What most of the other monks don't know [I followed him to see what he was up to] is that Red Pillar walked back behind the temple where there's this old boulder that some kids sit on to look out and throw stones into the gorge. Red Pillar rears back and cracks that thing with his fist and turns it to powder in one blow.<br/><br/>Genius Granite remembers <b>Wistful Breeze</b>'s wisdom: One of the older monks likes to play practical jokes on the younger kids. [He's kind of a jerk if you ask me.] So he goes up to Wistful Breeze, holding his hand up with a smooth stone in it. He says to Wistful Breeze: "When you can snatch this pebble from my hand, you will be ready to leave the Temple." [Jerk!] Wistful Breeze snatches at the stone, and the old dude closes his hand around it too quickly and starts to chuckle. "Too slow, young grasshopper." Wistful Breeze says, "really?" and holds up his hand with a smooth stone in it. And the old monk looks all confused and opens his hand and the other stone is still there. And the old monk says: "That's a different stone." And Wistful Breeze says right back, not missing a beat: "Really? How do you know?" And walks away cool as can be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_107897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107897/#Comment_107897" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-12T07:52:39+00:00" title="November 12, 2007  7:52AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b><i>SIR</i>, ALL ACCOUNTED FOR, <i>SIR</i>!</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_107916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107916/#Comment_107916" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-12T08:37:07+00:00" title="November 12, 2007  8:37AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But now I wonder if I should have longer memories like everyone else ...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_107922">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107922/#Comment_107922" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-12T08:52:35+00:00" title="November 12, 2007  8:52AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Things are super-crazy at work, but so I'll post the next step this evening.

These relationships are called "Bonds."<br/><br/>The following tangent goes deeper into the system than is within the scope of this thread, but you should still have some sense of what Bonds do in play before choosing one. Suffice it to say they're kind of like a Key from Shadow of Yesterday, mixed with the Thematic Batteries from Full Light, Full Steam. A Bond has certain conditions that allow you to store up resources to make your character more effective in the future. The only way to actually spend those resources is to change the Bond to something else.\n<blockquote>For example, in Futurama, Fry has been cultivating a Bond of Unrequited Love to Leela for a few sessions, but in order to use those dice he's saved, that relationship has to change. He decides to change the relationship to Bond of Fraternity. He accepts that they won't be lovers, but they will still be the best of friends.</blockquote>\nI haven't fully written out the details for each Bond, but <a href="http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dct676c8_60g4hzch" rel="nofollow">here is a brief, incomplete list</a> of titles and descriptions for a number of Bonds that I hope will be sufficient for our purposes. If you can think of another type of Bond that would be more appropriate for your character, go ahead and write that one down but please give me a description so that I can assess whether it should be added to the general list.<br/><br/>Choose one bond for each of your characters. You cannot have the same type of bond to two or more companions. This Bond is your relationship to that character, but that doesn't necessarily reflect their relationship to you. You might have a Bond of Fraternity to your companion while they have a Bond of Vengeance on you. After choosing a Bond, explain how your, their, or both of your memories' led to your relationship being in that state.<br/><br/>In Summary...<br/><br/><b>Step 3:</b><br/>Quiet Roof, what are your bonds to Red Pillar, Wistful Breeze, and Genius Granite? <br/><br/>Red Pillar, what are your bonds to Wistful Breeze, Genius Granite, and Quiet Roof?<br/><br/>Wistful Breeze, what are your bonds to Genius Granite, Quiet Roof, and Red Pillar?<br/><br/>Genius Granite, what are your bonds to Quiet Roof, Red Pillar, and Wistful Breeze?<br/><br/>Finally, a question for all of you, what is it about your memory that forms this bond?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108035/#Comment_108035" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-12T21:36:49+00:00" title="November 12, 2007  9:36PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 13, 2007 10:24AM by Peter_Aronson.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Quiet Roof has the <b>Bond of Renown</b> to Red Pillar, as he greatly admired how Red Pillar risked the jellyfish fever to minister to the sick. (Growing up the descendent of many generations of swordmasters, Quiet Roof perhaps takes normal physical courage for granted, but courage in the face of a danger against which strength and skill provide no protection impressed him greatly.)<br/><br/>Quiet Roof has the <b>Bond of Debt</b> to Wistful Breeze, as she saved his life from the storm.  (Quiet Roof had believed he dead, that the storm would kill him no matter what he did, when Wistful Breeze appeared, sudden as a lightning bolt, and saved him, showing a power he never knew existed until then.)<br/><br/>Quiet Roof has the <b>Bond of Fascination</b>* to Genius Granite, as he seeks to understand the strange world Genius Granite comes from, and his odd pieces of knowledge. (None of Quiet Roof's books describe the world Genius Granite comes from, nor any world much like it.  Quiet Roof hungers for knowledge of that world.)<br/><br/>* Bond of <b>Fascination</b>: You want to understand as much as possible about your companion. An alternate name for it might be Bond of Curiosity. <br/><br/>All and all perhaps a little on the positive side, but that's how I see this character.  (I went back and added the parenthetical comments to expand on Quiet Roof's reasoning.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108091/#Comment_108091" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-13T09:52:58+00:00" title="November 13, 2007  9:52AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wistful Breeze has the <b>Bond of the Mission</b> to Genius Granite.  She remembered that even though he survived his trial of fire with master Gracious Windmill, he did not look happy.  Wistful Breeze took it upon herself to find something she knows will bring him happiness, the mysterious thing he calls an "ex-box."  Though she has asked him many times, she doesn't quite know what she's looking for, but that will not stop her.<br/><br/>Wistful Breeze has the <b>Bond of Unrequited Love</b> to Quiet Roof.  Her admiration of his strength and his mind, coupled with his seemingly disconnected nature, has turned into something more.  Sadly, she is not a book, so she fears that he will never look at her the way he looks at an old, dusty novel.  She did not realize how strong her feelings were until fateful day with the storm, when she found the power within herself to dance it to calmness.<br/><br/>Wistful Breeze has the <b>Bond of Renown</b> to Red Pillar.  Red Pillar is so much more mature and worldly.  He has seen things, tragic things, that she has only heard about.  Indeed, the quiet strength he showed on that day with the boy and his challenge makes her feel small and childish.  Perhaps if she can been seen as a peer in his eyes, she will finally feel more grown up.  This is why she risked herself that day with the mercenary group at the temple gates, though that did unlock a hidden fearlessness inside her that only proves to her that seeking Red Pillar's approval is the correct path.<br/><br/>In writing this, I think I've found that Wistful Breeze wants to please everyone.  I think she's happy-go-lucky, unless provoked, and she wants everyone else to be as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108156/#Comment_108156" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-13T16:22:57+00:00" title="November 13, 2007  4:22PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey all, just popped in to say that it's been hell at work today, and tonight I'm busy as hell (wife gets back after a month overseas), am thinking about them but will not be able to post for about 24 hours.<br/><br/>Also, when I was thinking of some bonds in my mind, I totally thought of...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Peter Aronson</cite>* Bond of<b>Fascination</b>:</blockquote>\n...as well, between Red Pillar to Quiet Roof, even before I saw Peter's post above.

Like how Uncle Iroh gets a kick (and XP!) out of making Zuko mad, because he knows Zuko really loves him.<br/><br/>-- Protection is likely to be kinda lame, I think.  It makes sense for NPCs, not PCs.  How would Avatar be if Katara depended on Sokka for protection?  Yuck.<br/><br/>-- Redemption seems like it could be something like Teaching, a bit less extreme, since we're not saving souls here.  Zuko and Uncle both have this towards each other, right?  Zuko tries to get Uncle to act like a real Fire Nation general.  Uncle tries to get Zuko to chill the fuck out.<br/><br/>-- Power also seems kinda lame.  And it seems like Teaching could cover things like Bossy.<br/><br/>-- Seems like Unrequited Love should cover crushes too, not just "deep love," which might be too much to ask of kids.<br/><br/>-- Vengeance is also a little extreme.  Bitterness is good.  Jealousy is better (Best Friends!).<br/><br/>-- Worship is a little extreme too.  Kids look up to each other.  They have unfair expectations of each other.  Worship is less fun to play out.<br/><br/>-- Prejudice and Distrust (which doesn't specific why they dislike someone) would be better than Xenophobia.<br/><br/>Just some thoughts.

The basic system for now: In order to resolve an action, you draw four stones of three possible colors. You'll assign a set of matching stones to represent your degree of success and another set to represent the strength of your motivation.<br/><br/>What if your draw brings up three colors, like a pair of black, one white and one gray? If you're using a skill or ability noted in your character sheet, you can use the extra stone as a wild card, adding it to either set.<br/><br/>That's just one idea, but I'm not sold on it. If I don't use it, I might go back to a two-color system and have players draw three stones instead. Again, not sold on anything yet until I test it with a group.

Tell me if it sounds plausible and not too heavy-handed.\n<blockquote>People of all ages travel to the Flying Temple to seek the wisdom of enlightenment. Once they've passed certain initiation rites, they're allowed to become monks. If someone comes to the temple when they're already an adult, it is assumed that they already have enough life experience to decide their life's path.<br/><br/>However, not all initiates are adults and not all monks become pilgrims. Sometimes young children, even babies, find themselves at the temple's doorstep. The elders allow these exiles, orphans and runaways to enter the temple without the standard initiation, but it is understood that once these children reach the Age of Choices, they must go on a pilgrimage to discover if they want to stay into adulthood.<br/><br/>The Age of Choices is a time shortly after puberty, when the weight of adulthood gradually begins to fall on a child's shoulders. The pilgrimage is meant to give a young monk enough life experience to decide whether to remain at the temple or pursue a new life in the outer worlds.</blockquote>\nThe question of the pilgrim's age is a lot like the question of how letters travel thousands of miles to the temple.<br/><br/>For the latter question, I just said "Write a letter then hide it somewhere special. It will disappear and pilgrims will arrive shortly thereafter."<br/><br/>For the former, I hoped to provide a similar hand-wavey, but reasonable explanation.

In fact, I rather like that in general you don't try to explain too much.  <br/><br/>Thinking about it more, it might even be a strength not to explain too much.  My daughter writes a fair bit of fanfiction of various sorts, and she has noted to me that it is easiest to write fanfiction for video game settings, as they are described in such a sketchy fashion as compared to a show, movie or book, that they leave more room for the fanfiction author to place their own creations without contradicting the setting's canon.  The letters you are soliciting strike me as a form of fanfiction, and by not going too much into detail you make it easier to fit them in.  Actually, the <em>character creation process</em> for <b>Do</b> strikes me as a form of fanfiction writing as well, and thus it benefits from the sketchy background in exactly the same way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109373/#Comment_109373" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-23T11:01:39+00:00" title="November 23, 2007 11:01AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Peter said.
