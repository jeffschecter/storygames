I've been asked by a friend recently, do I know any books, adressed to the <i>players</i>. There's like a zillion of books about how to GM - every aspect of running a game is covered somewhere, but I could't remember any single one about how to play: how to behave at the table, how to prepare to the game, how to act, anything at all.<br/>Since I am by no means the smartest GM in the world - perhaps someone here knows more (could't be, that there's nothing)<br/>What books (like anything written at GnomeStew, or by Robin Laws, or, well, there are tons of those, realy) would you remember that aim to help players to play better? What are your favorite ones? What other books could be used (like, may be, lessons for stage actors for example)?<br/>Thank you.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448400/#Comment_448400" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-07T12:13:50+00:00" title="September  7, 2015 12:13PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that generic books on how to play are pretty difficult; the appropriate books depend on the game you're playing. The rules text of the game is foremost to my mind in this regard. It is commendable for players to be committed enough to the game to want to read a book to improve their play, certainly.<br/><br/>A more general book would need to be focused on a given creative goal-set of play, if not to a single game per se. For example, there are treatises (might be books as well for all I know) on how to play Nordic immersive games appropriately, but the precepts and advice would be at best irrelevant and at worst highly inappropriate for other sorts of games. Roleplaying as a medium is so varied that a generic guide to playing (or GMing) will be a bad book pretty much by definition, as far as my understanding goes.<br/><br/>That being said, I think that the notion that players should read the same books GMs are reading is highly satisfactory: I think that dividing the roles from each other so far as to encourage them to study different sources of information altogether ultimately leads to a fracture in creative understanding as the participants in play no longer understand each other. For this reason my recommendation of reading the same rules texts, setting texts the GM is using; a player who understands what the GM is doing, and why, is a player able to respond appropriately and with an understanding of what the GM is hoping to happen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448401/#Comment_448401" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-07T12:26:17+00:00" title="September  7, 2015 12:26PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 7, 2015 12:26PM by Rickard.">edited September 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We just discussed this in the game design group I attended to last week. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Player techniques.<br/><br/><i>Trail of Cthulhu</i> and <i>Unknown Armies</i> got sections in their books in how to be a good player for those games.

If one considers it in the restricted sense of rules mechanics, then game-specific advice may very well be fairly system-neutral, or at least applicable to several different rules systems.<br/>Even if system in considered in the extended sense - how the group decides what is true in the fiction - same advice can be useful for a handful of similar games or systems.<br/><br/>Advise such as "use the foo tokens in such and such a way" probably does not translate easily. Advice for writing beliefs in Burning wheel, on the other hand, is somewhat useful for any character-driven drama game with fairly traditional player role. Both of these are game-specific advise, and even system-specific in the extended sense of system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448497/#Comment_448497" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-12T17:24:39+00:00" title="September 12, 2015  5:24PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, good point.

I personally think that we have not seen many advice texts worth the name outside specific games (for GMs or players), but were one to write some, it would be useful to know the lay of the land, so to speak.<br/><br/>I'll suggest a few classes of games where my experience indicates that play skills are highly transferable between individual games:<br/><br/><b>Scenario-structured drama:</b> Whether playing Sorcerer, Dust Devils, Primetime Adventures or anything of that ilk, the player in these games wants to recognize the character concept that harmonizes with the scenario and fills it thematically, then they want to express that character powerfully and boldly, and finally they want to resolve the character's crisis in a compelling and decisive manner. They also want to facilitate other players doing the same. The skills related to these tasks are highly transferable, and I believe that a general guide to playing games like these would be feasible despite the differences between the games.<br/><br/><b>Challenge-based adventure team:</b> Old school D&amp;D, Tunnels &amp; Trolls, Traveler, certain ways to play Call of Cthulhu, and a large number of other games all have their basis on group organization towards problem-solving; the relevant player skills are about getting along, organizing effectively, visualizing imaginary space precisely, inventing credible solutions, withstanding emotional pressures and knowing the subject matter well. Most of these skills, even the subject matter one (if you're the sort to learn about medieval combat, you're also the sort to learn about speculative terraforming practices), are transferable, and again I would not consider a general guide to playing games like this to be a stupid idea - you could write about e.g. party leadership practices, taking turns as active and passive players, book-keeping tips and tricks, and so on.<br/><br/><b>Character immersion freeform:</b> It is a common conceit that "roleplaying" is about letting the GM drive and focusing your own attention at character immersion and acting towards the GM's material in ways that put that immersion to use. This is credible to players in certain subcultures because it really is a transferable attitude that can be at least tried out in many different games. While there aren't many explicit game texts for this style of play, I think that a general guide would nevertheless be feasible - the fact that most games of this kind are non-commercial and non-distributed doesn't mean that it doesn't exist, after all. A player guide could explain immersion, provide tools and means for getting it up quickly (perhaps the most annoying part from the GM's viewpoint, the need to coax players...), and advice about how to enjoy play and be an asset even while immersing. Sounds doable to me.<br/><br/>I'm sure there are other playstyle classes towards which one could feasibly write a player guide.

Like you, I've found that materials are either 1) directed entirely at GMs or 2) focused on system mechanics and not player behavior. I'm aware of Hamlet's Hit Points and Play Unsafe but have yet to dedicate my limited to books which may or may not dive more into gaming theory than I care to right now. <br/><br/>So...<br/><br/>First, I've been reading and listening to other games. It becomes easy to identify bits that you do and don't like and bits that are great and help you as a player. Posting from my phone, so below are links to one of the greatest PbP reports (or games!) I've ever read as well as a very well produced podcast that's a lot of fun to listen to (would summon James D'Amato of <a href="/forums/profile/ONE_SHOT">@ONE_SHOT</a> to thread if I knew how...)<br/><br/>Second, I've found that there are blog posts - not books - that scratch the itch. A lot of times they do say things like "bring dice and snacks" but they also talk about player and character agency. Creighton Broadhurst may be writing for the d20 crowd but does have some gems for all to appreciate. <br/><br/><br/>============<br/>Actual Play:<br/><a href="http://www.forumopolis.com/showthread.php?t=107933" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.forumopolis.com/showthread.php?t=107933</a><br/><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17329/world-of-dungeons-dungeon-girls" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17329/world-of-dungeons-dungeon-girls</a><br/><br/><a href="http://www.oneshotpodcast.com/campaign" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.oneshotpodcast.com/campaign</a><br/><br/>Blogs:<br/><a href="http://lookrobot.co.uk/2013/06/20/11-ways-to-be-a-better-roleplayer/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://lookrobot.co.uk/2013/06/20/11-ways-to-be-a-better-roleplayer/</a><br/><br/><a href="http://www.creightonbroadhurst.com/gaming-advice/player-advice/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.creightonbroadhurst.com/gaming-advice/player-advice/</a><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448569/#Comment_448569" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-16T13:48:46+00:00" title="September 16, 2015  1:48PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a big fan of LookRobot's advice on this, actually.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448573/#Comment_448573" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-16T14:14:58+00:00" title="September 16, 2015  2:14PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Play Unsafe</i> is excellent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ericvulgaris" title="ericvulgaris"><img alt="ericvulgaris" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/601/nJV8DKZOO3TSE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ericvulgaris">ericvulgaris</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448585/#Comment_448585" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-16T22:14:58+00:00" title="September 16, 2015 10:14PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 16, 2015 10:16PM by ericvulgaris.">edited September 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Like how many others have mentioned, actual books on the matter are rare.

Its actually aimed at people doing theatre improvisation, but there can be a bit of crossover. <br/><br/>It has some interesting and helpful thoughts on things like spontaneity and creativity that could address a rather common problem I have found over the years with many new players - feeling uncomfortable and uncertain about what they can say and do a game. It also has some great advice on co-operation, how people can have input either accepted or blocked that can translate well into roleplaying. That can address the issue of some players excluding or steam rollering others, especially new ones.<br/><br/>Something integrating that advice in more rpg and story game specific ways could be really handy... I would say its definitely worth a read though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
