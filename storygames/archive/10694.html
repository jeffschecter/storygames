Stuff like "the scent of my mother's perfume" and "a concealed coil of wire" and "passionately stubborn". You invoked those for bonuses.<br/><br/>Recently, instead of attaching bonuses directly to all four (which then required you to shoehorn your aspects in all the time for maximum bonuses) I had you create four Aspects, and seperately choose two Gains (mechanical bonuses)... During a conflict/test you would invoke an Aspect to tag a Gain... thus only ever invoking two Aspects in a given conflict, because there were only two Gains to tag.<br/><br/>I liked that...<br/><br/>In working on the most recent version of the character sheet, I have broken down some of the rigidity of class / profession / background, and used open-ended questions (kinda like Don't Rest Your Head): What is your role in society? What makes you commit crimes? What do you hope to achieve?<br/><br/>It occurred to me that you could just remove Aspects all together... and have people invoke these questionnaire answers to tag their Gains.<br/><br/>So... people who have played Perfect, what do Aspects provide that these answers couldn't?<br/>Should I keep Aspects?<br/>Should I try dropping them from the newest version?<br/><br/>The answer of: <i>I don't know, but there's no harm in trying it, is there?</i> is not a particularly useful answer, because there is a harm in trying it - I could invest a lot of time and energy in seeing if this new model works, and if it doesn't I will have to return to the drawing board / old model.<br/><br/>So, my question: is this idea good? why or why not?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237229">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237229/#Comment_237229" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-13T13:57:39+00:00" title="October 13, 2009  1:57PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joe,<br/>\n  I like it!

Originally they were check-off-once affairs, then they went to check-off, then pay a fate point to uncheck. Finally the FATE guys realized they were just channeling fate points through Aspects and that's where they are at now.</p>\n<p>I like what Brad has been doing with this with Diaspora and a new super-secret project. Namely, you can only use one Aspect from one scope: personal, opponent's aspects, environmental, and global to the campaign. I may be missing one but you get the idea. With the new project, in chargen you can choose to either buy another Aspect, or a new scope. So you might in one phase buy "Must get revenge on Dr. Schloss," and the additional scope "My lab". Then in future phases you can buy Aspects to do with "My lab".</p>\n<p>I know your Aspects are of course somewhat of a different deal, but it seems to me there may be another axis lurking in there, that you can tap more explicitly. I think it's good to have Aspects, and a source of "fuel" for them so that they are not, as you say, shoehorned into every possible available interaction. I think the Aspect + Gain is going to add more interest &amp; flavour than just dropping aspects.</p>\n<p>Does that make sense?</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_237277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237277/#Comment_237277" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-13T16:33:21+00:00" title="October 13, 2009  4:33PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, it does.<br/>Thanks, JB!<br/><br/>It'd be interesting to try something like Aspect/Scope from [Brad's secret project that has a name that makes it sound like it's slash fic]. Hm.<br/><br/>Because then you could have someone create a character like:<br/><br/><b>My Tools</b><br/>A trusty coil of wire, concealed<br/><b>My Motivations</b><br/>To topple the Duke of Scorta<br/>To win the hand of Lady Imlington<br/><b>My Allies</b><br/>Jacob, the butler<br/><br/>or:<br/><br/><b>My Motivations</b><br/>To subvert the Abigailist Church<br/>To stir revolt in the Urstworth District<br/><b>My Allies</b><br/>Constance, the dignitary<br/>Isabelle, the lady who I've blackmailed<br/>Mortimer, the simpleton with fierce hands<br/><br/>And then you start to build some pretty cool characters, who are measured not by some universal metric, by by their own priorities (measured by scopes!) This allows for the creation of someone who's all Tools &amp; Secrets (Dexter Morgan!) or someone who's all Motivations &amp; Allies &amp; Societies.<br/><br/>If I went this route, I'd like to provide a list of Scopes... what would it include? Motivations, Tools, Allies, Societies, Knowledge...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J%20B%20Bell" title="J B Bell"><img alt="J B Bell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J%20B%20Bell">J B Bell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237278/#Comment_237278" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-13T16:42:50+00:00" title="October 13, 2009  4:42PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Yeah, cool, exactly. Then if you still want some interesting creative constraints, you can link specific Gains to only certain Scopes. I'm not sure what Gains are but a Gain that works only with a Motivation or an Ally has an obvious flavour to it, just as would one that you can only use with Knowledge or Societies, and so on.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
