Seriously.  I haven't browsed for something new in the last few months but Sons of Kryos and HG,WT were the two RPG/boardgame podcasts I most looked forward to.  Kryos has cut back to monthly and HG,WT is gone.<br/><br/>Kryos, while awesome, is doing nothing like what HGWT was doing.  I've listened to, and have varying opinions of (off the top of my head) the Godzilla Gaming podcast, Chimera Creative, the Independent Insurgency, Fear the Boot, Yog, 2d6 Feet, Ogrecave, Midnight's Lair, Bear's Grove, Durham 3, Theory from the Closet, Gamer the Podcasting, Master Plan, D&amp;D, and the Voice of the Revolution.  Except for VotR, none of those podcasts were doing anything like what Tevis was doing.  I don't remember any of the half-dozen boardgame only podcasts I used to subscribe to; I stopped subscribing to all of them because they were mediocre.<br/><br/>Anyway,  I'm bummed about it.  I know there's a ton of RPG podcasts out there, but most of either aren't very good or are decent-to-good but are doing something very different from HG,WT was.<br/><br/>Even if you disagree and name several podcasts I should check out, "story" games have lost a HUGE crossover advocate forum; there are a kerjillion more Euro boardgame hobbyists than small-press RPG gamers.  A lot of those meeple pushers were exposed to Dogs, Polaris, Burning Wheel, and many others through HG,WT.  Me among them.<br/><br/>This niche-of-a-niche hobby could use someone with the energy and enthusiasm of Fred Hicks combined with the platform that Tevis built.  Someone who covers boardgames too so the ear of that demo is not lost.  It would be cool if someone could step up and try to fill Paul's shoes/niche in the gaming podcasting world.  It could even be an existing podcast that changes its format a bit.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa" title="Mike Montesa"><img alt="Mike Montesa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2395/2470886071_32bd4c6f2f.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa">Mike Montesa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152782/#Comment_152782" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-24T18:15:16+00:00" title="June 24, 2008  6:15PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a podcaster myself (Godzilla Gaming Podcast) I know where Paul is coming from when he says others are doing it better than he does.

Now, I'll humbly disagree with him on this point, but I'll also say that I'm glad he's done so now than before any potential low energy/fatigue actually made that statement true.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Clyde L.

There are few people who can pull off a solo show like Paul can.  I will say that, as someone who started by biting on Paul's style before finding my own, I've seen how hard it is to make a good solo show -- it is not easy to make one disembodied, unresponsive voice interesting &amp; listenable for 30 minutes.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jessecoombs</cite>I think it's interesting that "Last Night on Earth" sounds like the type of board game that Paul said he wanted a few episodes back.</blockquote>\nIt's co-op, so we find ourselves being social about the game itself, and not externally social.
