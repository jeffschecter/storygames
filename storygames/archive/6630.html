I wanted to give my wife a bit of a break in her day.  So I took my seven-year-old son with me to buy Shadowfell.<br/>\n<br/>\n"Can I play this game, daddy?" he asks.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt don't get much better than this.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe peered at the outside of the packaging all the way home, then gleefully opened the package once we were at a table.  We flipped past the rules summary, and he fixated on the character sheets.  "Are these all mine?"  "Yep, they're all yours."  "There's nothing <b>written</b> where it says Name.  Do I get to name them myself?"  "You get to name them yourself."  "AWESOME!"<br/>\n<br/>\nHe named the Fighter Pieter (pronounced "Pighter"), the Cleric Eric, the Rogue Mogue, the Wizard Mizard and the Paladin Morn.  Because, really, the Paladin is DragonBORN, and my son (no dummy) immediately shyed away from trying to find something to rhyme with "Paladin."<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don't have any authorized D&amp;D; miniatures, but we have boxes full of Lego mini-figs.  I color-copied the sheets from the quickstart book and handed them over to my son (hereinafter, "D") who pored through all of the legos on-hand in order to mimic the character portraits as closely as possible.  He's got a little human wizard with an occult-book-tile in one hand, and a burst of flame in the other.  He's got a rogue halfling with stylish hair and a jauntily held crossbow.  He spent, maybe, an hour all told getting these guys right.  I have pictures, and once I figure out the best way to post them, I'll link to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we went through the first encounter.  D <i>immediately</i> grasped the use of the abilities, got the distinction between At-Will, Encounter and Daily, and was fairly careful about hoarding his resources.  As he started running low on enemies, he started looking around for places to usefully apply his Encounter powers, if only to get some bang for the buck.  For those who worry that there's too many powers, and that it will flood people and take them out of their enjoyment:  A seven year old can run five characters simultaneously, without breaking even a light sweat of exertion.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter <i>one</i> Attack of Opportunity upon him, he grasped the consequences of AoO.  He got Mizard the <i>heck</i> back from the combat, and put Eric in a choke-point between oncoming forces and any access to Mizard.  He started moving his characters around the edges of any enemy contact-zone, then came in from a diagonal, often to the back corner, in order to leave more room to give other guys access to move straight up if the occasion warranted.  I mention these things because I was quite surprised to see them cropping up with no explicit instruction.  But, then, he's played Memoir '44, so he may well be importing knowledge.  There's also the kobold shifting ability, which makes it all but impossible for the <i>PCs</i> to take advantage of AoOs ... dunno whether I'd consider that a bug or a feature, in an introductory adventure.<br/>\n<br/>\nD was very pleased with Minions.  I am very pleased with Minions.  The first minion to come in contact with the group got smacked with a magic missile in no time flat.  I tipped the little mini-fig over, then for good measure I pulled off the legs and head, leaving the dismembered little legos in the middle of the road.  "YAY!" D cried.<br/>\n<br/>\nD didn't really seem to think that the kobold shifting ability was all that deadly ... which may <i>very well</i> be because I didn't know how to use it to best advantage.  In retrospect, I look at it and say to myself "Ah!  I see what I needed to do there ... I needed Minions combining their movement-shift and their ability-driven free shift in order to flank right the heck around someone without suffering AoO, in a way that would force PCs to shift back from the Dragon-shield warriors ... that would let them use their Dragonshield training to shift in response, and I could either (a) maintain the flank or (b) get huge mob bonusses on an unexpected target nearby in the battle."  So ... fodder for the poor, foolish <i>adults</i> who dare try to take me on :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut in this run-through, the shifting was mostly "Oh man, give me a chance to get the heck <i>away</i> from these guys," only there was no central group of kobolds left for anyone to run to.  The delight D expressed as each minion was summarily dispatched made it really hard for me to conserve them.  And that's <i>without</i> D ever getting a good to-hit roll when he tried to use Cleave, which (with its potential to take out two minions in a single shot) I'm convinced would have become his favorite attack if it had ever happened to land.  The lack of minions meant that even once the dragonshield warriors got some open field to maneuver in, there was no way for them to make anything happen.  Don't even talk to me about the poor kobold slinger.  It's not happy to be outranged (by, specifically, magic missile) and driven out of cover.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147162">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147162/#Comment_147162" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-01T17:49:53+00:00" title="June  1, 2008  5:49PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            About halfway through the battle, we turned over Mogue the rogue's character sheet.  "Sneak Attack" should <b>NOT</b> be on the second page of the sheet.  It is the rogue's primary ability, and the major factor that should inform his strategic use in the game.  I'm just sayin'.  D heard the phrase "Plus two d-eight" and his eyes got a misty, far-away look of delight on them.  "Two d-<b>EIGHT</b>," he said, with a mix between avarice and reverence.  Once that incentive was clearly in place, D immediately started using Mogue as more of a skirmisher than a line fighter.  He kept clear of unattached foes, keeping his mobility (and staying out of range of AoO zones) until he could trap some poor kobold between Pieter and Morn, at which point Mogue would drop down into a flanking box, and butcher his target.<br/>\n<br/>\nD was very into healing abilities.  I told him how to use Surges, and he popped one on Mogue (who had taken some early ambush hits), but he was much more entranced at the idea of Eric making an attack that <b>both</b> damaged the enemy and healed his friends.  That ability is a winner, I think, on purely emotional grounds.<br/>\n<br/>\nD <i>definitely</i> noticed the impact that AC makes.  Those Dragon-shield guys earned his respect.  Mind you, I was deliberately describing that they were using these giant scales from some sort of lizard to turn aside <i>swords and spears</i>, and I think that visual image caught in his brain.  Partway through the battle, he said "Oh!  Oh!  Daddy!  Those scales come from a DRAGON!  You know how I know?  Because, daddy, the name of this game is Dungeons and <i>DRAGONS</i>, see?  That's why they're so hard!"<br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all, we had a <i>terrific</i> time with it as a tactical war-game.  There was plenty of roleplaying, in the form of us bending the little lego-figs arms in order to swing swords and axes, and to bop opponents over the head.  There was some dialogue, in the form of "Gah!  Get away from me you little lizard thing!  I'll kill you!" on D's part and "GGRRHRHRR!  SSSSSS!   Glibble-glaggle ffft!  AAARGH!" on mine.  Naturally, with one person playing all five PCs, there wasn't very much in-team banter ... D isn't that schizophrenic.<br/>\n<br/>\nD was extremely interested to get to Winterhaven (which we had to put off in order to do dinner).  He was very insistent ... "Daddy, we <b>have</b> to go there!  We have to!  I don't even know what those things <i>were</i>, and if I find out what they are then maybe I can talk to them.  And what about my guys teacher?  He went to Winterhaven, and we have to find out what happened to him.  Daddy, can we do it now, pleeeeeeeasssssse?"<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, when I sat down with him to play Winterhaven, he immediately said "Hey?  Where's the map?"  I explained that some parts you just imagine.  "There's a little walled village," (I set up a shoe-box) "With some guards on the walls" (lego mini-figs) "and farmhouses here and there in the valley below the hill."<br/>\n<br/>\nThis did not satisfy him.  "But daddy, WHERE are the farmhouses?  I have to know.  How do I know if I can move to them, if I don't even know where they are?"<br/>\n<br/>\n"Sweetheart, this is just a village.  You probably won't have to fight here, and if we do then I'll make up a map on the spot."<br/>\n<br/>\n"No.  I need to know now.  It could be a monster village, daddy.  You.  Never.  Know."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147177/#Comment_147177" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-01T19:52:07+00:00" title="June  1, 2008  7:52PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man.

Hippie story gamers will think it's immensely important which ability they choose, to absolutely maximize their chances of victory.  D wants to win, but also when he wants to toss off a freakin' Scorching Burst, even though it's an area effect ability that's less effective against a single opponent ... so what?  He wants to SET A BAD GUY ON FIRE.  He does it.<br><br>And, y'know what?  It all works out.  That may be because we were dealing with the first (and, I strongly suspect, easiest) encounter ... but also, it looks like the game as a whole has a huge tolerance zone for suboptimal behavior.  It's easy to do something massively right, very hard to do something massively wrong.<br><br>That makes it very attractive to wade in, play the game a little, then go back and ponder the rules.  For instance, rereading the characters more closely tonight I discovered the Combat Challenge on the Fighter, and the Divine Challenge on the Paladin.  These abilities are composed of 50% Rock, 50% Win and 50% Awesome:  They let you defend your comrade by giving opponents penalties for attacking <i>anybody but you</i>.  "Don't you go lookin' funny at my wizard, sunshine, your fight is with ME."  And y'know what that incentivizes?  That gives your fighters an incentive to go after the biggest, baddest thing they can get their hands on, in order to keep it from the rest of the party.<br><br>I'm not sure I agree with Simon that this is the same game with slightly nicer packaging.  It feels ... different.  It doesn't really feel like a descendant of 2e or 3e at all.

I just remember that when 3.0 came out, I was very enthused, and didn't want to play anything else for a long time, until the same old problems crept in (mostly about Sim/Gam conflicts).

Even without the shift-as-minor-action, you can use your movement action to take a one-space shift back out of AoO range, then your standard action to charge across the field in order to engage someone else.<br><br>Originally, I was thinking "Man, that'd be imbalanced, because everyone would flee the fighters and munch on the mage."  You could still manage it by setting up overlapping tackle-zones (sorry, every time I think about AoO, I think about BloodBowl, the fantasy football game in which I first saw this mechanic), but it would be onerous, especially on an open field, and with so very much movement available.  BUT, all that worry was before I noticed the Challenge abilities, which in turn balance that tactic.  Paladins can't pin down <i>everyone</i> (though they can definitely make one guy stay with them), but fighters can keep up to <i>eight</i> enemies pinned, at least to the extent of smacking them on the ass on the way out if they try this tactic.  Combat Challenge is a heckuva thing.<br/><br/>EDIT:  And, BTW, I notice that charge is <i>specifically</i> worded so as to make flanking operations harder ... you can't corner-dance around someone to their rear, if you're charging:  You are required to come in on as direct a route as possible.  Flanking is still possible, but it's going to make tactics like shield walls (tight or loose) much more practicable.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147232/#Comment_147232" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-02T06:28:16+00:00" title="June  2, 2008  6:28AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 2, 2008 6:30AM by Valamir.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Haven't had a chance to play yet...but given the thought that went into this design (those promo pieces are awesome illustrations how the largest company in the biz approaches game design...I'd be really surprised if such obvious tactics like that weren't nailed down pretty tight.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit:  by "nailed down" I mean effectively balanced with trade offs.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course future material that comes out can easily throw all that to hell...designing the powers like CCG mechanics is likewise going to be vulnerable the same power bloat that CCGs suffer from in future releases...which is why I intend to stick entirely with WoTC material...and even then to limit myself to just the stuff that part of this same design cycle.

Take your full move, ending just as you move <b>into</b> the diagonal back corner of a front-line fighter.  Take your minor shift, moving past that fighter without provoking AoO.  CHARGE.  You get 13 spaces, past front-line fighters, and climb right up the wizards face.  Just one minion pulling that makes spellcasting a nightmare.<br/>\n<br/>\nMind you, people can counter by making sure that there are no one-space skips through their line.  Blood Bowl players know this drill:  It's the same thing you gotta do against Elf teams, with their Dodge-heavy tactics.  Nice to see I've got some tactics to import, though :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nD wants another combat before getting to Winterhaven, so I think I'm going to have Delphina Moongem be returning from the foothills, and beset by kobolds.  That'll elevate her from "flower-elf who shows up at the Market Square" to "That woman we rescued!" and simultaneously give me a good opportunity to feed D into more productive encounters in town ("Oh, you want to hear about Douven?  I think he was working with Eilian the Old ... Eilian will be at Wrafton's Inn right about now, would you like me to introduce you?")  You can bet that the new tactics are going to make an appearance.  Divine Challenge, for instance, is a <i>great</i> move for putting the rescue on people at a distance:  Choose whoever's most dangerous to the hostage, and put the challenge-smackdown on them ... that holds them off from profitably attacking (they can do it, but they take damage as an interrupt before launching their attack, which for a minion is all she wrote) and gives you another round to hopefully close the gap.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147264/#Comment_147264" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-02T08:46:43+00:00" title="June  2, 2008  8:46AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is pretty awesome that you and your kid had so much fun with it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will%20Grzanich" title="Will Grzanich"><img alt="Will Grzanich" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will%20Grzanich">Will Grzanich</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147275/#Comment_147275" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-02T09:35:42+00:00" title="June  2, 2008  9:35AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just wanted to say that I don't think <i>I</i> could have done such a good job picking out Lego figurines.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  Awesome all around.

I set up the road map, and he gleefully set out his minis.  Then I pulled out the little red-headed girl mini, and trotted her out of the forest.  "HELP!" she cried, "Somebody help me!"<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I started setting up kobolds.  Lots.  Of.  Kobolds.  Albeit, due to a lack of lego shields, most of them were minions, but it was still a nice sight.  D swung into action, laying down challenges (which we'd discussed earlier) to keep the front-runners away from the damsel in distress, and weaving Mogue through multiple attacks of opportunity to drop him dead center in the middle of the oncoming horde.  Not a smart move for Mogue personally, but his ability to force the kobolds to waste their free shift in getting around him meant that Morn (coming to Delphina's rescue) was able to act effectively to pin incoming units down with his <i>own</i> AoO field, following which he dropped the Divine Challenge constraints on them.  That kept Delphina upright, despite multiple kobolds going after her.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd also discovered that Morn and Mizard spoke Draconic, the same language as the kobolds, so this time through D got to hear some of their chatter:  "They are too strong!  Still, we <i>must</i> kill the girl ... she knows too much!"<br/>\n<br/>\nShortly after starting the whole rescue operation, D turned to me and said "Hey, Dad, if I rescue her will she come with us?  Maybe she's from Winterhaven.  She can help us find Douven Staul."  I allowed as how all of those things were possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter another couple of rounds of action, D turned to me.  "She's an elf girl, right?  Eric is going to fall in love with her."<br/>\n<br/>\nMinions fell in <i>droves</i>.  My new understanding of their maneuverability made for some tight moments for Mizard (he got jumped not once but <i>twice</i> by vaulting minions), but D was cool under pressure.  "Okay, I take a shift back.  Now I'm one square away from him, right?  Magic Missile."<br/>\n<br/>\nEric went to the rescue of Mogue:  Killed off the one minion who was holding down a flanking position on the rogue, then stepped into the gap.  Now they were a line ... much harder to flank.  Plus, of course, he used his Healing Strike, so Mogue was feeling better already.  But Mogue is definitely running the lowest on Surges of the party.  He seems a bit reckless.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point, it was Morn's turn.  The sling-kobold he was fighting didn't relish the thought of hand-to-hand, so backed off.  D asked me "Hey, if I move Morn will the girl-elf stay with him?"  I said "Well, what do you say to her?"  D brightened up.  "He says 'If you come with me, I'll take you to safety!' ", " ' OKAY! ' says the girl-elf, with obvious relief."  Morn made his way carefully across the battle-field, keeping between Delphina and any threats.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the dragon-shield guys I had got in contact with Pieter.  Oh, going into combat with Pieter is a mistake.  When he started out, it was a kobold dragon-shield warrior, plus four minions.  Two rounds later, it was just a dragon-shield warrior.  Shift away?  Take a hit.  He took the hit, to run back to the other dragon-shield warrior.  So now, suddenly, we've got two shield walls (Eric, Pieter and Mogue in a line parallel to the two dragon-shield warriors).  D grins, and moves Mogue <i>back</i>, then diagonally across a corner (using his bonusses to dodging AoO to dance through people's grasp like the acrobat he is) and around to the back of the shield line.  Suddenly <i>both</i> of the kobolds are flanked.  Plus, they're both in contact with Pieter.  Did I mention that kobolds don't <b>like</b> to be in contact with Pieter?  The one who'd already been mangled went down almost instantly, and the other one bought a Spinning Sweep that knocked him off his feet.  Getting up while surrounded by three adventurers proved not to be so possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe sling-kobold decided to hide in the woods for cover.  D laughed.  "Okay, it's Mizard's turn.  I move him around these rocks so that he can see the forest, and ... Scorching Burst."  "Oh NO!" I cried, "You set the kobold <b>and</b> the bushes he's hiding in on fire!  He runs out in terror!  His turn:  He's going to attack Mizard for setting him on fire."  <img alt="D:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/anguished.png" title="D:"/>  "Divine Challenge."  Me:  "Oh, right, so that's six more points and ... ouch.  He's dead.  Never even gets his shot off."  <img alt="D:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/anguished.png" title="D:"/>  "HeeeeheeeheeeEE!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147362/#Comment_147362" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-02T14:51:32+00:00" title="June  2, 2008  2:51PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At this point, D was very insistent:  It was time to get to Winterhaven.  I'd built some lego buildings on the floor of his bed-room, but D looked at it and immediately said "I think we should make a building up on the bed that would be like on a mountain, or a tower or something."  Well, since Winterhaven <i>has</i> a tower, I wasn't gonna complain about that.  D spent a while building a nice tower, and then building a big throne-like chair for the person who lived in the tower, then a big ladder leading up to the tower.  Then he was ready to enter Winterhaven.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith Delphina to attest to their heroics, the guys got much more than the standard "Hey, head over to Wrafton's Inn" welcome dictated by the tutorial.  They talked to the locals enough to find a lead on their vanished mentor, then D said "Well, we'll have to go rescue him ... but first, I want to talk to everyone in all the buildings we made."<br/>\n<br/>\nI described that the next building was a sort of staging area for warrior training.  "Oh, oh!" D said, "Are there dummies?  We can get some training dummies and show off our moves!"  "SURE!"<br/>\n<br/>\nSo he proceeded to show captain Rond, of the Winterhaven Regulars, every single move in their arsenal ... complete with tossing the lego mini-fig dummies around and sound effects.  Fun!  Rond, of course, suggested that they could use some good adventurers to get rid of the kobolds, if they could ever find their lair.  D said "Well, one of the things we can do is understand the kobolds when they talk.  They said they were going to kill Delphina because she knew too much."  "Me?  What do I know?  I just happened upon a group of them near the waterfall."  "That must be it!  They needed to kill you because the waterfall is their lair.  We know where they are now!"<br/>\n<br/>\nThings just clicked into place very easily.<br/>\n<br/>\nRond offered that Lord Padraig would no doubt reward them richly if they could get rid of the kobolds, but D said "Oh, you don't need to give us money.  I mean, you can if you want, but if you don't want to you don't have to.  We heard that our mentor Douven talked with Valthrun, though ... if we get rid of the kobolds, would he talk with us?  We just want help finding our teacher."<br/>\n<br/>\nRond was suitably impressed, so I had him climb the (rickety) ladder up to Valthrun's tower on the bed.  I had a little NPCs-only scene with the mini-figs.<br/>\n<br/>\nR:  "Some adventurers have come to rid us of the kobold problem."<br/>\nV:  "For a pretty price, I expect!  I know their type, money-grubbing opportunists who... "<br/>\nR:  "Actually, they don't want to get paid."<br/>\nV:  "....."<br/>\nR:  "Yeah, they said they just wanted help finding their teacher, and that we could keep our money."<br/>\nV:  "These are <i>adventurers</i>, you say?"<br/>\nR:  "Apparently."<br/>\nV:  "I have never heard of adventurers of this type."<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, suitably impressed, Valthrun came to meet them.  D quickly concluded that a creepy sage who lived in a rickety tower must know magic, and asked whether he could teach Mizard any new spells.  I checked the quick start book which referred me to ... the Players Handbook.  "Well," I improvised, "These spells are quite dangerous in the wrong hands.  Your words are noble, but I would desire noble deeds to put truth to them, before entrusting you with such magic.  Maybe after you deal with the kobolds, huh?"<br/>\n<br/>\nAt that point, we were all ready for a break.  D, however, had one more thing to deal with.  "This ladder," he says, "It seems like everyone has trouble getting up and down it.  I'm going to go get some more legos, and build Valthrun some stairs.  But first, I'm going to go send Mogue up the ladder, to ask him if he wants some stairs."  Valthrun agreed that stairs would be a vast improvement, and so D set about building them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not quite sure what to say about the way that the lego props are supporting player-driven world-building.  It was unexpected.  However, any earlier concerns that D's enjoyment of the game was going to be restricted solely to the battlemat seem to have proven unfounded.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147400/#Comment_147400" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-02T16:36:42+00:00" title="June  2, 2008  4:36PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 2, 2008 4:37PM by Kynn.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is <b>the best AP report I have ever read in my life</b>.<br><br>What did the kids at school think of his minis?

I'm thinking that we may need to box up his lego space-ships in order to make room on his craft-table for the town.  Luckily, the craft-table has an elevated area for Varthun's tower.  But, really, I'm sick of stepping around the town commons every time I go in to put away laundry.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you take, by this, that the town is expanding, you would be correct.  He made a library, and then he started wondering "Hey, where do all these people sleep?"  There are more buildings now.  I think that he's about hit the limits of town expansion, however:  He's running out of legos.  Once that happened, he took his adventuring group around to tell all of the mini-fig villagers that he was heading out to deal with the kobold menace at the waterfall.  The villagers were all grateful, and wished the adventurers the best of luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's a bit in the Shadowfell module where, when you've dealt with the kobolds, the villagers start calling your group "The Heroes of Winterhaven."  I'm pretty sure that this intangible reward will be worth more to D than all the +5 Holy Avengers and Staves of the Magi in the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey headed out and we went into our now <i>third</i> road encounter, since I'd added a second encounter on the way to Winterhaven.  It's the first with ambush rules as an important element ... and an ambush that people have been justly complaining is just about impossible to avoid, seeing as it's a DC 25 perception check, and only one member in the party has even a +5 bonus to ... well dayumn.  Mogue the Rogue just pulled a natural 20 on his perception check, which (with his +5) matches the DC.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo ... uh ... no ambush.  Kid has got the damnedest luck some times.  Mogue shouts a warning, everyone slides into place, and the kobolds realize their ambush is blown.  "GLLGGHSGHSSSSS!" they shout, and I start rolling for initiative.<br/>\n<br/>\n"What did they just say?" D asks.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh.  Right.  Two of his guys speak Draconic.  " 'Brothers, we are discovered!  But it matters not, for the humans will die beneath our swords! ' "<br/>\n<br/>\n"Okay.  How do I say, 'No, it is YOU who will die, and you will dig the grave that you are buried in!' in Draconic?"<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Blink, blink&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n"Uh, that's 'SSSHSSL-Glibble-HURGH-HSsssssss.' "<br/>\n<br/>\n"Okay ... 'SSssHssH-Bibble-ugh-fibble!' "<br/>\n<br/>\n"Sweetheart, you just asked them whether they had any blue mushrooms."<br/>\n<br/>\n"Wait, wait!  I'll try again!  'SSShsssl-bibble-urgh- uh ... what's next?"<br/>\n<br/>\n"HSssssss"<br/>\n<br/>\n"... HSssssss"<br/>\n<br/>\n"Perfect!"<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so it went.  When D was moving for a character who spoke Draconic, he made sure to trash-talk and mock them, always asking me how to actually <i>say it</i> in Draconic, and then doing so.  Since I was doing the lego-puppet thing, we had some fun little exchanges with mini-figs shaking around (in anger, or fright, or whatever) while we hissed incomprehensibly.  When he was moving for a character who didn't speak Draconic, he'd still ask me what things meant, but would not respond.  It was wierd and wonderful.<br/>\n<br/>\nI should have known that all this talking would lead to complications.  But first, the fight!  Oh how those kobolds could have benefitted from ambush.  That said, I do think we're both getting the hang of AoO zones, flanking and marking.  Our front lines crashed together pretty hard, with one dragon-shield guy in particular having rotten luck and being battered down and separated from his unit.  Sucks to be him.  Mogue the Rogue got around kobold lines and bore down on the spell-casting Wyrmpriest (a new unit for me to play with!)  Just when I thought I was going to get some good spellcasting out of this guy, D had Mogue use Positioning Strike, and slide the kobold <i>directly</i> into the front lines of the battle, placing him squarely in the strike-zones of multiple heavy-hitters (including, worst of all, the Fighter ... no free Shift away for you, little Wyrmy).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe damaged dragon-shield guy managed to get a flanking position that gave <i>all</i> of his front-line guys an advantage ... and D's front-line guys were both pinned in the flank and marked by other kobolds ... so not the ideal guys to turn around and slaughter this putz.  But divinity (by way of Eric the cleric) intervened, lancing down from above to surgically remove the one imperfection behind their lines.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut at least I managed to squirrel the skirmisher (another new unit!) behind PC lines and make Mizard the Wizard's role that of constantly fleeing, rather than offering combat support.<br/>\n<br/>\nOR SO I THOUGHT.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147990/#Comment_147990" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-04T07:32:46+00:00" title="June  4, 2008  7:32AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm sitting there feeling all clever.  I've got a lizard shield line that's shifted around, and Mizard has run to the far side of that, <i>way</i> away from his comrades.  The skirmisher is behind his own lines, feeling secure again, and chasing Mizard.  Oh, I'm so damn tricky.<br/>\n<br/>\n"I shift back one square and cast Burning Hands," says D.<br/>\n<br/>\n"Oh, okay," I say, then take a look at the board.  "Oh," I say.  "Oh ... dear.  So ... are you choosing this set of squares from here to here?"  "Does that burn all of the kobolds?"  "Yes."  "Does it burn any of my guys?"  "No."  "I think I'll do that."  "Okay.  Have you been moving out there to do that this whole time?"  "Huh?"  "Never mind.  Let's roll some to-hits."<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point it was very much all over but for the agonized draconic shouting.  But that, interestingly, is when things got really funny and wierd.<br/>\n<br/>\n"GGLgLGGGLGG!  SSSSSSSssss ss ss ..."  "What's that mean?"  "We are done for, my brother!  Let us die with honor!", I say.  After all ... they're toast.  Everyone knows it.  Quoth <img alt="D:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/anguished.png" title="D:"/>  "Do you surrender?"  &gt;Blink, blink&lt;  "Uhhhh ... SSS?"  "What's that mean?"  "Uhhhh ... yes?"<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now he's got two prisoners, and I'm all like "What the heck is he going to do with prisoners?  Is there going to be horrific torture involved?  Is he going to wring information out of them, then slaughter them?  Kids can be dark ... "<br/>\n<br/>\nQuoth <img alt="D:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/anguished.png" title="D:"/>  "Are you good now?"<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Blink, blink&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n"Uh ... I don't think we're really ... uh ... good <b>or</b> evil.  We're just sorta ... us."<br/>\n<br/>\n"Oh.  Well I've decided you're going to be good."<br/>\n<br/>\n"But that ... that doesn't actually make us good."<br/>\n<br/>\n"It will.  I believe in you."<br/>\n<br/>\nWow.  His major adventure-genre influences have been Fantastic Four, Naruto and Avatar ... but I didn't realize he'd actually been listening.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo he <i>took them back to Winterhaven.</i>  He said "You're going to live here now, and you're going to be good."  He spent all afternoon talking to extremely mistrustful villagers, convincing them to give these two guys a chance.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the interest of having chances to, y'know, fight (which D definitely agrees is a lot of fun) we established that he'd gotten lucky and captured the only two non-evil kobolds in the whole tribe, and that the rest of them were terribly evil right down to the core and needed to be killed with extreme death.  D listened to that and said "Yeah, because otherwise we'd have to rescue everybody, and I don't have enough legos for that."<br/>\n<br/>\nHe cannibalized some of the last of the legos and built a blacksmith (which the town is supposed to have anyway ... if he builds a temple I think we'll finally match the town in the scenario) so that he could make new, not-nasty-kobold weapons for Slllkot and Blag (the prisoners, of course).  So we pulled the grimy little lego minis off of them and put nice, shiny lego minis on them.  It's a good thing I'd gone out and gotten some troll and death-knight figures, or else they'd have looked human.  As it is, they look like monsters in shiny armor, which is a strangely disconcerting thing to look at.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the kobold refugees, D learned about how the goblins and the crazy human ("He's the guy on the cover," D said with certainty) had moved in and pushed the kobolds out of their previous homes near the haunted keep, and he learned about Irontooth.  He immediately started spinning future scenarios around Irontooth:  "When Irontooth finds out that you guys are here in the village, he's going to come here because he'll think you're on his side and that you'll help him kill these people and eat them, but when he tells you to do that, you tell him 'NO!' and you hit him right on the head!"<br/>\n<br/>\nI am no how, no way going to do anything to get in the way of a story that well set up.  Oh heck no.  He's got a formula in mind, and I have zip-point-zero problem with running it through to its completion.  When Irontooth is on his last legs, I'll do my level best to shift him free of the cave combat and have him make an escape.  Then I can use him (rather than the elf-spy who has never garnered any interest from D in Winterhaven) to do the whole "raising the dead of the graveyard" scene.  Slllkot and Blag, having volunteered to join the Winterhaven Regulars, will be front and center, defending their newfound home.  I'm thinking that Irontooth may have a philosophy about how monsters are monsters, and nothing can change that ... something to prompt him to mock and deride D's efforts to turn these kobolds into anything other than evil.  With a lot of help from D and his adventurers, I have great hopes that these kobolds will be able to strike the decisive blow that finally destroys the goblin who terrorized them for so long, and proves that they can become more than mere monsters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147996/#Comment_147996" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-04T07:47:36+00:00" title="June  4, 2008  7:47AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>Today I went out to the Lego outlet store that happens to be near me.<br><br>I did not go crazy-crazy, but I did spend close to $20.

He immediately started spinning future scenarios around Irontooth:  "When Irontooth finds out that you guys are here in the village, he's going to come here because he'll think you're on his side and that you'll help him kill these people and eat them, but when he tells you to do that, you tell him 'NO!' and you hit him right on the head!"<br><br>I am no how, no way going to do anything to get in the way of a story that well set up.  Oh heck no.  He's got a formula in mind, and I have zip-point-zero problem with running it through to its completion.  When Irontooth is on his last legs, I'll do my level best to shift him free of the cave combat and have him make an escape.  Then I can use him (rather than the elf-spy who has never garnered any interest from D in Winterhaven) to do the whole "raising the dead of the graveyard" scene.  Slllkot and Blag, having volunteered to join the Winterhaven Regulars, will be front and center, defending their newfound home.  I'm thinking that Irontooth may have a philosophy about how monsters are monsters, and nothing can change that ... something to prompt him to mock and deride D's efforts to turn these kobolds into anything other than evil.  With a lot of help from D and his adventurers, I have great hopes that these kobolds will be able to strike the decisive blow that finally destroys the goblin who terrorized them for so long, and proves that they can become more than mere monsters.</br></br></blockquote>\nAwe<br><br>some!                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148022/#Comment_148022" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-04T09:06:52+00:00" title="June  4, 2008  9:06AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>"It will.

Figure out what grooves them and turn up the volume to MAX POWER on those things.<br/><br/>I think about old D&amp;D campaigns I ran. I had a tendency to show up to the first session with a list of restrictions: You can't play this alignment, or these races, or this class. You should roll up your stats using this method that prevents you from having too many high stats. You can't have cool armor at this level. No, you can't have a wardog. You can't fight with two daggers unless you want a -7/-4 penalty or spend a bunch of feat slots to avoid it. This NPC is cooler than you are. And arrogant and snotty. <br/><br/>I'm starting a new campaign in a week. I'm super jazzed about it. I'm showing up with <i>nothing</i> but enthusiasm and creativity, my rule books and dice. I'm curbing my burning desire to start building a world. I'll let the players tell me what they want to do first. If they all want to play half-angel heroes who walk the earth telling the mortals what they should do, we'll do that. If they want to play miniature dragonfly fairies who cause trouble in villages, we'll do that. I will ask them how they want to create their characters, not tell them. I will ask them how they want to run the game, not tell them. I will take their ideas -- even their questionable suggestions -- and use them to make the game unforgettable.

I am intensely against the notion of fudging games in order to help D win, since I think it teaches <i>terrible</i> skills for later life.  At the same time, he had <b>so</b> much emotionally invested in this ... and I've heard all manner of rumblings online about how Irontooth has a tendency to kill and eat entire parties.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd looked over the scenario, and I saw the <i>very real</i> possibility of this happening:  The encounter is set up in three layers.  If you hit the first layer outside the waterfall in a tentative fashion, they'll retreat through the water and then you're dealing with a second layer that's almost twice as powerful  God help you if you let that second layer survive intact long enough for the third layer to support it.  The concentration of force gives Irontooth the support to rampage unstoppably ... and PCs have no good places to retreat to, with their back against a raging torrent of water.  This looked like something that could easily turn into a meatgrinder.  Was I going to walk D right into heartbreak at the mercy of the lego-monsters?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs it turned out, I was worrying needlessly.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen D got to the waterfall, I started setting out figures immediately.  He noted this change from previous kobold ambushes on the road.  "When do I put my figures down?" he asked.  "Well," I said, "This time you aren't being surprised.  In fact, this time they don't even know you're coming."  "Oh!" D said immediately, "I get to be SNEAKY!"<br/>\n<br/>\nSo he asked about the stealth rules, and I confirmed that he would be only as stealthy as the least stealthy person he sent in.  Mogue the Rogue went in scouting.  He crept around, and I filled in the rest of the units on the map.  Once D was sure that he knew where everyone (at least out front of the waterfall) was, he moved his other heroes into position in a nearby grove of trees.<br/>\n<br/>\n"Now, D," I said, "There are more kobolds, and Irontooth, behind the waterfall.  These guys will probably try to go through and warn their friends."  "Sure," D said without concern, "They'll <b>try</b>."<br/>\n<br/>\nSo he's all ensconced.  What does he do?  He starts looking over the situation.  "That's a magic circle.  Do kobolds know how to do magic like that?  Hrm.  I don't know.  There aren't any magician kobolds out here.  I bet they don't know how it works.  Daddy, I'm casting Scorching Burst right on the edge of that circle, to make it look like it just exploded."<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Would</i> kobolds know whether Scorching Burst came from the bushes or from the circle?  I have no rules to say one way or t'other, so I say "They're shocked!  'What that?' they cry, looking around in complete confusion."<br/>\n<br/>\n"I want to use Ghost Sound," D says, turning over his paper to show the cantrip that Mizard the Wizard has on hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis, my friends, was the beginning of the end for the overmatched kobolds.<br/>\n<br/>\nD used Ghost Sound to sow dissent among their ranks.  He'd have made Gandalf proud.  They were attacking each other, mistaking Mogue's sniper attacks for bow-shot from their allies, just all manner of confusion.<br/>\n<br/>\nRather than the orderly tactics suggested by their initial layout (and the battle-plan laid out in the booklet), the kobolds were in disarray when D finally had his guys come tearing out of hiding, in two directions.  One fast, mobile group laid the smack down on everyone within spitting distance of the waterfall while the heavy hitters swept down the middle and separated the initial force of minions from their reinforcements.  Then the two PC forces converged through the isolated center.  Every kobold died.  Nobody got anywhere <i>near</i> raising a warning.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was also the point where I realized D had become better at the grand flow of the game than I am.  He still has issues with details, so that he needs help <i>executing</i> the visions in his head, but his vision of battles is keen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148657">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148657/#Comment_148657" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-06T17:36:31+00:00" title="June  6, 2008  5:36PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            D sent Mogue to swim stealthily under the water, poke just the bare top of his head up, and survey the situation.  Lots of kobolds, spread loosely and effectively through a large cavern complex.  That second layer doesn't have a huge amount of raw power, but there are a <b>lot</b> of minions, and they do a very good job of both being speed bumps, and providing flanking support.<br/>\n<br/>\nD started thinking hard.<br/>\n<br/>\n"Irontooth is way back there, right?" he said.  "Yep."  "And he'll come out  to see what's happening if somebody gives a warning, right?"  "Yep.  You don't want that," I said, with great seriousness.  "Oh yes I <b>do</b>, daddy."<br/>\n<br/>\nD then proceeded to use Ghost sound to raise several false alerts.  The kobolds, of course, said "No, no, it wasn't <b>us</b>, it was mysterious voices from the air!"  Irontooth was not convinced and <i>not pleased</i>.  Eventually he said "You guys are lucky I don't kill every last one of you!" (though he had, in deference to evil overlords everywhere, killed <i>one</i> minion who brought him bad news)  "The next time you shout for help, you can just shout until your lungs fall out!"<br/>\n<br/>\nThis actually didn't change the scenario that's published, but it did make it <i>make sense</i>.  The third wave is supposed to dilly-dally for three combat rounds before joining the second wave.  I'd been sort of wondering why, when they hear a great big sound of battle from out front, they don't come running on round one.  I understood how it made for a good tactical encounter, but it seemed a bit out of character.  Now, however, it made perfect sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, the kobolds out front are <i>freaked the heck out</i>.  Every time something new happened, a few more of the outlying minions came 'round to try to find out what the heck was going on.  Now, instead of being scattered throughout the cavern complex, they were all huddled in the main room, trying to figure out what to do next.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey "elected" one of their number to go through the waterfall and see what was going on.  Naturally, he didn't come back.  Finally, one of the skirmishers thought to go out one of the little side doors, spotted the adventurers and came running back in.  "We're under attack!" he yelled.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was the point when Mizard stepped through the water and cut loose with Burning Hands.  With the minions clustered in fearful little knots, it had the potential to be an utterly devestating blow.  Sadly, D had absolutely rotten dice luck, and so only took out five at a single blow.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kobold commander (clearly a clever one) tried to rally the troops.  "It's ten of us against one of him!" he cried.  "No matter how tough he is, we can take him!"<br/>\n<br/>\nCue Mogue coming in through an unguarded entrance, to cut them off from retreat, as well as take a devestating sneak attack.  "Okay, it's nine of us, against two of them!"<br/>\n<br/>\n"Eight of us against three of them."<br/>\n<br/>\n"Well, there's six of us, and only four of them!"<br/>\n<br/>\n"Okay, there's four of us, and ... uh ... five of them."<br/>\n"Boss, I don't know my numbers so good, but ... are we winning?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_148658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148658/#Comment_148658" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-06T17:37:49+00:00" title="June  6, 2008  5:37PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So here's the thing:  From the point where adventurers attack the second layer of kobold defense, you're supposed to count three rounds, then unleash the third layer.  Whatever is left gets to provide cannon-fodder to support Irontooth and his cavalry.  Between the early, strategic use of Burning Hands, and the flanking maneuvers from Mogue, by the end of the second round there were no living kobolds left from the second layer.  What the heck am I supposed to do <i>then</i>?  Ask the adventurers to sit down, peruse the magazines, and wait for the doctor to be ready to see them?<br/>\n<br/>\nHappily, D solved this problem for me.  He called out the kobolds of the third layer (though not Irontooth) and challenged them to come help their comrades.  'course, there were no comrades left by the time they got there, but that's cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo they've got two dragon-shields and a wyrmpriest tearing down toward the little entry-way to the big room.  This is pretty much the same force as the <i>entire previous road encounter</i>.  It's a lot of kobold muscle.  I'm thinking in terms of "That's a <b>lot</b> of hit points!  He's not going to make much of a dent in them in just one round."  D, on the other hand, isn't worried about killing them:  He's thinking about how to make them <i>not important in the combat</i>.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe parks Pieter the fighter in that little entry-way.  Just Pieter.  But Pieter is the brick wall.  <i>Nothing</i> gets past him, and in this entry-way the kobolds would have to take three successive attacks from him in order to squirrel their way past to the rest of the party.  Mizard and Eric sit two squares back from Pieter, and plunk spells into the Wyrmpriest, while Morn and Mogue set themselves up at the other entry-way ... the entry-way that Irontooth has to come through.<br/>\n<br/>\nThroughout the combat that followed, I kept thinking that I'd be able to take Pieter down.  Man, I was so, so, so wrong.  Maybe if I'd tired him out more consistently in the encounters leading up to this ... maybe.  But as it was, he came in with 10 healing surges still in his inventory, and between his fighter ability to spend surges for a minor action, and Eric's healing word ability, he spent something like seven of them during the course of his one man stand.  He was unbreakable.<br/>\n<br/>\nSide-note:  This whole cavern combat finally and completely sold me on 4e as a combat system that creates the patterns of fantasy-action combat.  It's not as simple as cause-and-effect:  There's no one thing you can point at and say "The fighter has the "Block entryway" ability, which can be used to block an entryway," but the elements that are there combine in ways that create the right patterns.  Heroic actions are the <i>winning strategy</i> in a way that is rare in wargames.  It's very easy to start from what makes sense, and then try to <i>add on</i> heroism ... but it gets swamped by the foundation of good sense:  Yes, you can get a bonus to running into the middle of a group of enemies, but if the bonus only partly offsets the cause-and-effect penalties of running into those enemies, you won't do it.  In 4e, they've balanced it so that the sensible "Don't be stupid" elements are there, and they're important, but the heroism is enough <i>more</i> important that it makes sense to do the valiant thing, even if people would say "Nobody could possibly survive that!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148660/#Comment_148660" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-06T17:38:46+00:00" title="June  6, 2008  5:38PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Where was I?  Ah yes!  At last, Irontooth!  As the monster comes tearing down the corridor, I warned D "I gotta tell you, people on the internet have been saying that a lot of the time Irontooth kills their <i>whole party</i>, no matter what they try to do to stop him."<br/>\n<br/>\nD levelled a grave look at me.  "Well, daddy," he said, "We'll just see what the case is with ME."<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay then.  Time for me to stop worrying, and bring the thunder.  Or ... something.<br/>\n<br/>\nI liked Pieter's idea.  I had a nice little doorway of my own, and Morn and Mogue were standing close to it.  I set Irontooth up right in that enclosed passage, and roared defiance.  "Come and get me!"<br/>\n<br/>\nD had Morn engage the front, then had Mogue scurry his way under an attack of opportunity, to take Irontooth's flank:  Then he cut loose with Positioning strike.  Got a hit, and slid Irontooth three squares right out of the doorway and into the waiting center of the big open room, with adventurers already arranged in a loose circle around the walls, facing inwards.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was <b>not</b> where I would have preferred to have my giant bad guy.  I knew immediately that it was time to move him.<br/>\n<br/>\n"If I draw water from the waterfall, like waterbending, will that make ray of frost more powerful?" D wondered.  "Uh ... sure!" I said, figuring that I didn't need to layer any new mechanical effects on, we could just say "It's more powerful!" as color.  But I will say that Ray of Frost was exactly the spell I needed to not have cast right then.  I needed Irontooth to MOVE!  Boom, he's iced to the ground, slowed to a crawl.  Oy.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point, Eric and Mizard left Pieter to his own devices (still facing three major-league kobolds) and joined the "Squash Irontooth" party.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was when fortune reared its ugly head.  Suddenly, D was rolling all single digit numbers ... <i>low</i> single digit numbers, like 3 and 4.  Mogue's once-a-day Trick Strike (which would have been <i>beyond awesome</i> if it had landed, letting him shove Irontooth around the board for the rest of the encounter) whiffed, as did several flanking attacks.  PCs started taking really serious damage from Irontooth's axe.  Pieter got hit three for three one round, and came within three points of dropping in his tracks.<br/>\n<br/>\nD looked carefully at the twenty-sided die.  "Okay," he said, "This die hates me."<br/>\n<br/>\n(Note:  He's watching me write this right now ... his commentary:  "It <b>does</b> hate me!  It does, it does it does!")<br/>\n<br/>\nSays I "Well, honey, sometimes you have a run of bad luck.  There's really not much you can do about it."<br/>\n<br/>\n"Sure there is," he said, "You roll for me."<br/>\n<br/>\n"Uh ... it doesn't actually ..."<br/>\n<br/>\n"Pleeeeeeeaassse???"<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I rolled Morn's Divine Judgment, hitting solidly with an 18 (which gave them the ability to heal Pieter back up to fighting trim.  And I rolled Eric's Beacon of Hope, getting a 16 ... and <i>halving</i> Irontooth's damage just as he entered the deadly "Berserker" zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, okay ... the die hated him.  It happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight about this point, I asked D "Hey ... if you get close to defeating Irontooth, do you want to defeat him here, or do you want him to escape, so that you can fight him near Winterhaven, where Sllllkot and Blag could confront him?"<br/>\n<br/>\nD looked at me like I'd said ... well, something singularly stupid.  "I want to kill him here, dad.  That's what we came to do."<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, that's cool!  So we proceed with the killing:  Once Irontooth was berserk, I played it up, with the incohate growling and the veins standing out, and the slobbering and stuff.  "He's not even thinking," I said, "All he wants to do is KILL KILL KILL!"<br/>\n<br/>\n"Oh yeah?" D replied, "Well all he's <i>going</i> to do is DIE DIE DIE!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_148661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148661/#Comment_148661" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-06T17:39:14+00:00" title="June  6, 2008  5:39PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But there was something not quite right.  D started asking me strange questions:  "Do I have a magic cell-phone power?"  "No."  "Can I use Ghost Sounds all the way to Winterhaven?"  "Uh ... no ... it's out of range."  "How far is it?"  "Hundred's of spaces."  "HOW MANY?"  "Uh ... eight hundred."  "Oh MAN."<br/>\n<br/>\nI am, occasionally, a clever daddy.  I said "Hold on, I'll be right back," and ran down to the bedroom and Winterhaven.  I came back clutching two mini-figures.  "Okay!  Sllllkot and Blag come running through the waterfall!  'We know you is fighting for us!  We scared, but we not let you fight alone!' "<br/>\n<br/>\n"YAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYY!", says D.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we had the moral symbolism of Slllkot and Blag facing down Irontooth after all ... and, plus, Irontooth was at his most deliberately monstrous and inhuman.  Irontooth scoffed at the adventurer's claims that the kobolds were good, and told the little lizard-guys to attack the adventurers.  The kobolds said "NO!" and moved forward to bonk him onna head.  Sllllkot got one hit in (a hit from the kobolds was absolutely required), after which D told them "Hey!  You guys have an important job!  Go back into that room, and gather up all the treasure.  We'll take it from here!<br/>\n<br/>\nA brief digression, back in time:  While I was setting up mini-figs on the cave map, D spotted the huge pile of treasure printed on the map.  His eyes got very big.  "Wow," he said, "That's a lot of treasure!"  I nodded, knowingly:  Well did I remember the intoxicating allure of imagined riches.  I wasn't quite sure what he could buy with all that in this system, but I figured something would suggest itself.<br/>\n<br/>\n"The people of Winterhaven sure will be glad to get that all back!" D continued.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd when he sent Slllkot to get the treasure, D suddenly yelped "I'll be right back!" and ran downstairs.  He cannibalized (I think) one of his deep sea lego sets, and came back up holding a mini-fig treasure chest with a closing top.  "Let's see if he can open it!"  Sllllkot managed his thievery roll, and we opened the chest to reveal a tiny pile of lego gold pieces and jewels.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids are awesome.<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to the fight!<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd made a point of how Irontooth was no longer thinking, just acting on brute animal savagery ... and how that made him stronger (as witness the extra 1d10 of damage).  D disagreed:  "He <i>thinks</i> that makes him strong, but we're a team, and we work together, and that makes us stronger than he could ever be."  Go Fantastic Four and Naruto!<br/>\n<br/>\nHis intuition was right on the money, too:  Irontooth was fixated on the nearest target.  D made sure that Morn (with his massive hit points and AC20) was always the one closest one to Irontooth when the monster's turn came up.  But, in the meantime, Mogue kept dropping in and out for devestating flanking attacks, Mizard kept dropping magic missiles, Eric was delivering the smiting of the gods ... and all of them from a nice, safe distance.  It looked pretty much like the <i>Fellowship</i> scene in Moria, with the Cave Troll, thrashing around trying to get a bead on constantly shifting attackers.   I never did get to use Irontooth's double-attack:  He never had two people adjacent to him, except for moments of pain.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother factor that I think contributed to Irontooth's demise:  Daily powers.  D had saved every last one of these.  He used every last one in this climactic battle.  Man, those powers are a big deal.  Here's an example:<br/>\n<br/>\nPieter, bleeding and battered, was nonetheless whittling down his opposition with no more help from anyone.  He dropped the Wyrmpriest.  He managed to chew through the hitpoints of one Dragonshield guy.  But there was one guy who had taken only three hit points of damage (from a cleave) and still had 33 left.  Oy.<br/>\n<br/>\nD turned to me (as Pieter) and said "Look, my friends need my help, so I dont have time for you.  Sorry.  Brutal Strike."  This daily power does 6d6+3, and rolled as follows:  6, 5, 5, 6, 4, 4.  Plus 3, remember:  33 points exactly.  BAM!  Smashed the guys helmet right down to his boots, in one massive strike.  Satisfying!<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's another example:  When Irontooth was down to a mere fifteen hit points, one by one, all of the people near him moved back to a respectful distance.  Mizard stepped up.  "Acid Arrow, daddy," D said intensely.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelted the creep right down to sludge, leaving only the dwarven armor and a funny obsidian necklace.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148662/#Comment_148662" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-06T17:41:57+00:00" title="June  6, 2008  5:41PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But, of course, that was not the end!

Just freakin'. . .<b>WOW.</b><br><br>Things I love about this: First, the unbridled fun of everything. The kid's freakin' into it. Everything from straight-up kickin' ass, to world tinkering/setting contribution, to creative roleplaying decisions like<i> offering Kobolds surrender and taking them to rehabilitate and live in town(!)</i> He dives into everything full-force, and frequently shows up his dad (no offense!). Awesome.<br><br>Second, The pure play aspect of using Legos. It seems to inform everything about the game, from gesticulating with the figures and tearing them apart when they're killed, to defining the environment and encouraging contributions to it. The kid's freaking building the village that his heroes visit. He seems to insist on fleshing it out and representing all the physical aspects of it, just for the sheer joy of it.<br><br>Third, the tactical goodness of the game, offering plenty of nuance yet easily exploitable by a 7 year old. One thing to note is that this particular adventure product is geared for introduction (the full game ain't even out just yet), so it goes a little easy at first, then ramps up. But anyway, in contrast to most blow-by-blow RPG battle descriptions, this account grabs and excites me (just like the man in the park. . .) with its rollicking fun action and cinematic flair. The give and take of the melee as a true ring to it, even reminding me of some SCA battles I've observed, with all its shield walls and flanking maneuvers and such--without falling into a trap of "realism" or whatever at the expense of fun. Seems like a great game for swashbuckling, or swords and sorcery, or Indy Jones-ish brawling, type set-piece battles, with all it's shuffling around and jockeying for advantage. And it seems like all that square-counting and power-selecting doesn't bog down game flow much at all. Very cool. Also worth noting (which you did!) is that monsters seem to come in a ton of varieties now, so you can pile on Kobold Minions and Kobold Skirmishers and Kobold Dragonshields, and so forth without having to add in Orcs and Owlbears and Gnolls 'cause the Kobolds are getting old. And the Kobolds specifically seem well engineered to be slippery little bastards that swarm all over you and squeeze by your defenses. Nice.<br><br>I've been pretty ambivalent about D&amp;D 4th so far, but now I'm itching to at least try it. Looks like a lot of goodness packed in there if you approach it right ("right" meaning "in a way I enjoy"). Rock on!<br><br>Peace,<br>-Joel<br><br>PS: My friends, we live in a world where a man can purchase a Lego Colonial Marine's Pulse Rifle.

But these aren't Opportunity attacks:  Combat Challenge says "Whenever an enemy that is adjacent to you shifts or makes an attack that does not include you, you can make a melee basic attack against that enemy as an immediate interrupt."  That <i>looks</i> like an opportunity attack against shifts, but it doesn't have the same per-turn limitation.  Combine that with some back-stopping guys to cover people who <i>don't</i> shift, and you get the brick-wall fighter formation.<br><br>So if the bad guys use Koboldic triple-shifting (attack traded for movement, plus movement, plus minor) to try to clear the zone, they get whack-a-moled.  They would actually be better off (just against Pieter) using non-shifting movement to get by, except that <b>then</b> they'd be taking attacks of opportunity from Eric and Mizard as they entered yet more AoO zones.  I think they might have gotten away with a better equation once the spell-casters closed in on Irontooth, but at the time I evaluated it, there was no way to get through that didn't expose them to at least three attacks.<br><br>I'm really starting to love the strategies that can be assembled from the various feats in combination.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148738">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148738/#Comment_148738" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-07T10:43:25+00:00" title="June  7, 2008 10:43AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Not trying to imply that you're playing wrong, by the way; I'm just discussing what the rules as written say. It's insane how long we've spent already finangling the stealth rules here, for instance.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been told that the Combat Challenge is written wrong in those premade characters; that's what my brother Markku told me when we played Shadowfell a couple of weeks ago, anyway. That effect is only supposed to affect enemies marked by the fighter, not any enemy that shifts near him. Of course there's no way to know that without the rulebooks, which have started to trickle this week around the world, I understand.<br/>\n<br/>\nFurthermore, you can only take one "immediate" action per round. I learned this by meditating upon the Dragonshields in Shadowfell - if you could take however many immediate actions you wanted, then nobody could ever close upon a Dragonshield, who would just keep shifting away. (Markku also confirmed this for me, and I might have seen it in the lite rules that came with Shadowfell as well.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThus the fighter can take one opportunity attack and one immediate interrupt attack during a round (between two of his own turns, that is), with the latter only upon an enemy that he's marked. So I fear that while it'd certainly be cool if a character could effectively block a route, it's not actually possible unless the route is specifically one square wide. (Or the enemies so few and weak that they are deterred by two extra attacks.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy younger brother Jari has been leafing through the rulebook, and at least he's complaining that the rules are dull and castrated, with little opportunity for game-breaking combos or other tomfoolery. Jari is an old MtG player and only occasional roleplayer, so his viewpoint might be a bit skewed - I understand that many people would be delighted to hear that the new D&amp;D; rules actually do not allot significant extra efficiency to well-built characters as compared to thematically built ones.

That effect is only supposed to affect enemies marked by the fighter, not any enemy that shifts near him. Of course there's no way to know that without the rulebooks, which have started to trickle this week around the world, I understand.</blockquote>\nThat's correct. PHB p. 76.<br>Of course, that important restriction is missing in KotS.\n<blockquote>Furthermore, you can only take one "immediate" action per round. I learned this by meditating upon the Dragonshields in Shadowfell - if you could take however many immediate actions you wanted, then nobody could ever close upon a Dragonshield, who would just keep shifting away. (Markku also confirmed this for me, and I might have seen it in the lite rules that came with Shadowfell as well.)</blockquote>\nThat's correct. KotS p. 9.\n<blockquote>Thus the fighter can take one opportunity attack and one immediate interrupt attack during a round (between two of his own turns, that is), with the latter only upon an enemy that he's marked.</blockquote>\nThat's not correct. Characters get one OA per turn, not per round. A turn is, when a specific character acts. A round is over, when all characters had their turn. So you can hit each opponent once.<br><br>Again KotS p. 9.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148770/#Comment_148770" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-07T16:37:53+00:00" title="June  7, 2008  4:37PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That last point is sure to come up a lot, and I just confirmed it from the PHB myself.

This makes me want to change how I play. And Every time something happens in my campaign I'll be thinking WWDD. What Would D Do?<br>\n<br>\nFinally, My Girlfriend (23) is not a gamer but is playing D&amp;D and is enjoying it. We play with my brother (26) and sister (30). I'm 33.<br>\nShe approaches the game with the same new wonder as D, but I DM with the experience of 21 years of hard fought Gaming. I'll be changing my style this Friday night and every Friday after.<br>\n<br>\n5. This thread made me weep. I try to be a big kid and have fun in life, but stupid logic and grown-upness gets in the way. Your son should be an inspiration to us all. Please tell him from my Girlfriend and I how special he is and we thank you both for sharing.<br>\n<br>\nFourth, She wants a dragon friend. She says she was raised by dragons. She wants an ally or companion or something. Up until now, I couldn't find a way to give her a dragon that didn't change the game or make her super-powerful or out-shine the others. I finally decided, based on this story, to say Yes. Then decide how.<br>\nMy solution, change one of her Encounter powers, she has 2, into a dragon power. That dragon gives her Combat Advantage and she can make a basic attack. I've read all the Level 1 Encounter powers and it seems perfectly balanced. So instead of saying no it isn't in the rules, I said yes and here's how. I honestly wouldn't have done that with out this thread for inspiration.<br>\n<br>\nLast, She's named her dragon, D.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149012/#Comment_149012" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-09T10:31:52+00:00" title="June  9, 2008 10:31AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Clinton</cite>Same here!

Just want full disclosure on that, because it clearly <i>did</i> make at least some impact on how easy or hard of a time D had on the encounter.

He won because he had more imagination.  <br><br>A seemingly off-topic-but-not-really anecdote: we've been playing some Basic D&amp;D lately--the game from the early 80's--and it's unreal how deadly that game is.  Basic D&amp;D, like 4e, is pretty much nothing but a combat system, and you might naively think that's all there is to the game.  But the <i>real</i> game in Basic D&amp;D is to be so clever that you always fight on your terms, or never have to fight at all.  There aren't any rules for this; you've just got to <i>imagine</i> better.  From our comparative experiences, it sounds like this aspect of Dungeons &amp; Dragons is still alive and kicking in 4e.  That's wonderful and really brings a smile to my face.  For all the fancy moves of the new combat system, you shouldn't get so complacent that you stop <i>thinking</i>.<br><br>I've been reading a bunch of message boards where all these die-hard 3e people are harshing on 4e, and are saying things like, "This encounter is too hard!  This monster has too many hit points!  Mike Mearls is a lazy idiot who can't do math!  Waaaahh waaaaah waaaaaahh!"  Buddy, maybe your fancy Excel spreadsheet is a liability; maybe you've got to think like a 7 year old goin' hogwild in a fantasy world made out of Lego's.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ThatOneGuy" title="ThatOneGuy"><img alt="ThatOneGuy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ThatOneGuy">ThatOneGuy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149146/#Comment_149146" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-09T17:29:30+00:00" title="June  9, 2008  5:29PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tony, thank you so much for posting this.

You have inspired me to start looking into Legos for use as gaming minis.  I see that they offer a "battlepack" for knights and one for skeletons, that each include 5 minifigs and assorted accessories... any suggestions for other affordable sets?  I would like to get some of the dwarves/wizards, and I really like the trolls, especially the over-sized ones, that are part of the Castle sets, but they don't come as standalone minifig packs.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, what do you plan on using for your 'battlemat' for the dungeon itself?  The maps provided with the adventure only cover the last two rooms of the dungeon.<br/>\n<br/>\nLook forward to hearing about the rest of the adventure.  Make sure you take lots of pictures!<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153133/#Comment_153133" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-26T10:18:01+00:00" title="June 26, 2008 10:18AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I intend to use a battlemat for the dungeon.  Picked one up at my FLGS ... now I just need to get some water-soluble markers in a rainbow of colors.<br/>\n<br/>\nSkeletons are available as bulk-piece purchases at Lego.com, but other than that you're <i>straight</i> out of luck on getting minifigs at a decent price.  I recommend the Dwarven Catapult set, if you can find somewhere selling it ... two orcs (oh, I mean <i>trolls</i>), a dwarf and armor and weaponry for all three ... oh, and a catapult, if you're into that kind of thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently, D has been improvising stories in and around Winterhaven, pretty much to the exclusion of battles, or exploring the Keep.  Occasionally he tosses questions to me ("We go back to the dragon's tomb, and there's a village of magicans (sic) there, so we can make a light-saber ... now what kind of magicans are they, daddy?") and I keep my role as supporting-actor-in-chief ... but I definitely get the impression that D does not see the ghostly outlines of my GM viking hat.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've been informed that this afternoon a big goblin with 200 hit points is going to fight a ninja out front of the Winterhaven gate, and that the ninja will have little lego nunchaku.

Okay.  After they made a light-saber, and brought back some people from the fallen Nerath Empire, through a time-warp caused by the increasing spiritual instability in the area, D decided that his group needed a Ninja, and so he made a ninja mini-fig and had him show up.  At first, the ninja fought with the group (because, as D says, "That's what <i>happens</i>, daddy") but once the confusion ("We're not bad guys, we're good guys ... oh, I thought you were bad guys!  I was wrong") got cleared up, the ninja joined their group.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I found intriguing (and, I'll admit, a little frustrating) about this was that D required my <i>presence</i> as audience to validate the results of all this, but since he was playing both the ninja and his own group, there was no role for me to play.  I couldn't even, really, adjudicate ... because he knew the rules well enough to run his little mini-fight (and, really, it was mostly just the fun of using lego mini-figs to beat on other mini-figs ... he rolled a few dice, then said "And now he makes an attack that doesn't even need dice!  HAIYAH!")  So I was watching, which was tremendously fun for the first half hour or so, but ... oy.  If even my son's infectious joy can't keep this stuff interesting over the long haul, I'm pretty convinced that roleplaying is not a spectator sport.  And it couldn't, and it isn't.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did, however, get to name the ninja (because I know all the best japanese sounding names).  I named him Ichigo.  Yes, I know what it means :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSooooo ... now that the group has headed off to attack the Keep, I could use a little help:  Anyone who has the PHB want to stat me out a second level ninja?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155668">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155668/#Comment_155668" name="Item_114" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-09T11:48:33+00:00" title="July  9, 2008 11:48AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm...

Thank you and D.<br>-----<br>For your LEGO fixes, have you checked out <a href="http://us.factory.lego.com/pab/" rel="nofollow">Lego Pick-A-Brick</a>--seems like you have, from your mention of skeleton components? It's probably the cheapest way to accumulate new mini-fig bits, though they don't have every possible bit. But you can build a basic fig, with a hat and an accessory, for ~$1.25, with ~15\xa2 to ~50\xa2 per additional accessory. Frex, I just slapped together a mini-fig with breast plate, crossbow, and (lame-ish) rounded helmet for $1.38. Those battle packs come with a FEW more goodies than that, at the $13.00 price point for 5 mini-figs; but I think that's overall a bad deal; and you can likely do fine with fewer accessories in the long run (i.e. reuse).<br><br>I'll also second Brick Forge for really cool, varied accessories and figs. They ain't cheap, but if you just MUST have X, Y, and Z for your main PC (or main villain), they probably have it and then-some.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tobiasopdenbrouw" title="tobiasopdenbrouw"><img alt="tobiasopdenbrouw" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tobiasopdenbrouw">tobiasopdenbrouw</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155694/#Comment_155694" name="Item_115" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-09T14:03:04+00:00" title="July  9, 2008  2:03PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A second-level ninja = a second level rogue?
