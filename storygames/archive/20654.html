This was their first experience playing any kind of TTRPG, and they definitely enjoyed it. After we finished Summer, my roommate mentioned to me that he thought (based off the description I gave them initially) that TQY involved creating the world, and afterwards exploring it as characters. It's not quite what TQY is all about, but I thought it sounded like a great idea, and I've been on the hunt for a proper, relatively-rules-lite system ever since.<br/><br/>I think I'm running with Apocalypse World. I was initially hesitant, because one of my players is extremely math-averse, but the arithmetic in AW is pretty gentle, TQY has an implicit-though-unseen apocalyptic event as its finale, and the classes seem like they might slot in well with the dangerous, weird-fantasy world we ended up making in TQY.<br/><br/>Have any of you tried something like this, where you explore a world through multiple systems, or create a world with one system and use it as your setting in others?<br/><br/>If you can think of a better system (or PbtA hack) for the setting, I'd love any suggestions. Quick description: our community was clustered around the one remaining tower of a ruined castle. Our abundance was lore, which manifested as our relationship with the nearby forest; it demanded absolute nonviolence in exchange for its mystic protection (we assume this is how we bested the Jackals). The other tower lay torn in two in the lava pools a day's ride away from town, which we think held most of our history. By the end of the game, a suicide cult (about half the town) pacified the forest semi-permanently with their lives, a small crew of mechanized soldiers could be seen emerging from the east, we were in peace talks with the Jackals, an earthquake made a rift through the main path in town, and a dead sea serpent had poisoned the water supply.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453465/#Comment_453465" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-22T07:43:50+00:00" title="May 22, 2016  7:43AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 22, 2016 8:21AM by 2097.">edited May 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can change Apocalypse World to not be so numbers-focused like this:<br/>First of all, get fudge dice, you know the ones that have an equal number of pluses, minuses and blanks.

I'm not kidding; do not let them start taking about +3 and -2 and stuff.<br/><br/><br/>Then make new playbooks such that:<br/><br/>Choose one set:<br/>\u2022 Cool+1 Hard=0 Hot+1 Sharp+2 Weird-1<br/>\u2022 Cool+1 Hard+1 Hot=0 Sharp+2 Weird-1<br/>\u2022 Cool-1 Hard+1 Hot=0 Sharp+2 Weird+1<br/>\u2022 Cool+2 Hard=0 Hot-1 Sharp+2 Weird-1<br/><br/>Becomes this:<br/><br/>Choose one set:<br/>\u2022 Kind of cool, a little bit hard, kind of hot, very sharp, not really that weird.<br/>\u2022 Kind of cool, kind of hard, a little bit hot, very sharp, not really that weird.<br/>\u2022 Not really that cool, kind of hard, a little bit hot, very sharp, kind of weird.<br/>\u2022 Very cool, a little bit hard, not really that hot, very sharp, not really that weird.<br/><br/>Teach your players how to roll like this (I'm serious, follow this procedure, it'll become fast after a while and you'll use the scale in your head after a while, but be careful about shortcutting it in the beginning):<br/>Let's say you have to roll to act coolly and that you are a little bit cool.<br/>Put your finger "A little bit". Roll four of the dice. Remove any + - pair because they cancel out. Then for each remaining +, move your finger up once, and for each -, move your finger down once.<br/>Let's say you rolled ++_-. The minus and the + cancel out, leaving +. Move your finger up once on the scale for the remaining +. It ends on "Kind of" You acted kind of coolly.<br/><br/>Before you teach them that (but I wanted to explain it to you, the converter, first), change the moves so that this:<br/><br/><br/>DO SOMETHING UNDER FIRE<br/>When you do something under fire, or dig in to endure fire,<br/>roll+cool. On a 10+, you do it. On a 7\u20139, you flinch, hesitate, or<br/>stall: the MC can offer you a worse outcome, a hard bargain, or<br/>an ugly choice.<br/>becomes <br/><br/>DO SOMETHING UNDER FIRE<br/>When you do something under fire, or dig in to endure fire, roll to<br/>act coolly. If you act very coolly or cooler, you can do it. If you<br/>act kind of, or a little bit cool, you flinch, hesitate, or stall: the<br/>MC can offer you a worse outcome, a hard bargain, or an ugly choice.<br/><br/>(Uh, maybe that phrasing needs a little work.)<br/>Anyway, the point is to change all 7-9 results to "Kind of" and "A little bit", all 6- results to "Not really that" and lower, and all 10+ results to "Very" and higher.<br/>It's a lot of work converting or redoing all the playbooks but once that's done, your players won't see any numbers any more and you'll be happily in "word land".<br/><br/>Put that ladder right on every playbook near the stats, or on laminated cards. Use the version that does <em>not</em> have the numbers. I'm serious. Do not show it.<br/><br/>I've worked on the probabilities and they match pretty well from the start and across the advancements. You'll get pretty close to the same percentages of successes, misses, and 7-9:s.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453466/#Comment_453466" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-22T08:09:15+00:00" title="May 22, 2016  8:09AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a>, that's some pretty cool work you did!<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/systemtwin">@systemtwin</a>, not the same thing but, for example\u2026 me &amp; my friends once created a desert "frontier planet" space colony setting playing <i>Archipelago II</i>, which I later wrote down as a setting document for <i>Anima Prime</i>. I then proceeded to use it more than once when demonstrating AP at local game conventions.<br/><br/>Archipelago and AP are very different role-playing games from each other. The former encourages creating your world as you go (or exploring a known literary, non-game world), the latter requires a setting document as the starting point for creating characters. The former is dice-less and impro-y, the latter is crunchy and fight-y with heaping piles of dice. And Archipelago is meant to be played over much fewer sessions than AP. What they have in common is just some incredibly baseline features: being "fantasy" of a sort (but only in the broadest, non-restrictive sense), a strong focus on the player characters (similar to what you find in AW) and an emphasis on working together to build a story with everyone's contribution being equally important.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453467/#Comment_453467" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-22T08:30:47+00:00" title="May 22, 2016  8:30AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks!

So cool that you're actually gonna do it!<br/><br/>As for system, I think PbtA is fine, but apocalyptica is inextricably embedded in AW, and I sure wouldn't want to turn the characters you describe into pieces of that.  But if you look through the playbooks (and especially their moves) and decide, "Yes, our characters should be that!" then I think you're set; go for it.<br/><br/>Personally I would use Primetime Adventures.  Quiet Year was basically your PtA pitch session, and now you're ready to just start framing scenes and playing.  Just note down a core issue and a few other details about each character, grab a deck of cards and a stack of tokens, and start delving into character arcs.  There's no math at all, and it'll leave the tone of your setting unchanged.  If you'd rather not focus on what makes the characters tick and addressing their personal crises, though, then maybe not; PtA is built around that.  Also has fanmail, which some people love and some people hate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/systemtwin" title="systemtwin"><img alt="systemtwin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/systemtwin">systemtwin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453495/#Comment_453495" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-22T18:52:47+00:00" title="May 22, 2016  6:52PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On the issue of whether or not AW/PbtA would suit this step (<a href="/forums/profile/semiomant%29">@semiomant)</a>: That was something that I found myself thinking about while looking through all the current PbtA hacks. I love the design of the system, so I kept hoping that I'd find a hack that miraculously suited the setting. But so many of them are world-specific or goal-specific that either they don't fit, or there isn't a sufficient preview of them to merit buying the playbook just to see (money is an issue). And I just hit the bit of example play with Marie the Brainer in the AW playbook - I don't know if I think this world is <i>that</i> violent? More than anything, the lack of gasoline and bullets in this world clashes strongly with AW. Maybe something more like a post-apocalyptic Ryuutama would fit better?<br/><br/>We didn't do anything to change the TQY rules specifically, but TQY's idea of this being the last year for your community before The End implies that whatever's on the other side of the Frost Shepherds, it certainly isn't whatever you made. There aren't rules against using a TQY world as a setting, but the feeling I got from the rules was that once the game is done, the world is too, and you move to something else.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Rafu">@Rafu</a>: Anima Prime seems like a pretty cool system! I don't know if it supports the setting (though I do love me some FF), but I just found the CC version of the rules, so I'm giving it a look. This group seems much more suited to story games and flavorful RP as opposed to straight D&amp;D, so something like AP might work well for them. Also, I'm glad someone else has done this mix-and-match of systems too! I never realized TQY would be such a great worldbuilder, so I'm interested to see what other combinations I could try in the future.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">@Simon_Pettersson</a>: I've definitely looked at the page for Dream Askew before (frequent trawls through the Buried without Ceremony page), but I initially discounted it because these are new roleplayers, and they're all hetero. Two are a married couple, and the two guys in the group are very not into guys (they could play girls, of course, but re:new roleplayers). Looking at the rules now, it seems like a simpler AW with power distributed between players instead of with the GM, and the queer element isn't as thoroughly embedded in the rules as the summary page made it seem. I almost feel like the prototypical conservative parent - "how do I tell my children/players about the gays?" Has anyone else experienced bringing this system to its opposite population?<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a>: Definitely give it a shot! It's a little odd that all the players have top-down knowledge of the world pre-apocalypse, but if I/we change the environment enough, their prior knowledge won't help them. It's interesting that PtA uses all the same physical components, too, so "it slots in" is way too accurate. AP and PtA both seem to have a scene-based approach to character interactions, so I'm interested in seeing how they differ, and which one might work better.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a>: Dang, that's awesome! I have yet to buy fudge dice, but (a) I really should, and (b) this seems super useful for anyone that wants to keep their AW math-less. Regardless of whether or not we use AW or a hack, I'm favoriting this post in case I need to use those rerules.<br/><br/>Thanks for all your comments, everyone!

The one time I played, all of my co-players were people who, as far as I know them, identify as cishetbinary, but queerness was still part - and a focus - of the fiction we made. I suppose conveying the queerness is part of what the game tries to do, irrespective of player disposition. OTOH, I suppose it might be quite confusing to navigate the game text/s in case nobody at the table had ever encounter the slightest hint of thinking critically about gender before\u2026 I don't rule out it might be an epiphany, but could merely be unintelligible instead. But as long as at least one person (you?) has a basic understanding of gender as a non-binary thing - and nobody's a bigot - they could help the others get their bearing well enough to make it into a learning experience.<br/><br/>Anyway, considering the maths issue you mentioned, I strongly second Primetime Adventures, and also suggest <a href="https://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/2012/09/20/archipelago-iii/" rel="nofollow">Archipelago</a> if you're looking for an (inexpensive) alternative.

Instead, the assumption is that gender is nonbinary. But strictly speaking, the only in-your-face place this comes up in the game is when you choose your gender (and, to some extent, look). I've played this half a dozen times with many different players, none of which, as far as I know, identify as being anything but binary, cis and hetero. It's never been even remotely an issue, but then I'm in Sweden, and wherever you are might be much more conservative. The only stumbling block can be when people ask "So, is "raven" a, like, real gender thing that people identify with? Or is it made up for this game?" And then we discuss it or google it.<br/><br/>Honestly though, the queer theme is easily removed from the game if you think it can be an issue. I'd go with "Well, we've created this place and we haven't specifically said anything about it being a "Queer enclave", so feel free to create any kind of characters you feel like, queer or not. It's all good". Depending on how you created the surroundings, you might need to remove The Society Intact as an element, too, and maybe even the Maelstrom, but that shouldn't be too hard. I've played replacing the Psychic Maelstrom with the Digital Realm and it worked really well. All the Situations could be customized rather easily, as they're mostly flavor text, anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/systemtwin" title="systemtwin"><img alt="systemtwin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/systemtwin">systemtwin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453503/#Comment_453503" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-23T06:49:41+00:00" title="May 23, 2016  6:49AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 23, 2016 6:50AM by systemtwin.">edited May 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not that they're opposed to queer elements in games - these are pretty liberal, open-minded people, who definitely cheered when gay marriage was legalized in our state. The issue is more that I'm not sure if, as new roleplayers, they're equipped to deal with playing characters with opposing sexualities. They haven't even attempted opposing genders yet! For all three of them, these are the <i>very first characters they have ever rolled,</i> in whatever system we end up running with. Our game of TQY is their only previous experience with TTRPGs, and it's essentially character-less.<br/><br/>So, I guess more than anything, I'm having stress moments trying to pinpoint the *perfect* system not only to suit this setting, but also these players. They're lovely people and will roll with whatever, even if there's more math than expected, but ugh! I just want to do good. I need something where the rules can bleed into normal interactions like in AW, where there's pre-existing character entanglements, but with a slightly lower level of violence or at least a slightly lower expectation of violence. Dream Askew seems like it might be best, and I just need to get over myself!

What about all the human teenagers playing the role of centuries-old vampires or elf wizards? <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Second, when the game <i>is</i> about being a certain way, and it's being distributed around the Internet as a role-playing game, you can probably trust the game to include tools to make players fit into their characters shoes, because that's probably <i>the point</i> of that game existing: easing players into a different point of view.<br/><br/>Third, a "queer enclave" like introduced in DA is, by definition, an inclusive world. It doesn't oppose anything really, it allows for everything and everyone. It's the "society intact" which excludes, which tells you you have to be a certain specific way to fit.\n<blockquote>I need something where the rules can bleed into normal interactions like in AW, where there's pre-existing character entanglements, but with a slightly lower level of violence or at least a slightly lower expectation of violence.</blockquote>\nOnce you take away most of the guns from AW, the promise of violence is much lowered. Vet which character playbooks you're making available based on your (plural) vision for the game: definitely take away the Hardholder, Gunlugger and probably a bunch more. Cross out guns as a starting gear option from some others.

I think it's an excellent idea, though, like the others here, I've never really managed to pull this off to the extent that I wanted. For years now, I've wanted to play out a specific scenario/adventure using three or four different systems, simply as a gaming experiment. I think it would be very interesting!<br/><br/>I *have* done successfully in a more limited way with Monsterhearts and Fiasco with this playset:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/17956/it-all-ends-in-tears-monsterhearts-and-fiasco" rel="nofollow">It All Ends in Tears</a><br/><br/>Lots of fun! (And great for beginners.)<br/><br/>2. If you want to use AW, you're bound to inject certain dynamics and fictional content, since the game is all built on inspiring fictional colour.<br/><br/>However, if you have a "gentler" apocalypse, you could probably do that by picking out all the "non-combat" playbooks. There aren't too many, but if you have access to all the more out-there playbooks - <a href="http://nerdwerds.blogspot.ca/2012/12/all-of-playbooks.html" rel="nofollow">e.g. here</a> - you can pick out a set which suits your game.<br/><br/><i>Dream Askew</i> seems like a solid choice, as well.<br/><br/>3. Since your starting game/session is going to generate a lot of material for you, you're probably best off if you pick a system which is fairly "bland" or "generic", to accomodate all the elements you've already created, instead of trying to supplant them.<br/><br/>A few suggestions:<br/><br/>* The Shadow of Yesterday/The Solar System is an excellent "generic" ruleset for character-driven roleplaying, an indie favourite.<br/>* If your group is fine with just a generic resolution mechanic, consider Vincent Baker's "Otherkind dice". It's not a full game with support, though.<br/>* If you want a more intense/dramatic game, you could use the rules from Dogs in the Vineyard - take out the setting stuff and just use the conflict mechanic. Would suit a post-apocalyptic setting quite well.<br/>* Primetime Adventures could work, too.<br/><br/>Sandra, nice AW hack! I like it. I had a whole Fudge hack using Adverbs I wrote up long ago; this reminds me of it quite a bit. Using adverbs instead of adjectives allows you to use the "ladder" in written or spoken English much more easily, so we're on the same page here!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453968">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453968/#Comment_453968" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-20T04:40:17+00:00" title="June 20, 2016  4:40AM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread inspired me to write up a basic roleplaying game ruleset which might be well suited to something like this. <br/><br/>Here it is:<br/><br/><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/plgnh4sxvceyuhx/Burned%20at%20the%20Stake.pdf?dl=0" rel="nofollow">Burned at the Stake</a><br/><br/>I think that if you have a strong basis (a fertile fictional situation) something this simple (and focused on character's cares and woes) could be just the ticket.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
