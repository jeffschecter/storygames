And it's always raised as a polite question, usually after praising something else about the game. It's a subtle, undercover way of saying "I don't like it".<br/><br/>This particularly bugs me with reviews of my Cthulhu scenarios. They play very well, both when I run them and when others run them. And the standard review I get is praise, followed by "but would it work in play"?<br/><br/>I remember a similar phrase being used to dismiss Steal Away Jordan. Would it actually be fun to play?

I think reviewing a product that you don't know with some degree of intimacy is unethical.  Maybe it's <i>only</i> asinine if it's entirely clear to your audience that you don't have any fucking idea what you're talking about.  <br/><br/>We're talking about <i>reviews</i>, right; with some level of formality?  Not just a discussion: "hey I picked up Graham's new scenario and he does this neat thing in it but I'm not sure it'd be fun to play."  That's a fair thing to ask and discuss, but not really a review.  Yeah?<br/><br/>Seems to me that if you're writing a review you should already be in a position to judge whether it was fun and spell it out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307242/#Comment_307242" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-07T07:11:33+00:00" title="January  7, 2011  7:11AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Christopher, I know where you're coming from.<br/><br/>The thing is: sometimes, someone will buy a game, and just post their initial impressions on a blog. And then I think it's fine that they're reviewing without playing.<br/><br/>Or, sometimes, there'll be a new book of scenarios, and I wouldn't expect a reviewer to play every one before reviewing it.<br/><br/>And I've seen C. W. Richeson argue that playing something for just one session can be misleading, so he'd rather not do it. I don't really agree with him, but I think it's a valid argument.<br/><br/>So I can understand that reviewers review without playing. However, when they do, I'd prefer they didn't speculate on what play would be like.

A closer analogy would be a review of a musical instrument or, perhaps, a Lego set: a review like that CAN be solely aesthetic, based on "unboxing," without having to actually play the instrument (err... hmmm... OK, I'm not 100% on that parallel) or build the set's model to speak to the merits of the products.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>OK, lemme try again: On the CONTINUUM of utility of a review, RPG reviews without play are summaries of rules and setting elements, and some presentation of packaging/aesthetics. If one presents it as such (and readers acknowledge it as such) that is totally valid "review." At the other end of the continuum is the review written by someone who plays the game for many, many sessions (or campaigns!); has played many, many similar games over the years (no one's spoken to authority or credibility yet);  has maybe designed a similar game or other game types (as contrasting experience); and has advanced training in literary criticism, logic, mathematics, and psychology (and game theory--but that's sort of all those things in one super-set).<br/><br/>If the only thing we use, as consumers, is the Uber Reviewer end of the continuum, then we won't have a lot of data points. But we shouldn't weigh data points equally, so the slew of "unboxing", superficial reviews should be weighted appropriately (i.e. lightly, as compared to the Uber Reviewer).<br/><br/>Make sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307291">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307291/#Comment_307291" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-07T10:20:33+00:00" title="January  7, 2011 10:20AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the phrase makes the review useless.

Let's say next month Chaosium releases Elizabethan Cthulhu, a complete game like Dark Ages Cthulhu or Roman Cthulhu but set in Elizabethan England.<br/><br/>Frankly, if you've played a lot of BRP and a fair bit of Cthulhu then the few rules changes it will have won't be so fundamental it won't be obvious to you how they work in play.  You can review it without playing it.<br/><br/>By contrast, if it's some indie game by a new designer using new mechanics, obviously you have to play it.  <br/><br/>The difference is with the first you've played a lot of stuff like it and can extrapolate.  With the second you can't.<br/><br/>Also, I really don't see the the ethical issue as long as it's clear if you've played it or not.  If it's clear you haven't those who feel reviewers should play first can simply disregard the review.<br/><br/>But, for all that, if at the end you say would it be fun to play you're saying two things to my mind:<br/><br/>1.  I wasn't able to review this without playing it but did so anyway.  I've wasted your time.<br/><br/>2.  I don't think it would be fun, but I can't substantiate that.<br/><br/>Lame.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307292/#Comment_307292" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-07T10:25:00+00:00" title="January  7, 2011 10:25AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, game books aren't novels, aren't films, aren't meals.

A game book isn't the experience, it's not the object of the purchase, it's a tool to get to the experience which is a game session.  A review of a game book inevitably isn't like a review of a book or a meal.  A review of a session of play would be like a review of a book or meal.  <br/><br/>The analogies are easy, but they're wrong.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307302/#Comment_307302" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-07T10:44:40+00:00" title="January  7, 2011 10:44AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 7, 2011 10:45AM by Marhault.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seriously, guys?  Sure, games are made to be played, we all know that, but a review is a statement of the reviewers opinions and impressions.  Are you saying that you can't hold opinions or form impressions of a game without having played it?<br/><br/>Is one session of Burning Empires enough experience with the game to write a review?  I've "played the game" but not through an entire playcycle.  What about one Infection phase?  Oh, well, I haven't played the entire invasion?  Not good enough.<br/><br/>Bullshit.<br/><br/>The usefulness of a review in part on the depth of the reviewers experience with the game.  Yes, that's true.  To that extent, it's obvious that the reviewers experience with the game in question should thus be <i>disclosed</i> in the review to better inform the reader.  For example:<br/><br/>"In reading the text, I found the rules to be complex and poorly explained.  We never even really tried to play it because of these problems."<br/>"The mechanics for monster creation are so cool.  I rolled up three right then and there, and I can't wait to get them on the table and kill some PCs with them."<br/>"After the fourth session, we found that combat become repetitive and boring and moved on to another game."<br/><br/>Each useful, and based on different levels of experience with the game.<br/><br/>As for speculating about play, well, again, games <i>are</i> made to be played.  I read the rules and post about how I think X section will work in play and that it looks like fun or that I don't think the math works out right.  Isn't that appropriate?  Nothing in a review should be done idly, Graham.  This included.<br/><br/>So, seriously.  Ease up on it a little.  Have you played FATAL?<br/><br/>Oh, and, just for fun, since we're engaging in that kind of conversation.  "I looked the menu over quite closely. The "Chef" has prepared a number of plates containing several forms of what appeared to be overcooked microwave pizza entrees. When the surly waiter arrived bearing cheap domestic beer with a dead cockroach floating in it, I excused myself and left without tasting the food. I feel quite comfortable giving this restaurant 1 of 5 stars, and I hope that my loyal readers will stay the living hell away from it, for the sake of their health and good taste. My only reservation is that I cannot honestly say that I actually ate anything there."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307303/#Comment_307303" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-07T10:49:01+00:00" title="January  7, 2011 10:49AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 7, 2011 10:52AM by timonkey.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The cookbook analogy holds well though.  There you buy the book, but what you really want is to cook delicious (or maybe easy) food.  Reviewing based only on reading the recipes doesn't really evaluate what purchasing the books gives you, because the food isn't evaluated.<br/><br/>Also, in both cooking and games, it may not be obvious that steps aren't detailed adequately in the book for you to do what it tells you without some other knowledge or just making something up.<br/><br/><br/>The only problem I have with statements like in the OP, is that before you get to that line at the end, it may seem like the reviewer did in deed play the game.

I tried to create pregens so I could run it for my group and so people could dive straight in (we do that occasionally when trying out a wholly new game).<br/><br/>I couldn't get through chargen.  The layout and rules were just too confusing.  In the end I had to abort the session as I couldn't make the pregens for it.<br/><br/>I'd have been comfortable reviewing that game without playing it.<br/><br/>What I wouldn't do is review say The Dying of St. Margarets without playing it.  I've seen a copy, I have a vague feel for it, but I've no real idea how it would play and I couldn't really speculate.  (I actually wish I hadn't seen it, because I won't run it and now I can't play it).<br/><br/>I could of course write it up, explain the concepts and the layout and all that good stuff and end by saying "but would it be fun to play?" but I'm not sure what use that would be to anyone.<br/><br/>Edit:  I realised "I won't run it" sounds kind of harsh.  It's not meant to be.  I never run published scenarios and I know my group wouldn't like purist CoC.  The scenario actually looked quite good to me which is why I'd have preferred not to be familiar with it and to play it some time at a con or something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nameless" title="Nameless"><img alt="Nameless" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nameless">Nameless</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307319/#Comment_307319" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-07T12:02:08+00:00" title="January  7, 2011 12:02PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Marhault, I am also not saying that you must play a full campaign with any game you plan to review. I am saying that your review should look <a href="http://rdonoghue.blogspot.com/2011/01/castle-ravenloft-product.html" rel="nofollow">more like this,</a>, if you have not played it. Then you can add <a href="http://rdonoghue.blogspot.com/2011/01/castle-ravenloft-game.html" rel="nofollow">something like this</a> to comment on the play. A restaurant reviewer that wrote only with a familiarity of the menu would not help anyone, except those who would not eat at a place with certain things on he menu, or demands certain things from a menu to eat there. Same with a game reviewer. For games, I want to know about both the game as a product and the game as a game. A game product has to meet a certain threshold before it is useable as a game (readability, understandability, catchiness...) but the real importance of a game is the game play. If you are only familiar with the product and not the game play, then don't review the game. Review the product, and state so explicitly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307325">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307325/#Comment_307325" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-07T12:25:42+00:00" title="January  7, 2011 12:25PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lee, I don't think we're too far apart, and the rest is just a matter of taste.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307405/#Comment_307405" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-08T04:25:04+00:00" title="January  8, 2011  4:25AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is all forgetting that sometimes people are seen as experts and even their cursory opinions are sought out or valued by others.
