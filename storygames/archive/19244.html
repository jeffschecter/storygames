One big roadblock I always hit is that it seems to me most of these settings are set up so epicly around one set of characters, that they don't really leave room for anything else. So, if you would, take me "behind the scenes" into your creative process for writing a campaign or making a character for a setting of a popular universe!                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428746/#Comment_428746" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-25T02:21:32+00:00" title="February 25, 2014  2:21AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like to take a page out of the superhero rpg playbook, and have the players play those central characters, sort of like how a DC or Marvel rpg might encourage you to play Spider-Man. Just assume that the story has not happened yet, and may evolve in an entirely different direction depending on the actions of the players, and hey presto! Dramatic irony will abound.<br/><br/>The alternative is to basically design a new campaign from scratch, which implies that the setting might inform your choices, but it won't be normative; there is no guarantee that any given setting will be any good for a campaign different from the one implied by its central story, so it might be easy or difficult to accomplish this, all depending on whether the setting is any good for your needs. The important point is, it's no more or less difficult than designing for a setting that doesn't have pre-existing stories told about it. Same techniques apply, and success or failure may be obtained for the same reasons.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/arscott" title="arscott"><img alt="arscott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/arscott">arscott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428748/#Comment_428748" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-25T03:47:30+00:00" title="February 25, 2014  3:47AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that different settings call for different approaches.  Frankly, I don't think you need to do anything special to run a Firefly game.  The crew of the Serenity were central characters to the show, but they weren't really central characters to the setting.<br/><br/>OTOH, the Characters of LotR are kings, princes, and powerful wizards.  The few characters that were of relatively humble origin manage to drastically re-shape the world by their actions.  If you're running in a setting like that, you need to find a way of actively side-lining those characters.  Star Wars, of course, is a little from column A and a little from column B, depending on what you're doing with that setting.<br/><br/>Regardless, you need to kill strict canon.  It doesn't matter that the Enterprise-D was destroyed before the Dominion War, what happens in your adventure trumps what happens in the movies.<br/><br/>Here are two approaches I've taken:<br/>For a Star Wars game, I completely ditched the official SW universe.  I used the SW system, and drew elements from the setting (in particular, I drew lots of names and inspirations from the Early Draft screenplays).  It felt like a Star Wars game in all the ways that mattered, but I didn't have to worry about Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker.<br/><br/>For an X-men game, I incorporated many of the Characters in supporting roles, w/out sticking to any particular comics continuity.  The players were students at the Xavier institute.  Certain x-characters were their teachers, and others were their classmates.  I approached it the way that the writers of TV and movie adaptations do--I pulled themes from the X-books, and chose supporting characters that fit my theme and plot needs without a lot of concern for whether I was using them in the exact same way that the comic book did.<br/><br/>A third approach, which I have not taken, is to set your game in the past or future, far enough removed from the events of the original story that PCs are not eclipsed by characters from the original work.  This is basically what the Knights of the Old Republic computer games did.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Crunch" title="Crunch"><img alt="Crunch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Crunch">Crunch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428756/#Comment_428756" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-25T06:34:34+00:00" title="February 25, 2014  6:34AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 25, 2014 7:09AM by Crunch.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It depends on the setting, the world, and what your characters want out of the experience. A few examples looking at published settings. <br/><br/>In the case of Tolkein's Middle Earth or Star Wars for example the world itself is fairly vast with a lot of room around the edges. The old ICE <b>Middle Earth Roleplay </b>(MERP) envisioned the game that was set in Tolkein's world, but in which the characters weren't particularly engaged with the grand metaplot. You played characters that did the things that Rolemaster characters did (explore, kill monsters, adventure), you just did them in a world that was richer for Tolkein's world building. <b>The One Ring </b>on the other hand sets the game after the events of the Hobbit but 80 or so years before the events of <b>Lord of the Rings</b>.  The characters engage with the metaplot (the finding of the ring, the return of Sauron, things stirring at the edges of the world), but at a point that is between the key beats that Tolkein wrote in. <br/><br/>Star Wars <b>Edge of the Empire</b>(EotE) takes a similar approach. Here the characters are fringers, scoundrels and guns for hire in the time leading up to the rebellion. In an average EotE game it's more than likely that the players will address the Empire as the voice of authority they're trying to avoid. EotE characters are the people hanging out at the Bar in Mos Eisley, or working on contract at Cloud City. They're not trying to blow up the Death Star, just scratch out a living on a corrupt frontier. They may at some point become involved with the Rebellion (either for or against), but the game doesn't demand it. The old WEG D6 <b>Star Wars Roleplaying Game </b>generally assumed that characters were part of the Rebellion, but just off screen from the stuff covered in the movies. <br/><br/><b>Marvel Heroic </b>more or less assumes you will play the Marvel heroes. That's a simple approach, and one that's satisfying to players who love the universe. The old TSR <b>Marvel Superheroes </b>game on the other hand assumed that the players would be new heroes in the Marvel Universe. The simplest approach to this was simply to use the comic book logic that allows Manhattan to house the Avengers, the Fantastic Four, Dr Strange, Spiderman (sometimes), Daredevil, Iron Man, and a dozen other heroes and still have street crime to foil. The Avengers source book on the other hand suggested that the players create an Avengers franchise (Like the West Coast Avengers, or Great Lake Avengers) somewhere that wasn't covered by an existing team. My friends and I ran a relatively long running game centering around the exploits of the Rio Grande Avengers led by the Cold War defector Superhero Captain Poland. The strength of the "new heroes" approach is simply that it gives the players the agency to create and develop, but still engage with the Villains of the heroic world. <br/><br/><b>Firefly</b> is pretty simple. You can certainly take the crew of the Serenity, buy that's not needed. The setting as described by Wheedon in the show is a grand place to use as a sandbox, and there's a great cast of supporting characters and locations to draw from. When it gets right down to it Firefly doesn't have a whole lot of metaplot. Mal has a story, but it's not all that world shattering. The easiest approach would just be to make characters, figure out what they're doing and send them out into the verse. <br/><br/><b>Game of Thrones </b>on the other hand would be a hard one. There is one central story, and it is intricate and deterministic. I suspect that the best one could do is set the story right after the current book, and expect it to veer from canon rapidly. Like Dragonlance the world's story is such that giving the players agency will derail the plot pretty substantially. That makes it, in my mind, a difficult place to play. One exception might be to take the approach of EotE. There's no reason you couldn't run a game set on the Wall with the Night's Watch, or on the edges among folks that aren't involved in the grand political wheel.<br/><br/>I hope that's helpful.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428757/#Comment_428757" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-25T06:36:46+00:00" title="February 25, 2014  6:36AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 25, 2014 6:37AM by zircher.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I've done this in the past, my preferred MO is to create character sized holes in the setting and have the players step into them.

You might also look up Ron Edwards' concept of the "underbelly", which is another example of an approach to this.<br/><br/>I'll add another option:<br/><br/>Play the "What if?" game. Take some minor element of the setting or story and change it just a little. Having done that, leave everything else as close to the normal story as possible. "What if Luke Skywalker was a rich noblewoman's son?" "What if the Ring had fallen into the hands of the Sackville-Bagginses instead of Bilbo and Frodo?" <br/><br/>The nice about this is that it gives everyone something to explore together: how does *this* particular change interact with establish elements in the story or setting, and how can we highlight that? It also subtly tells everyone involved that the story WILL diverge from established canon and we're OK with that. If, instead of hobbits, we have some Goblins take the Ring on the Fellowship and travel to Mordor... we no longer know whether they will succeed. We can play with established storyline material (e.g. the Mines of Moria, or the attack by Saruman's Uruk-Hai), but no one is going to be shocked if events turn out differently: we all know that seeing *how* things turn out differently is the very purpose of play here, something we can all frame together.<br/><br/>This is very different from a game where we just play established characters in an established storyline - that causes all the players to be at odds with the game process. Do I have to act as my character did in the canon? If I do something else, am I ruining it for everyone else, will they find it too jarring? It's a hard line to tread and you never know when you're crossing it. But establish some difference and we can all find a common creative agenda in highlighting it and playing off it together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428798/#Comment_428798" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-25T15:56:00+00:00" title="February 25, 2014  3:56PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am running a campaign set in Gotham City of Batman fame. The characters are regular criminals in the city who suffer the effect of freaks like the Joker taking over the world of crime and Batman putting a pressuer on every criminal. So they have a different role in the world than the original main character, who is more of a force of nature in the system but adds a familiarity.<br/>Playing in another niche of the world and from a different perspective than the main character is working out well so far and an approach that might work for other stories as well.<br/><br/>I refamiliarised myself with the universe before planning how to use it for an RPG and also communicated with the other players. Getting their view of the world and the characters, asking what they would want to show up and what they did not like. Getting on the same page was important especially with a character that has as many possible versions as Batman. For characters that are limited to a few source and a single author this step might be easier, but still important.<br/><br/>I am, even if the stories are different, trying to get the feel right. So that the players can say "That felt like a Batman story" even if they were on the other side of his heroics.<br/>On the other hand I am not afraid to remix a few things and bring them into a new perspective. Like using a few lesser known Batman characters in a changed fashion to fill roles in the criminal underworld (KGBeast as an former russian agent and now Boss of the Russian mob) the characters interact with. To have my own look for the world and make stuff I want to reference fit. <br/><br/>With every player somewhat familiar with the source material I can easily drop hints and nods for the players that work. even if they are not clear for the characters. It does take out some of the suprises that might be there with unknown characters but can add tension to a scene, if they know how dangerous the person they are interacting with is. But play their characters as if they didn't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428872">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo" title="w00hoo"><img alt="w00hoo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/395/nB2PXS15U6BFQ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo">w00hoo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428872/#Comment_428872" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-27T02:11:34+00:00" title="February 27, 2014  2:11AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I tend to go with 'use the story as backdrop and play different characters' approach. I've played games where you play the actual characters at Cons and it can be fun, but also tends to be quite limiting and leads to 'would they, wouldn't they?' debates amongst the table. Everyone has a view on how and why canon characters did things and in practice it can be quite tough to let that go. Similarly, some people just don't like playing the main characters of the fiction, my wife is happily playing Supernatural, but stated right at the beginning she had no interest in being at a table where people were pretending to be Sam and Dean and messing with the canon.<br/><br/>I've seen Firefly done really well where the GM put in the crew of the Betty from Aliens 4. So established characters, but out of place. Doubly clever as they were still Whedon creations.<br/><br/>The Living Force Star Wars campaign just put everyone out on a wing of the galaxy where the canon stuff could have reflections, but you were telling a different story. Pretty tried and tested.<br/><br/>Most existing product, especially in the internet age, has sufficient stuff around it that it can be used without needing the main canon characters within it and even if you are putting them in I see little point in then saying 'this has to happen, because it did' so aside from having comfortable characters to slip in to it's still not really going to be playing through the stories that have already been told. If you want to do that you might just as well watch the movie and then argue over it afterwards with pizza.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
