It is inspired by the anime Neon Genesis Evangelion. Here's the pitch:<br/><br/>As the Prophecy foretold, the Sword of Damocles is falling upon the Earth. Carried by its Attendants, when it strikes the world will end. But the Prophecy also tells us of how we can avoid it, and we have the tool with which we can do it: the TITAN.<br/>The TITAN is a towering colossus, and when a Child of sufficient destiny merges with the TITAN, the monstrosity can move and act in our defense. However, in the mind of the beast, the child and the TITAN struggle for dominance over the body, trying to avoid being subjugated and subsumed by the other, despite their shared goal.<br/>The Sword and its Attendants have arrived. The First Child is ready to fight. But it is the Third Child who is spoken of in the Prophecy.<br/><br/>TITAN/child is a game about a TITAN mind struggling for autonomy and a series of children trying not to get burned out before the world ends. It is a game for 2 players, one of whom plays the TITAN and one of whom will play the children. It will (probably) take about 2-3 hours, and requires one small d6 and one large d6.<br/><a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/56d7211960b5e9a191fddb45/t/5893f2f32994ca737e3c24a6/1486090997483/TITAN+-+child+v3.pdf" rel="nofollow"><br/>DOWNLOAD THE GAME HERE</a><br/><br/>It is currently unplaytested, though that will hopefully not remain that case for long. I'm pretty proud of how the game works, and hopefully y'all like it too!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
