Besides my many issues with that review this particular comment struck a chord in me.  It made me think of the link Paul Tevis pointed out to me about the Gorilla Wingman in the SotC thread I started where I said I'd never seen a robo-zombie-nazi in a pulp story.  I put all this together and I realized what my beef with pulp gaming is.<br/><br/>All the pulp games on the market (that I know of) are about celebrating the *whole* of pulp fiction *including* the bad stuff.  Robo-zombie-nazis are funny so let's get together and cheer them on.  No one has done for the other pulp genres (western, crime fighting, war stories, exploration, non-Lovecraftian weird horror, etc) what Ron did for Swords and Sorcery.  No one has dug into the fiction and thrown out all the bad stuff and really examined what's left over and made a game about that.<br/><br/>I'm reminded of the self-directed study I did of Gothic literature.  I was shocked to discover that Ann Radcliffe's The Mysteries of Udolpho is held up as the key work of the genre because it contains every element typically touted as being *bad* about the genre.  WTF?  Seriously, The Mysteries of Udolpho is the pinnacle of a genre because of how *BAD* it is? (And they're right, that's 800 pages of my life I will never get back).  Especially when Ms. Radcliffe gave us Romance of the Forest which is 18th century awesomeness!<br/><br/>So....yeah....that's my beef with pulp gaming.<br/><br/>Jesse                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153416/#Comment_153416" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-27T14:18:40+00:00" title="June 27, 2008  2:18PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's an interesting point. I come at pulp gaming from a bit more of a deconstructive angle - i.e. we are snickering behind our hands at the racism and sexism of the form, or eliminating the more objectionable parts - and as a result, I don't mind keeping the "bad stuff" in.  I share a birthday with Sax Rohmer, creator of Fu Manchu, which is both fundamentally pulp adventure and truly awful in its treatment of race, sex, and even class.  If you enjoy Rohmer's stories, you have to address those issues somehow in your own mind, and if you're playing Thrilling Tales or Two-Fisted Tales or Adventure! in the style of such a story, you have to be able to do the same. Mere lack of literary merit doesn't bother me nearly as much!<br/><br/>I see the weakness of pulp gaming in a different area.  For example, sword and sorcery gaming has done virtually nothing to help people tell or play in games that are like pulp sword and sorcery stories.  People said Eberron was "really pulp D&amp;D" but that to me is highly redundant. D&amp;D is pulp fantasy, it has to be.  You fight snakes with swords. That D&amp;D has passed over the tools developed in the pulp fantasy genre does not change its essential nature. But there's virtually no pulp gaming that is based on, say, pulp romance, or pulp Westerns, two ridiculously gigantic areas of pulp <i>that even survive and prosper into the present day!</i>  Instead, people are reaching back to zeppelins and tough guys fighting Ratzis, in which little significant has been done in a long time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153422/#Comment_153422" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-27T15:36:27+00:00" title="June 27, 2008  3:36PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JD, you remind me of something else.

If you do a <i>Sorcerer &amp; Sword</i> on them, and try to get to the heart of the genre... well, I think what's left IS mainstream adventure fiction - in other words, the same thing that drives pretty much all RPGs. "Pulp", in the <i>Indiana Jones</i> robots &amp; nazis pastiche form that the genre is typified by in gaming circles, is all color.<br/><br/>Why don't you see romance pulp, western pulp, etc? Because those tropes don't have the same "geek appeal" as robots &amp; nazis? Or because they're not Thrilling Adventures full of Daring Heroes and Dastardly Villains...? (okay, westerns are sometimes)<br/><br/>I love "pulp" as much as the next geek, but I don't think that "pulp" in gaming terms has much to do with anything thematic in the way Sword &amp; Sorcery is still an identifiable Thing even stripped of the pulpy trappings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog" title="Z-Dog"><img alt="Z-Dog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog">Z-Dog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153430/#Comment_153430" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-27T16:57:20+00:00" title="June 27, 2008  4:57PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "No one has dug into the fiction and thrown out all the bad stuff and really examined what's left over and made a game about that."<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat's the "good" stuff?

The book was pretty good on at least identifying specific source stories and characters.<br/><br/>That said, because it covered EVERYTHING (as all Hero books did) it has that kitchen sink feel you're talking about.<br/><br/>I think it's important to add that the whole idea that you would look under the hood of the color is kind of new.  Ron is kind of the champion of that, as far as I can tell.  Before, the fun has always been, "How much of [genre x] cliches and mash-ups can we cram into this session.<br/><br/>On the other end, how many games are really designed to capture the source material -- pulp or not?

I'm pretty sure it was always more complicated than that. Cyberpunk 2020 was never just "Hey! We're playing Neuromancer!" OD&amp;D was never just  "Hey! We're playing Conan!" In fact I'd say that Ron Edwards' "looking under the hood of the colour" is as old as role playing itself - the only difference is that he talks about it a whole lot and makes it explicit, whereas the first game designers didn't. <br/><br/>In other words there's always been a strong undercurrent of "capturing what the genre is about" in role playing games - it just hasn't really been a <i>stated</i> goal. (And it hasn't always necessarily been achieved - see Call of Cthulu or Middle Earth Role Playing; both great games which don't capture what the genre is about <i>at all</i>.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153456/#Comment_153456" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-27T18:47:33+00:00" title="June 27, 2008  6:47PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 27, 2008 6:48PM by Moreno R..">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems obvious, thinking about it, that games created with the express purpose of CREATING A KIND OF STORIES (can I say "narrativist" without being targeted by some inthaweb defense mechanism?) would contain essays (or at least some words) about what of human value these stories told us.  I disagree a little with Christopher about the scarcity of examples: there is <i>Sorcerer and Sword</i> for sword and sorcery, but there is <i>Sorcerer's Sould</i> and <i>Dirty Secrets</i> that talk a lot about crime fiction. <i>My Life with Master</i> contain, intersected with the rules, a deconstruction of the literature that talk about minions and masters.  Even the new edition of <i>Dust Devils</i> has a chapter about western movies. And <i>Spione</i> raised again the bar, with its treatment of "spy vs guy" fiction (and reality). So it's not something so rare in narrativist games.<br/><br/>What all these have in common is a focus on the heart of the literature, about "what they really talked about", and not on superficial genre trappings. This differentiate them from the awful lot of games that list hundreds of pages of meaningless details about some franchise: these are useful to create pastiches, imitations of the old works, not new stories.<br/><br/>(I am ignoring for simplicity the rather common case of game manuals that have BOTH, because this would mean opening the can of worms of the quality and quantity of the analysis in these books, that is very variable)<br/><br/>A possible reason of the lack, in pulp games, of a critical analysis about the genre, could be the focus on pastiche: to homage a genre, you have to homage the bad as the good, or your homage isn't truthful, isn't "on target".  This would differentiate their function from the one of <i> Sorcerer and Sword</i> rather drastically, and would render any comparation of dubious utility.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153457/#Comment_153457" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-27T18:52:36+00:00" title="June 27, 2008  6:52PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite><br/>What all these have in common is a focus on the heart of the literature, about "what they really talked about", and not on superficial genre trappings. </blockquote>\nBINGO!

Are you seriously asking for a game that tries to tell formulaic power fantasies with morals based on pre-WWII WASP ethics?<br/>\n<br/>\nI ask this because you mention, earlier in this thread, that you're looking for a way to dredge the good stuff out and take it to a more satisfying level for the reader of today's literature. Sax Rohmer was mentioned earlier, to which you talked about the aesthetic (by which you seem to mean the trappings of the literature: ie., the dinosaur islands and the thompsons.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's really the problem I run into with any "pulp" game, starting with GURPS: Cliffhangers. The aesthetics are really the most attractive part of the genre, for me. I never much cared for the stories, but I love Art Deco and modernist design and archetecture. Yet someone always has to pull out the pulp "morality" or sense of historical racism, sexism, jingoism or dualism and say you can't have a pulp game unless you work that crap in, to which I say "nuts!"<br/>\n<br/>\nI think maybe what you need to do, for a more adult approach to pulp, is take the trappings that you love and look to the other, more sophisticated writing going on at the same time. Starting low, you've got Raymond Chandler and film noir, you've got Wodehouse, you've got Evelyn Waugh, Erskine Caldwell, Steinbeck, Fitgerald... I mean, jeez, there's some good writing coming out of that period, not to mention early Richard Wright and Ralph Ellison.<br/>\n<br/>\nI keep seeing all this stuff that says "accept the social myopia as part of the genre," but what if you actually tried the reverse? What if you took some of these social issues, which still affect us today, and applied the trappings to them? I mean, what about dustbowl oakies taking a wrong turn into a lost valley of the dinosaurs and refusing to leave this good bottom land? What about the Ukridge company's disastrous investment in robot strikebreakers after the Invisible Men of Harlem, lead by Mr. Tumult, defeat this latest conspiracy?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, maybe that's a little too Alan Moore.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut you could at least try to present it as an alternate, spiffy solution to an ugly problem. Start with the ugly problem, and then pile on the masked men and gadgeteers. Maybe the players collaboratively choose one of these social issues, write up a few ways they rub them the wrong way and then, for a more extreme approach, write what inbuilt social ideal their own characters will have to overcome in order to deal with this mess in a just manner?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noisms" title="noisms"><img alt="noisms" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dragonsfoot.org/forums/download/file.php?avatar=7881_1233713790.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noisms">noisms</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153496/#Comment_153496" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-28T00:39:34+00:00" title="June 28, 2008 12:39AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>Hi Jean,<br/><br/>I never would think that people playing OD&amp;D thought they were playing Conan.

Earlier you said that older games were mostly about "Hey, we're playing X!" They were, but that was genre exploration too - just done in an intuitive, unspoken and unconscious way. When people were playing Cyberpunk 2020 they weren't consciously thinking "We're going to really get into what cyberpunk is about as a genre!" but they were probably actually doing so in an indirect way (as well as having fun with a game they liked, which is more to the point). <br/><br/>Maybe <i>Sorcerer and Sword</i> and similar are trying more explicitly to "do" a genre and get to grips with what it means, but I don't see a great difference between that and any other game of any genre from any era.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153533/#Comment_153533" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-28T08:28:06+00:00" title="June 28, 2008  8:28AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Jean,<br/><br/>Thanks for the reply.<br/><br/>Well, here we disagree.  I think I see what you're saying, but from my observations about play and from the texts, I'm not sure that the game Cyberpunk (fun game though it was, especially the character creation), did more than hand people mirrorshades and cyberware.  In my view (and it's just my view, and the way I like to play) if some thought isn't put into why or what a genre or game is "about" there most often won't be any "about" there.  <br/><br/>I don't think most people were interested in this, by the way.  That is, I don't think what Jesse ranted about, or that I agreed with, was a secret longing on the part of players that the games failed to deliver.  (It was an <i>open</i> longing on my part and some players, but we were the minority.)  Most people were happy to push around and explore the genre elements.  But to get at what Gibson and Sterling were up to, for example, would require approaching the books at fellow mechanics and looking under the hood of how the stories worked, what the themes were, and so on. <br/><br/>I want to add that this, too, is fun.  There is a great fun to having taken apart thematic concerns and then built them into games on purpose, with awareness of the players.  Games I've played that have delivered exactly this in spades are <i>Pendragon, Shock:, Primetime Adventures</i>, <i>Sorcerer, and Grey Ranks</i>, as well as a home brew Greg Gordon did using his DC Heroes game for a cool setting, some sessions I ran of AD&amp;D that pretty much blew off the rules. (That's MY list off the top of my head, early in the morning).<br/><br/>Now, I'm not saying people didn't do exactly as you're saying, and I'm sure there were some fucking awesome Cyberpunk games.  I mean that.  I'm saying that in most of con experiences, college year games and post college year games, most games were about nothing.  Pastiche genre elements mixed with some power fantasy and puzzle/problem solving was the bulk of the gameplay -- which is a good thing if that's what the players wanted!  I simply wasn't one of those players.  When I did hit a game that was about Issues (to reference a nearby and recent thread) the magic of RPGs hit for me.<br/><br/>Stories, if they're going to be interesting, have to have such issues woven into them.  We can often appreciate them as audience members even if we're not appreciating them intellectually.  The analogy I often use when talking to beginning writers is that we can enter the cool lobby of a building and be awed by the lovely marble, high atrium, and the skylight -- but never give a moment's thought to the support girders holding the building up.  But as a screenwriter, <i>you must be aware of those girders</i>.  In the same way, to build RGP sessions to have strong thematic content, the game and the players using the game should have, in my view, a little understand of how narrative works and so on.  (The games listed above all do, as so others.  There's nothing crazy or scary or no-fun going on here.)  <br/><br/>And if you're going to tap a genre, I think you need to see behind the marble and the skylight and get to some of the support girders.  Otherwise you often end up with what I saw: People in mirrorshades running around with guns and cyberware, who might as well been running around with guns in any setting.  Because strong genre elements are there to pictorially represent the thematic material underneath the picture.  Cyberpunk was about much more, and was more interesting than, "corps bad, cool outsiders good."  Even the guys who started the genre said it was pretty much over by the time it began and that everyone following after them were just grabbing the pictures and pasting them into stories to ride the gravy train.  If it can happen in the fiction, it can certainly happen in the games.<br/><br/>So, my point is this:  If one loves something, why not love it more by trying to understanding it?  Such an act of deeper reading of a genre doesn't remove any of the fun for the material.  It deepens one's understanding and appreciation for the material.  And if one wants to play a game to "recreate" or "tap" or, best of all, explore <i>more</i> deeply what one loves by bringing that material to an RPG session with friends, why not do it with more knowledge? <br/><br/>Now, I see that you're saying that was happening.  And, again, maybe it was.  Maybe people were successfully producing interesting thematic material in intuitive and unconscious ways by grabbing trope and cliches and images.  But I seldom saw it. <br/><br/>Given all that, can we agree that one's odds are <i>better</i> at producing thematically interesting content (and all the best work in the world is thematically interesting) if one does a little bit of work at understanding how the source material was constructed<i> and that's what one wants</i>?   That is the difference you said you're not seeing.  And in my view, bringing that effort to the table as a kind of creative-carpentry is a huge difference.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153537/#Comment_153537" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-28T08:39:41+00:00" title="June 28, 2008  8:39AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Robert's got a really good point, of course.  The reason people play Pulp the way pulp is often played is because the genre images are fun, but there might not be much else there.  <br/><br/>For the kind of effort Jesse is talking about, one must make decisions about what's worth pursuing.  Some materials or writers' work will be interesting enough to dig through, others will not.  At that point, the fun to be had is tossing visual pastiche in the blender (as Robert says).  If the images are strong and  (and crazy) enough, this is often it's own reward.  But the crazy ass fun of that is in <i>the act of creation</i>, not any kind of tale that is told by the group at the table.<br/><br/>I'm just going to remind everyone of <i>Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow</i>.  This is what Pulp Pastiche without actual Story and Thematic content looks like if you have to sit there and watch it.

I was in a cyberpunk game, set in NYC.  I was an ex-kickboxer (on the norm circuit...no enhancments) who got whacked for not taking a fall.  Built up with enhancements and forced to leave the sport he always loved.  Became a bodyguard.<br/><br/>It was using Hero system, so one little perk influenced the entire world.  I took Perk:  License to carry concealed weapon as a registered Bodyguard.  <br/><br/>What happen in play, was that the world was much more like our own.  NO running around shooting willy-nilly.  No firefights in Manhattan streets.  Violence was kept to the shadows, rare and .  I was special and different because I had clearence to pack on a crowded subway or a swank cocktail party.  The Cyber was there in the game.  The Punk was restrained and nuanced.  It was different and really neat.  Felt more like Chandler than Gibson.  <br/><br/>Thematically?  It was about one guy trying to do good in a very strange world of social constraint (High Society Cybered).  It was a solo game, just me as the PC.  Allowing us to tell that kinda story.<br/><br/>I *guess* the story could have been told as a Western or a 30s detective character, but the cyber elements... that plugged in corporate world, with the protagonist as a supporter but still an outsider, was very cool.  The GM was probably channeling a bit of his own corporate experiences...he works for a large bookchain at the HQ.  I was probably channeling some of my experiences as being a freelancer.  <br/><br/>To us, it was interesting.<br/><br/>But the issue of Pulp of the OP.  Taking out the "bad"... I don't buy it.  There is no bad.  Not for us.  I get SOOO much impact as a gamer from just one visual.  I also get impact from reading an entire Noam Chomksy book.  They are very different influences, but neither are "bad", even if the visual is a of a barbarian chick in a chainmail bikini fighting insect folk wielding arcane tridents. <br/><br/>For us gamers, it is the INSPIRATION that matters.  Whether it comes from E.E. Doc Smith's terrible writing, but cool ideas, or Michael Chabon's beautiful writing and cool ideas in Adventures of Cavalier and Clay about the Pulp days themselves.... doesn't matter.  The GM and/or Players got psyched about this little thing here or there... and bring it to the table to share... and fun and mayhem and excitement ensues.<br/><br/>Master of Kung Fu is one of my favorite comic books of all time.  Deals with racism pretty head on.  It couldn't exist without Fu Manchu, the father of the protagonist, the same Fu Manchu of Sax Rhoemer's very disturbing and dated views, but rollicking adventureous fun.  Sax influenced the folks at Marvel to come up with a great cast and great run of comics, despite low sales and mid-70s being a terriible time for comics in general.<br/><br/>I personally think Ron trimmed stuff out of Sorcerer and Sword that he should not have.  Nor did he pay attention to bits of the genre I think he should have.  But its been awhile since i've read them.  And I can't come up with specifics, just remembering going 'hey whattabout Leigh Brackett?  a damn fine writer.  whattabout John Jakes?  not a great writer, but a great storyteller..."  <br/><br/>But it was his book, his baby, he put his foot in the river where he thought he should to make the demarkation.<br/><br/>Still, inspiration has come to me from NPR radio, from lurid pulp covers, from conversations with mechanics, from terrible fantasy trilogies, from awesome fantasy trilogies.  It is all grist for the mill when we combine all those elements in a unique way at OUR tables.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153552/#Comment_153552" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-28T10:11:13+00:00" title="June 28, 2008 10:11AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thought:<br/><br/>Many (most?) mainstream RPGs present an undifferentiated pastiche that covers a broad swath of genre. D&amp;D includes nods to everything from Excalibur to Conan; Traveller is centered on Imperial-style scifi but does Lensmen pretty well too. And of course there's Exalted. It's one of the fundamental principles of trad RPG design -- put as much color into your game as will fit, and figure out how to rationalize it all into one setting.<br/><br/>My understanding of the reasoning behind that approach has always been a) to develop a creative setting not tied to any specific (and probably expensive) license or property and b) to provide such a big, colorful toolset that a DIY GM can pick and choose from to recreate the focused game he cares about.<br/><br/>Well, that was great back when DIY GMs were the norm. I'm not convinced they are anymore. Now you've got big, heavily developed settings where the pastiche isn't a toolset, it's the actual and complete setting. If you can't stomach including magical mecha in your Exalted game, you're leaving out a big piece of the canon setting. The canon has become more important than the toolset, and respecting the canon -- as any Internet forum will show you -- has at least as many ardent followers as old-skool DIY play.<br/><br/>So, sure. Pulp gaming revels in a genre-that-never-was when it throws together zombies, Not-zis, robots, Oriental mystics, masked vigilantes and American patriots. But including them all -- esp. in a SotC type of game -- is merely implied by the art. It's not mandated or IMO particularly expected by the game's text. There's even the step where you have to determine what your setting is generally focused on (weird science, magic, fisticuffs, futuristic, etc.). But it works perfectly well if everyone signs up for two-fisted patriots vs. protoNazis. Or gadgeteers vs. robots. Hell, it almost feels like more work to try and retcon Barsoom (say) into a game centered on the mean streets of Gotham.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog" title="Z-Dog"><img alt="Z-Dog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog">Z-Dog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153557/#Comment_153557" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-28T10:37:08+00:00" title="June 28, 2008 10:37AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            it's funny<br/>\n<br/>\nthere's stuff I get inspired by to try in games<br/>\n<br/>\nbut then there's what actually occurs in the game, and looking back, it's very different<br/>\n<br/>\nso we're trying to do straight Tolkien fantasy<br/>\n<br/>\nbut, looking back, we did really badly done espionage with moments of over-the-top Rambo action<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nmaybe we're tying to emulate certain genres and conventions, but I'm wondering: are there certain genres and conventions that are just easier to play/game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153561">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153561/#Comment_153561" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-28T11:11:00+00:00" title="June 28, 2008 11:11AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 28, 2008 2:02PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Storn,<br/><br/>You're reply to my reply to Jean's reply to my reply to Jesse's post reminds me why I find chat boards often so troublesome as a tool of communication.  It's a like a game of Telephone where we all make pretend we've been talking about the same thing the whole time, when in fact the conversation and subject is shifted with each person's point of view, experience and concerns.<br/><br/>Which is my way of saying that the game you described sounded awesome.  I was lighting up reading your write up thinking, "Man, I wish I'd played in that."<br/><br/>But I had been addressing Jesse's points about specifically building out of specific genre or story (or set of stories).  As you yourself say in your post, that wasn't the intent of the game you played (and there's no reason it should have).  We're talking about lots of different things now.  "Inspiration" is the subject you're bringing up.  Jesse's first post is about... mmmm... I don't even know what word to use.  "Emulation" would be wrong, because there's no point in simply "re-doing" a kind of fiction.  But sometimes there's something about a story of type of fiction and, I don't know, you're not done with it, or there's more to be done with it, or something.<br/><br/>As an example, I think this is the case of Greg Stafford and <i>Pendragon</i>.  The man really, really believes that in those myths there's something really, really valuable for all of us.  He went after a game not to "do King Arthur" again, but because he thought a game that served as a delivery system for those myths, a means for us to interact with them would be of great value.  <br/><br/>I woke up this morning, conflating this thread with the nearby "Tell me about King Arthur PENDRAGON" thread and thought, "You probably can't play that game well without reading Thomas Mallory first."  That's the kind of thing I'm talking about here.  That there something in the fiction that has to rub a nub in our brains when we hit the fiction that might prompt someone to ask, "Do you have an itch from reading that fiction? Is there something else you want to do with it?  Is there more to explore in the act of that fiction?"  I'm not talking the "I play RPGs so I can do the smart thing and make the right choices the characters in books and movies never make" line of logic.  Stafford built a game where the PCs would be making <i>exactly</i> the same mistakes the knights in Mallory make.  Why is that?  Not to recreate the genre, but to have the Players sink into the fiction directly and experience it again, in a new light, more directly than they even can as readers of the book.<br/><br/>I think Ron Edwards was after the same thing with Sorcerer &amp; Sword.  That's why he was judicious in his book and author selection.  Because he wasn't after inspiration or source material.  He was after specific qualities of <i>weird</i> sword &amp; sorcery fiction -- qualities that he truly believe are worth delving into deeper.<br/><br/>But all this is different than grabbing at color and tropes for inspiration and visual substance for tales.  You're right -- we grab at anything we can.  We should!  But both Stafford and Edwards picked and chose which stories and which authors and which kinds of stories and what qualities of these stories that mattered.  I think this is what Jesse was talking about when he started.<br/><br/><br/>I'll close by saying I'm not sure simply doing a detailed under the hood game write up for any given genre makes any sense.  I don't think it can be done as an exercise.  It must be done, as touched on above, as an element of the <i>obsessive</i> for it to make any sense or to work.  Stafford and Edwards really love the stuff of the fiction they went after, and in particular the stuff under the hood of that fiction.  I think this quality of real, sincere interest <i>must</i> be present for the kind of work Jesse is talking about.  And, in turn, the Players must already have an interest or a deeper buy-in to the material as well to make it work.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153582/#Comment_153582" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-28T13:54:05+00:00" title="June 28, 2008  1:54PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Posted By: Z-Dogit's funny<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nmaybe we're tying to emulate certain genres and conventions, but I'm wondering: are there certain genres and conventions that are just easier to play/game?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think certain conventions and genres certainly seem less intimidating.

I think I see what you're saying, but from my observations about play and from the texts, I'm not sure that the game Cyberpunk (fun game though it was, especially the character creation), did more than hand people mirrorshades and cyberware.  In my view (and it's just my view, and the way I like to play) if some thought isn't put into why or what a genre or game is "about" there most often won't be any "about" there.<br/></blockquote>\nI think part of what Jean is getting at is that in the case of many of these games, it <i>was</i> the designers' intent to explore the themes central to the genre and get at what it was all about, but that at the time, hard-coding such things into the rules was largely seen as undesirable.  Typically, games of the time were designed to allow thematically appropriate play, but would only push the game in that direction indirectly.  Forcing of genre was left to the gamemaster, because forcing groups to play a particular way would be "wrong."  This attitude is still pretty prevalent among mainstream gamers.<br/><br/>I think this is unquestionably true of Mike Pondsmith's design of Cyberpunk.  Pondsmith is a dedicated fan of the genre, and often has sensible and intelligent things to say which I think display a sound understanding of the themes and significance of the literature, but he also has a design bias toward wide open toolkit games that are dependent on gamemaster control and the players 'behaving themselves' for genre emulation to work.  Games are going to be thematically appropriate because everyone at the table works together to make it so, and because the gamemaster punishes inappropriate play.  You see this thinking everywhere in Pondsmith's GMing advice, and throughout the rules themselves.  <br/><br/>For instance, If you look at the Roles in Cyberpunk 2020, many of them can not work together in play, and some require campaigns built around them in order to function at all.  This is barely even mentioned in the rules; the GM is supposed to handle it on his own, and the players are expected to be sensible about conceiving and building their characters.  The roles are there to support the widest possible variety of genre-appropriate games.<br/><br/>To come back to my point, I think games like Cyberpunk and Call of Cthulhu were designed with serious thought toward capturing what the genre was truly about, but that the state of the art and the prevailing prejudices in game design at the time did not really permit tackling such things head on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153628/#Comment_153628" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-28T19:29:47+00:00" title="June 28, 2008  7:29PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Um, no one? ;) Go play Dust Devils.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat's relevant about Dust Devils?

I think hard-coding the exploration of themes into games is a good and valid thing to do, but at the same time I appreciate that the older games left such things open. If you really wanted to explore the themes of cyberpunk literature with Cyberpunk 2020 you could do; but at the same time, if you just wanted to have a fun game assassinating Mr. Joneses and trying to shoot cyborgs with railguns while wearing mirrorshades, you could do that too.

I'd love to see a return to more expansive game design -- but with stronger/clearer guidelines about the best ways, and reasons, to pick and choose from among all the setting craziness one might find. Pointing out that including, say, both dinosaurs and robots in your pulp game might lead your sessions to focusing on the zaniness of the setting and not the themes you actually care about. <br/><br/>(To be fair, SotC gives this approach the best shot of just about any game I've ever read. Unfortunately, the default gameworld is already set at maximum zaniness -- IMO most gamers aren't as comfortable moving away from the default settings as they used to be.)<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153700/#Comment_153700" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-29T11:58:56+00:00" title="June 29, 2008 11:58AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noisms</cite><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite><br/>After all, a game is better if it "allow" you to do MORE THINGS!  :-P</blockquote>\n<i>Reductio ad absurdum.</i>.<br/><br/>No. Irony.  ;-)<br/><br/>Caused, in part, from your use of the words "a RPG that LET YOU DO...",  something that really disturb me in his widespread acceptance in gamedom (If I can play anything rule-less - and I do - how can a game allow me to do anything that I couldn't do without it? Even if you say that you want rules, I could use a similar ruleset, or simply write rules for it myself. There is no prohibition to play, for example, pulp stories, if you don't have a game that "allow you to do it". What I want is game that HELP ME in playing these. It can seem a invisible difference, but it's really evident in play. I can't count the games I know that at most "allow you" to play, but don't really help you do it at all.)\n<blockquote>I'm not saying games should allow<i>anything</i>. But why be restrictive if you can help it? What's wrong with having a cyberpunk game which allows both cheap cyberpunk thrills and also genre exploration depending on your mood and preferred play style?</blockquote>\nNothing. But only IF adding support for another playstyle don't affect at all the level of support for the fist playstyle.  Something that in your post you take as a given, but I have a lot of doubts about. Or, I could say, I have even observed in practice DON'T WORK.<br/><br/>My example was ironic, but more functional than your true proposal. Adding 200 pages about something completely different is only, at most, wasted pages and and higher price. But the games don't overlap at all, so these 200 added pages don't "ruin" the first ones.<br/><br/>But you talk about thematic content and obsessive collections of details as if it was a matter of adding 1+1.  A chapter about all the little details, and a chapter about the thematic content. But in this case, both chapters would talk about THE SAME THINGS, seen by two very different point-of-views.  When you write a chapter about x, you talk about how much it weight, it's "powers", how much it does cost, or do you talk about what does it MEAN? Are you so sure that you can talk about both things at the same time?<br/><br/>And what about the rules? Are you so sure that the exact same rules can help the players do both?<br/><br/>For example, let's look a the rules about guns in DitV.  In that game, only guns can kill a player character outright. No matter if the NPC is using a old rusty gun that don't even work anymore most of the times, and he could have used instead 500lb of explosives, an axe, fire or poison. Only guns in that game have a fallout of d10s. More than that, if you go to gunfighting, you can roll other stats. It's considered an escalation over any other weapon.<br/>It's clear that this rule address the MEANING of guns, as the ultimate bringers of death and violence in the setting. <br/>Would these rules work well if you want instead a game where you rate every single gun produced by Smith &amp; Wesson or Daniel Colt in their history, keeping tracks of their stopping power, ease of use, rate of recharge, number of chambers, precision, range, recoil and chance of  misfiring?<br/><br/>Would a rule system where you keep track of all these things work as well as DitV in a game about the thematic meaning of a gun?<br/><br/>You see, you did use a "the more, the merrier" approach to game systems, taking for granted something very similar to the old "with this system, I can play anything" ---&gt; "system doesn't matter". It's an assumption most of the rpg culture take for granted. Even if it was demonstrated as false, again, again, and again, any single time it was used in a game system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153724/#Comment_153724" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-29T14:42:09+00:00" title="June 29, 2008  2:42PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 29, 2008 2:47PM by Matt Snyder.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Roby</cite><br/>(Matt, this is where you jump in and tell us what the sources were.)</blockquote>\nReally?

Distill the various types of stories in the genre down to their foundational elements and then make the game about that. If not, what would those games have to look like?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153737/#Comment_153737" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-29T17:34:11+00:00" title="June 29, 2008  5:34PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I certainly prefer games that encourage as opposed to restrict.

I always viewed the "everything and the kitchen sink" approach pulp games took to be offering alternative takes rather than "you must have all of this in your games." I figure if combining peanut butter and salami makes the folks at the table turn green, then you just don't do it, even if the menu would allow you to make that combination. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>As someone else has said, <i>Justice, Inc.</i>, despite having come out in the mid-80s, handles the pastiche element pretty well. The game came with a rulebook and a setting book, and the latter had a brief discussion of all the different genres pulp includes and how you might mix them. "Just do all of it" wasn't their take on it at all. For example, one of the sample adventures in the book (a haunted house setpiece based mostly on untangling this odd family's R-Map, hehe) is written so that you can run it with or without supernatural elements. (One bit I really liked is that the adventure offered how to run it if the ghost is real, a hoax to steal a family inheritance, or both, and the "combo" approach is pretty deftly written.)<br/><br/>So I admit that that particular book is probably where I got my take on how to "do pulp". Now that I think about it, there's a lot of things rattling around in my head from old Hero sourcebooks I read as a teenager. Ah, <i>Danger International</i>, the only RPG that told you how to do A-Team, V, 007, and The Road Warrior, right out of the box. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153758/#Comment_153758" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-29T21:17:59+00:00" title="June 29, 2008  9:17PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>I don't think Dust Devils is a dead-on delve into pulp westerns. Importantly, there are plenty of pulp westerns where the heroes (or antiheros) never face up to any particular inner driving force, let alone have that as the center of their story. Not that Dust Devils is bad, it's very very good. It's just focused very tightly (pacing, characters, plot, etc.) on a very particular sort of story arc. </blockquote>\nOk, I'm back. But, I don't think to derail. After thinking on it some more, I don't think I'm cool with the idea that Dust Devils is "just one kind" of Western. I think this is actually tied in to what Jesse and Christopher are discussing. <br/><br/>Specifically, I cannot come up with a single Western story or film that DOESN'T have elements of what Dust Devils helps players create. Maybe they're out there? But, um, they're the BAD ones. Sort of like what Jesse is talking about with Pulp and the kitchen-sink-include-the-bad-ones, too. <br/><br/>Every single one I can think of does indeed have protagonists "face up to any particular driving force." I think that pigeon holing Dust Devils as that one kind of gritty Sergio Leone fellatio-fest is sorely lacking in imagination and experience playing the game. It is much more robust than this. This isn't aimed at JD specifically, really. I really don't think he's the kind of role-player who's bound to agree with me or particularly enjoy Dust Devils as I do. Which is fine. But, neither do I think he's pegged Dust Devils very well. <br/><br/>So, Christopher and Jesse, I wasn't kidding. It does what you're talking about with the genre of the Western. It gets under the hood, tosses color out on its ear (and then invites it back in its proper role later), and helps players actually craft that "magic" that Christopher's after. After a couple years reading your guys' posts about your interests in gaming, I'm sort of baffled how little you appear to recognize it. Maybe not your cup of tea, which is cool. I do think it's worth a look, of course! And, sure, that's me as fucking selfish as I can get. But, hey, I think it's relevant here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153826/#Comment_153826" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-30T09:21:45+00:00" title="June 30, 2008  9:21AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Snyder</cite>Specifically, I cannot come up with a single Western story or film that DOESN'T have elements of what Dust Devils helps players create.

Some of the ones I'm thinking about are very exciting action-and-romance fests with plenty of shooting and riding around and women swooning and such. We can't all be McCabe and Mrs. Miller (which is not Leone-esque, by the by).  Some of us have to be Silver Canyon, or worse, The Border Boys Across the Frontier. Nobody really faces up to anything in particular internally in those, and internal demons SURE as hell don't even remotely come close to driving the story as centrally as the Devil does in a Dust Devils game, but they're rip-roaring adventure of various degrees just the same. Besides, who says what is "bad" in the literary sense is "bad" in the story gaming sense? Remember JDCorley's Law of Licensed Gaming: Bad source material means good gaming.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Roby</cite>And I think this clears up further when you recognize that Matt's verdict of "bad" is wholly subjective, as is Ron's when it comes to sword-and-sorcery.
