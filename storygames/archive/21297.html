Here's the actual <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RGkAK6SER3tvhM-m9Mzu6f_P2iEbF6vB11seyDYtpFk/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">[section on Abilities]</a>, if you want to see it.<br/><br/>In the original version, players could freeform create Abilities during chargen. While this sounds simple, in practice it ended up being the slowest and most difficult part of the process. Furthermore, IME players often created Abilities that had a ton of color but very little practical use, and as such mostly just ended up sitting on the character sheet.<br/><br/>For the tMW revision, I want to include a list of Abilities that players can choose from. In the text, these Abilities will be defined by their narrative effect/ special action, though during chargen players will need to elaborate on the exact form that the Ability will take for the character. They will also be mutually exclusive between ronin.<br/><br/><i>Here\u2019s what I want y\u2019all to think about:</i> <br/>1) Look at the following list and tell me if there are potential Abilities you think I\u2019m missing or would otherwise be good to add. Are there any I should take out? Should I rename any?<br/><br/>2) Tell me if you have any cool elaborations/ descriptions/ examples for the various Abilities.<br/><br/>Bonus) Read the linked file up above and look up the section on \u201cAssumed Abilities\u201d. Tell me if you think there are any missing or if there are any I should take away.\n<blockquote><b>Abilities List</b><br/><i>Note that the categories won\u2019t be included in the final version.</i><br/><br/><i>(Attacks)</i><br/><b>Missile Fire</b>: Grants the ability to attack at a long distance.<br/>     Ex.: Bow &amp; Arrow, Musket or Matchlock Pistol, Shuriken<br/><b>Explosives</b>: Grants an exploding attack, including the ability to damage large scale structures.<br/>     Ex.: Bombs, Fireworks<br/><br/><i>(Enhanced Traits)</i><br/><b>Enhanced Sight</b>: Grants the ability to see at great distances, or alternatively, to see through or around obstructions.<br/>     Ex.: Eyes of a Hawk, Mirror of Seeing<br/><b>Blindsight</b>: Grants the ability \u201csee\u201d without light or normal means of vision.<br/>     Ex.: Nightvision, Sonar, Blind Vision.<br/><b>Enhanced Perception</b>: Grants the ability to sense things in the surrounding environment that a normal character could not.<br/>     Ex.: Senses of a Wolf, Sixth Sense<br/><b>Extraordinary Strength</b>:<br/>     Ex.: Strong like an Ox<br/><br/><i>(Movement)</i><br/><b>Leaping</b>: Allows the character to leap, glide, or even fly through the air.<br/>     Ex.: Wushu Leaping, Flying<br/><b>Teleportation</b>: Grants the ability to teleport short distances, or alternatively, to pass through various barriers.<br/>     Ex.: Travel through Shadows, Pass through Walls<br/><br/><i>(Deception/ Influence)</i><br/><b>Enhanced Stealth</b>: Allows a character to conceal their presence.<br/>     Ex.: Moves like a Ninja, Camouflage into Surroundings, Shapeshift into Inanimate Objects<br/><b>Disguise</b>: Grants the ability to change one\u2019s appearance, including the potential to impersonate another individual.<br/>     Ex.: Transform One\u2019s Face, Disguise Kit<br/><b>Influence</b>: Grants the ability to influence another character\u2019s thinking or emotions<br/>     Ex.: Mind control, Voice that can incite emotion<br/><b>Illusionism</b>: Allows the character to control another individual\u2019s perceptions.<br/>     Ex.:<br/><br/><i>(Practical)</i><br/><b>Rope</b>: <br/>     Ex.: Rope &amp; Grappling Hook, Create Spider Web<br/><b>Climbing</b>: Grants the ability to scale sheer surfaces.<br/>     Ex.: Climbs like a Spider, Climbing Claws &amp; Spikes<br/><b>Light</b>: <br/>     Ex.: Torch or Lantern, Jeweled Necklace of Holy Light<br/><b>Tracking</b>: <br/>     Ex.: Tracking, Compass that always points to the object of your thoughts<br/><i><br/>(Perception/ Communication)</i><br/><b>Perceive and Communicate with the Dead</b>:<br/>     Ex.: Talk with the Dead, See the Dead<br/><b>Visions</b>: Grants the ability to have \u201cspiritual\u201d visions or otherwise to project their consciousness to another location. <br/>     Ex.: Astral Projection, Travel to the land of the Dead <br/><b>Read a Person/ Situation</b>:<br/>     Ex.: Detect Lies, Read Emotions, Detect Magic<br/><b>Communication</b>: Allows the character to communicate with others over long distances.<br/>     Ex.: Telepathic, Seashells that characters can speak through<br/><br/><i>(Magic/Weird)</i><br/><b>Telekinesis</b>: The ability to move or otherwise control objects and people.<br/>     Ex.:<br/><b>Elemental Magic</b>: Must pick an element.<br/>     Ex.: Summon Fire, Storm Fan, Control/ Build Stone </blockquote>\nThanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466455/#Comment_466455" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-21T20:10:15+00:00" title="September 21, 2017  8:10PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's quite a complete list!

I really can't imagine a Player translating his PC's "fast travel ability" into something like "<i>I have a horse</i>". Maybe rename them as "Traits" or "Aspects" or something? I mean, you yourself start by explaining that:<br/>"<i>The term \u201cAbility\u201d is used loosely, however, as these <b>traits</b> may encompass any character <b>aspect</b> that broadens a PC\u2019s normal capabilities.</i>"<br/><br/>- - -<br/>- -<br/>-<br/><br/>2)<br/>I can see how just offering a blank page to Players and then asking them to come up with whatever power/skill/item can end up taking too much time and effort.<br/>But switching from that to a list of specific "power functions" that THEN also need to be translated into specific fiction seems... inefficient?<br/><br/>Depending on your design goals you might want to consider two options.<br/><br/>A)<br/>You go the Apocalypse World way and use the ability list as <b>a passive way to enforce setting</b>, by which I mean that ALL abilities have to be specifically very flavourful and unique to the setting, so that a Player that is not familiar with your intended colour ends up creating an appropriately coloured PC no matter what ... but then you should get rid of bland/generic things like "Read a Person" or "Telekinesis".<br/><br/><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/><br/>You use the abilities as an <b>expressive tool</b> for Player to come up with their unique PC, like you did in the past, but this time you add more structure to it in order to make the process more accessible and expedite.<br/>The idea is be to make the procedures more explicit and guided, so that you can also enforce variety (which seems to be the case, from your imagining Abilities as items, skills, powers).<br/><br/>An idea from the top of my head would be this:<br/>- keep only the categories (Attack, Movement, Perception, Deception, Utility, Magic, etc... maybe review and reconsider which categories you care for most, or are most desirable, and only keep those)<br/>- instruct the Player to pick two different categories<br/>- instruct the Player to pick, for each chosen category, either the Item or Skill or Power descriptor<br/>- instruct the Player to now describe in their own words how their two abilities look like in the fiction<br/>- you may then supplement practical examples of what a Movement-Item or Attack-Power or Deception-Skill could mean for a character<br/><br/>You could add more steps to add setting-unique details to each ability, to help Players incorporate elements they might otherwise not think about (spirits, animals, elements, ninja-stuff, etc).<br/><br/>I would then not sweat about tactical minutiae like "range". You don't really need traditional "balance" with this kind of tools.

In other words, they're all about doing stuff, the external form is just color.<br/><br/>I do hear you, though, it's a thing I've thought about in the past. But in the end I decided to just leave it.<br/>\n<blockquote>I can see how just offering a blank page to Players and then asking them to come up with whatever power/skill/item can end up taking too much time and effort.<br/>But switching from that to a list of specific "power functions" that THEN also need to be translated into specific fiction seems... inefficient?</blockquote>\nThat's also something I've thought about. At one point I considered listing the various Abilities and then telling players they could <i>only</i> choose one of the official examples/interpretations.<br/><br/>My suspicion---or maybe, my hope---is that ~80% of players will just select one of the official variations. (And in that way, I can use the Abilities list as a passive description of setting. That's already something I'm working on.) But I suspect that some players, especially those who have played the game before, will want to re-color the Abilities to better fit their vision of their character. Thus I feel I need the slightly awkward procedure of "select an Ability (basic effect/action) and then describe what it looks like for your character."<br/><br/>I wonder if explaining it differently will help?<br/>\n<blockquote>drop the long explanation about Assumed Abilities.<br/>Just say that each PC has the same fundamental Ability/Trait/Aspect called "Ronin" which includes all the things a ronin is supposed to be capable of and be in possession of</blockquote>\nThat's exactly what I did in the original version, but I had someone suggest I should outline it more.

The best way to handle abilities in a game like this is to allow players to create them on the fly and then narrate how the character acquired the skill in the past. 3:16 does this with Flashbacks.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
