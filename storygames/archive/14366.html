Just looking at your parameters though I can't help but think that it sounds very much like a superhero game. At least the way superhero games would work if they really held to the comic books. Maybe you can mine some supers games for useful tidbits? Hell, just a re-skinning/re-theming might work for the right game, plus a few specific tweaks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_326786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Parke" title="Parke"><img alt="Parke" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v97/mikker/Zoosmell.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Parke">Parke</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326786/#Comment_326786" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-28T15:24:15+00:00" title="May 28, 2011  3:24PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Love Archer, here are some quick ideas.<br/><br/>I think the resolution system should be entirely "yes, but" based.

Every character doesn't give a crap about the important things going on, only the small things important to them. You need to have a mechanical weight for those things:<br/>"You throw him over the side of the balcony, but he rips your suit." "GODDAMNIT."<br/><br/>I'm not sure how to enforce continuity...maybe something like an "owe list" but for NPCs, subplots, and gags. You write them down and have to bring one back in the next game or something like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326788">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326788/#Comment_326788" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-28T15:41:14+00:00" title="May 28, 2011  3:41PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Parke</cite><br/>I think the resolution system should be entirely "yes, but" based.

A system that only says "Yes, but" would pretty well create a crazy, rambling, Frisky Dingo type story, where no ideas are rejected, but just built upon.  (Some amount of "Yes but..." would go toward dealing with the continuity issue.)<br/><br/>I'm very interested in how Robert deals with these sorts of things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_326798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326798/#Comment_326798" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-28T19:21:57+00:00" title="May 28, 2011  7:21PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This "yes, but" shit is ingenious.

Since the characters tend to haul off and get really good at violence once their buttons have been pushed enough, it seems like giving bonuses to losing your shit should be given out after a certain But threshold.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
