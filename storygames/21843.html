This came from the idea of sabotaging the brakes and direction of any storygame, so I think it is in the spirit of the thread. Except I include lore and lore spouting in it, which I think is compelling for some players and appropriately infuriating for others. The end result is mini-games or techniques to cater to various types of players (or give written crutches in case these player are absent). Some are picked from Push vol.1 I associate the various techniques to the typology of players from the WotC RPG survey. Here's a link <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=18guqC5gRihHLdkPOehyZGqOuboS0Rjau" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://drive.google.com/open?id=18guqC5gRihHLdkPOehyZGqOuboS0Rjau</a><br/><br/>They are written with a "each and every player" focus which is not compulsory, just fair. I don't see how making it an individual move vs collective would change their nature. Maybe just to signal that the quorum/veto ratio may be higher for this kind of moves than for the rest of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_477352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moconnor" title="moconnor"><img alt="moconnor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/483/n3W81Z19PQYI6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moconnor">moconnor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477352/#Comment_477352" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-10-30T12:52:00+00:00" title="October 30, 2018 12:52PM">October 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The link was an interesting read overall, but the idea of a character sheet that turns inside out to reveal a transformed player role is brilliant.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477358/#Comment_477358" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-10-30T19:03:55+00:00" title="October 30, 2018  7:03PM">October 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 30, 2018 7:04PM by Nathan_H.">edited October 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/moconnor" rel="nofollow">moconnor</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The link was an interesting read overall, but the idea of a character sheet that turns inside out to reveal a transformed player role is brilliant.</p></div></blockquote>\n<img alt="image" src="https://i.imgur.com/ZmJVA3S.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_477365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477365/#Comment_477365" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-10-31T12:56:06+00:00" title="October 31, 2018 12:56PM">October 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After reading this, I feel compelled to write a GMless Dread / Archipelago mashup game.

This is escalation for me because the game is very open and when the players accept to engage in some of the mini-games, they suddenly get a hard constraint (facts, maps, mood, etc.) in addition to the problems they already have to solve (creativity and strategy). <br/><br/>These techniques are generally valid so I thought they could be of use to anyone. For this game and others, I have brought into play Actor, Thinker and Storyteller techniques already, without difficulty.  I never dared to use the "Take that !" questions, but the tickling is there from the start : as the facilitator, I just can't be the first to shoot. Now it's written in the rules, we'll see. <br/>I have a hard time finding <span style="text-decoration: underline;">numerical</span> resource management compatible with my game. Only <a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> luggage game fits the bill. The "script" and "declare" mood techniques are still very theoretical for me, as I don't aim at an "improv workshop" feel. The patina of time will make these slide into place hopefully.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481326/#Comment_481326" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-26T11:59:27+00:00" title="March 26, 2019 11:59AM">March 26</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21611/5e-inventory-sheet/p1" rel="nofollow">\u2665luggage game\u2665</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
