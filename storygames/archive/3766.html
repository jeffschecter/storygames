When I played the game I got annoyed because there were other things in or surrounding the scene that were more interesting to me than character goals.</br></blockquote>\nHmmm. Maybe that was a communication problem of the book, or perhaps a personal thing of the producer? I've played 2 PTA full-length campaigns, and a number of one-shots: For the one-shots, sure we tend to "drive towards issue", but in the longer games we totally take time to smell the roses.  The issues may come up once or twice in the episode, but since they don't have to be resolved but once per season, unless you're aiming for After-School Special or Oxygen Channel Tear-Jerker, there's no reason to constantly force focus on issues/goals.\n<blockquote>How the otherwise elegant my life with master and dogs in the vinyards re-legitimized weird dice in indie rpgs.</blockquote>\nI'm a dice fetishist, so I disagree. I wish more indie games used d8s and d12s, actually.\n<blockquote>The \xe2\u20ac\u02dcanti-golden rule\xe2\u20ac\u2122 in timestream which says something like- don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t change the rules, play as written or don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t play at all</blockquote>\nYeah, if that's what it says I agree it's pretty silly. I support at least one playthrough without changing rules just so you don't, y'know, show up somewhere saying "I played X and it sucked! It totally fell apart!" and on further probing discover that you didn't even use half the rules, and another quarter were changed. I've seen at least three infamous threads at RPGNet like this.<br><br/>But outside of that... I've run about six TSOY games or campaigns, and only one of them was using the original world.\n<blockquote>Burning empire\xe2\u20ac\u2122s tight focus \xe2\u20ac\u201c I want multiple modes of play/mini games given its length</blockquote>\nI can get behind that. I still haven't gotten through one campaign of Game as Written yet, so I can't talk. However, I think it would be cool for a BE fan -slash- fan of the graphic novel, if they would, y'know, put together an alternative play structure for another type of campaign.  Sure, the scene rules and world burner focus purely on the Vaylen, but with a little tweaking from a fan of the system and the rules, I can see them being used for Something Else: A kingmaker setting or something, perhaps. I haven't read the comics, though, so I can't say much more on that.\n<blockquote>Fudge dice in general since they seem to cancel each other out so why did I roll? I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve only used them in 2nd ed the shadow of yesterday</blockquote>\nWell, the thing there is that most games do this:<br/>You start at 0. You add your skill, say "7". Then you roll your dice, be it 2d6, 1d10, whatever.<br/>With Fudge/FATE/other, you start at your skill level, say "7", and the dice determine how far up or down you go.<br/>I dig it, but recently I've been interested in "numberier" systems. \n<blockquote>Bad art in a bunch of games, 1st ed dread book of pandemonium and dead inside come to mind ( I like modern design so most comic bookish characters in action art turns me off as well)</blockquote>\nI can get behind that. What good layout has shown us over the past few years is that you can make a book visually stimulating and catchy, and easy to read in terms of presentability, if you put more time and research into the layout. Unfortunately, we have grown up in a culture where, "Nah, you can get the same effect by throwing in pictures here and there instead" is the norm. But double-plus-awesome layout is far cheaper to buy than awesome art.\n<blockquote>$12-$20 prices for some games that are fairly small products based around good but simple ideas; games that fit this category probably include gingerbread men, cats, 1001 nights. I\xe2\u20ac\u2122d like to see more of these in the $5 or $10 range (bacchanal is a nice, affordable counter example)</blockquote>\nWhile I can get behind that, I also do not want to make general assessments of what people should or should not do with their work.  I personally have made decisions based on that kind of thinking, though. I have a copy of Bacchanal somewhere. But there are some games that, while apparently awesome, just haven't breached the limit where I would feel like putting my pesos on the table for it.\n<blockquote>faith-based stuff in intros like legends of alyria (not that authors should hide their beliefs, I'll just react negatively to some of them)</blockquote>\nPersonally, I love it. I bought LoA because of two things:<br/>1) Clinton ranted on about it, and told me a brief rundown of the setting (namely the Ark).<br/>2) I heard that it's a game with no Grey, but black and white Good and Evil, with Christian undertones (well, not really, just more a focus on Real Good and Real Evil).<br/>For me, it was a selling point. Mind you that I'm not Christian. Also, despite liking a few Deicide tunes, I'm not anti-Christian either. In that regard, to make an analogue, it was like reading a game set in a Fantasy Korea written by a native Korean. Or a game that takes place in a far future where there's a giant Polish empire, written by a Polack. That sort of thing.<br/>It just felt refreshing. If that ends up costing Seth some sales, I'm sure he's cool with that.<br/><br/>For me, I can't think of too many things that I don't like in games in general, and honestly it's hard at this point to seperate X from game Y for me and say "Game Y would be awesome but for Rule X".  For me, my offputting experiences with story games mainly come from GM/player mistakes or misreads. Namely, these two:<br/><br/>* Player: Pushes too hard. Goes too gonzo. Other players, y'know, don't call foul because it's just a liiiittle over the top (be it "I build a ziggurat out of human corpses!" or "I find where your character works and I do something to fuck up your PC's relationships! Rawr!" (that is, both general gonzoness, and gonzoness that's directed at messing with another character as "hard choices")). But after a while, the game's feeling totally changes because one person was pushing too hard without paying attention to the others, or Making Them Cool. This has happened in a few games I've been in, perhaps 3.<br/><br/>* GM: Forces too much "Get to the Conflict".  I've been in maybe two games where, y'know, we're doing a scene. Players are playing their roles. We're gradually getting into it, talking in character, finding some concensus and gradually leading to a direction when... The GM cuts in and says "OH! That's a conflict right there!" or "Let's get to the conflict!"  Perhaps it's a cross between not having enough time (if it's a 1-shot con style game), and just the GM getting the jitters and thinking that he has to jump in and do something to make the game exciting/fun/other. But I'm into role-playing, and not so much "ok roleplay (3 seconds pass) STOP! Let's find a conflict! Roll! Resolve! Take consequences!  OK, scene ends!"<br/><br/>-Andy                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84435/#Comment_84435" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-31T18:45:29+00:00" title="July 31, 2007  6:45PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 31, 2007 6:50PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure -- how do I say this.... I think there's value in stating why you had a problem with a game.  <br/><br/><br/>1) For example, it might provoke a discussion on why a certain system works well, or not, and how to make it better.<br/><br/><br/>2) It also might flush out some confusion for people about game rules, that might lead to a discussion about the game that clarifies something. <br/><br/>For example, Nancy asks about <i>DitV</i>, "Who trusts a rogue?"  To which the answer is, "Well, that's the point. What the societal norm <i>is</i> is up for grabs in every game."  So, I think, there's probably much more range for actions and effectiveness than your imagining, Nancy.  You can't play a Dog "right."  You can only play her the way you want to.<br/><br/>And Mark V suggested that the scenes in <i>PtA</i> focus on the Character's goals in the scene.  Now, I've been in a game where the GM made this the focus.  But I think this leads to dull scenes.  I think, and I believe this is backed up in the text, the focus is on the Character's <i>Issues</i>.  Which leads to a whole lot of cool stone turning over revealing bugs and stuff.<br/><br/>Now, both of these points are for other threads (if not other boards -- I don't know). But they do reveal a confusion that's going to gum up play, make play not fun, and suggest "No, thanks," to people looking at the games.<br/><br/><br/>3) That all said, there's a certain tossed salad quality to the lists.  If people are willing to see it as folks just throwing out anything that comes to mind, then it might not be a big deal.  <br/><br/>But if folks are going to look at each item on the list as some sort of attack on their game, or a game they love, or the game a friend of theirs designed, then yeah, it's going to get icky fast.<br/><br/><br/>Tony, I don't see any off this a justification, and certainly not of putative flaws. (I mean Mark complains that <i>Mu</i> uses <i>Sorcerer</i>'s rules instead of new rules -- because he doesn't know <i>Sorcerer</i> because he'd have to learn the rules.... But apparently he wouldn't mind learning new rules that aren't <i>Sorcerer</i>? I mean, i can't make heads or tails of that. But it's on his mind, so there it is.)<br/><br/>But, that said, I don't see 90% of these having anything to do with heartbreakers or not. Like stream water soil in a prospectors pan, maybe something shine will come out of it. <br/><br/>I don't know. But as long as people keep perspective, there might not be too much harm.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/markv" title="markv"><img alt="markv" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/markv">markv</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84447/#Comment_84447" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-31T19:26:34+00:00" title="July 31, 2007  7:26PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 31, 2007 7:29PM by markv.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite>I'm curious about what the purpose of this thread might be.</blockquote>\nthere were requests in the heartbreaker thread for people to be direct and say what games they thought were storygame heartbreakers<br/><br/>no one would, so I thought I'd try<br/><br/>but since I don't think of games as heartbreakers, rather as games with some good and some bad, my post ended up as is<br/><br/>I consider it an open invitation to say negative things about games, which may not be appealing                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/markv" title="markv"><img alt="markv" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/markv">markv</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84449/#Comment_84449" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-31T19:28:44+00:00" title="July 31, 2007  7:28PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham W</cite>Mark, are there any of those games that you wish you hadn't bought?</blockquote>\nnope, although there are games on the list that I haven't bought that i should probably buy<br/><br/>since I value diversity in games I'm fine with the fact that I won't like everything about everything                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84458/#Comment_84458" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-31T20:13:19+00:00" title="July 31, 2007  8:13PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 31, 2007 8:14PM by Ben_Lehman.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heartbreaker does not mean "bad game."<br/><br/>Please stop misusing it.<br/><br/>Carry on talking about games you don't like...

As I contemplate how to dispose of TWENTY BOXES of RPG materials (to make room in my home and life for my fiance), I'm starting to question that. Of course most of those materials are endless supplements to mainstream games. But really, it just means I have to be a bit pickier. At least half of the indie games I've bought have been because of very specific reccomendations. Ok, so I was pushed towards Riddle of Steel at the Forge booth one year at Gencon instead of getting a demo of Universalis that I wanted to have - Riddle of Steel is one of the few "indie" games in those boxes. I did buy Universalis, and it's still on my shelf. Because when I read it, I really got something from the book, and it's just one thin little book, jam packed with good stuff. And sometime I'll play it, but in the meantime, it helped me understand gaming better. I purchased Dogs in the Vinyard on reccomendation as an idea mine, in PDF form out of respect for my sagging shelves. Then I played the game, and now I have a print copy and now it sits proudly on my shelf as a game to play AND a reference on how to cut to the chase in rules design.<br/><br/>These days I'll admit that I'm not finding "indie" or "story" games of much appeal. But they've sure shown me what to look for in a game. My D&amp;D play (D20, or my current direction towards Original D&amp;D plus Greyhawk etc. supplements) is better for having experimented with indie games. And I'm sure I'll return to indie games at some point.<br/><br/>The discussion of how the religion is defined (or not) in Dogs in the Vinyard got me thinking about religion in gaming. A bunch of years back, I was running RuneQuest, and getting frustrated at the expression of religion in that game. I then researched real religions, and tried to incorporate them into my next game. And then I abandoned the idea and started playing D&amp;D. Then I played Dogs. This morning I realized why those earlier attempts failed, and why Dogs is so awesome. See, in Dogs, the religion IS NOT defined. Sure, it's hinted at. But really the game is about the PLAYERS interpretation, and more importantly, application, of religion. And it only works because the religion isn't defined. If the religion was defined such that the game evaluated each act and produced a "piety" score or some such, the game really wouldn't be fun. Oh, I guess it could be, but it wouldn't be about the religion really. It would be about how the game drives that score. But Dogs succeeds at being about the religion, or at least the players interpretation and application of it because, and only because, the game doesn't seek to judge the player's interpretation and application. So now I sit back and realize that the cults in RQ are great for what they are. They do drive something, but it isn't religious introspection. And D&amp;D, well, it really doesn't need that much definition of religion, in fact, what I have observed is that when alignment is used as a "score," the game doesn't work. D&amp;D alignment is just a way to identify which team you play for, and it CAN be fun to have PCs from different teams, though mostly I've seen that fail, but perhaps that's because alignment is seen as a score or something to judge, and not just an identifier of which team you're on.<br/><br/>On Fudge dice: I can see why the cancellation seems bad. But there's a lot of neatness, and it can work. One of my favorite systems, Cold Iron, uses a zero centered randomizer. It uses a normal distribution (I won't try and explain it here, <a href="http://welcometofranksworld.blogspot.com/2005/12/cold-iron-task-resolution.html" rel="nofollow">see this post on my blog</a>). Fudge dice work in a similar way, though not open ended. There is a really cool factor about Fudge dice. The math is easy. You pull out blank dice, and matched sets of + and -. And then count the remaining dice and add or subtract the count to your ability. Very simple. And most of the time you're adding or subtracting 0, 1, or 2. Of course Fudge goes and (in my mind) complicates this by giving it's own names for the numbers instead of one, two, three, ... (or even more visually simple for most of us, 1, 2, 3, ...).<br/><br/>On weird dice: I like them. I also like the cleanliness of using only d6. But then I miss all my neat polyhedral dice. I'm not sure about games that require stacks of d10s and only d10s...<br/><br/>Oh, and I've come to love anti-golden rule statements. It would be nice if games didn't have to have them, but here we are, so many gamers have been brought up on golden rule games. And that isn't to say that every game must be played by the rules, but I think it does the author a disservice if you don't at least try the game by the rules. And if you can;t play by the rules (or at least most of them, and then at least 90% if not 99% of the core), then perhaps you should be playing a different game. That isn't to say that occaisional experiments aren't good or fun. We never needed golden rules (or rule 0s) back in the days to experiment with Monopoly, or Chess. Heck, within a year or two of playing Tractics II (my first venture into the extended wargaming/RPG hobby), I was experimenting with changing the rules, or at least making my own map board. But one reason I loved Cold Iron was that the core of the game worked for me (sure, I changed stuff, and probably actually changed quite a bit, but at least much of the core was the same, and to my defense, some of my changes were because there was no complete game text published, others were experiments).<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84820/#Comment_84820" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-01T15:29:54+00:00" title="August  1, 2007  3:29PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite><cite>Posted By: Russell Collins</cite>D20 Dictionary of Mu?</blockquote>\nI have the Manjunk Feat.<br/><br/>I'd actually love to see a "words only" conversion.
