But, I recently re-read the AFMBE sourcebook, <b>Fistful o' Zombies</b>, and it has a mini-setting in the back called <i>North, to Alaska</i> - all about the Yukon gold rush interrupted by a meteor strike that raises the restless dead. I think this might be a good set-up for a game using Dust Devils - a limited group of miners, including the PCs, find themselves having to adapt to survive, and face their demons along the way in a claustrophobic setting punctuated by picaresque scenery and occasional tragedy - but I've not run, or played, the game before. <br/><br/>Has anyone more experience with this game they can help me with. For the record, this is likely to be my last best hope of being able to run DD with my group, as 'straight' Western is unlikely to cut it with them (no cowboys, please, we're British). Any tips for keeping it moving / making it sing / encouraging the juicy PvP conflicts I picture at the heart of the game?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397616/#Comment_397616" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-15T13:21:59+00:00" title="November 15, 2012  1:21PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/downloads/index.php?file=/free_games/frost_devils.pdf" rel="nofollow">Frost Devils</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Millsy" title="Millsy"><img alt="Millsy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Millsy">Millsy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397617/#Comment_397617" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-15T13:23:43+00:00" title="November 15, 2012  1:23PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Jason!

I've written about playing it in depth at the Forge, so for now I'll just give my main pointer I always give out on it:<br/><br/>The DD conflict is lethal, so the way to pace its use is for everybody at the table to take the bluffing seriously. If your hand doesn't seem too good, you absolutely have to fold, unless you specifically want a quick and dirty end. Folding costs a coin and ends the conflict with stakes unresolved. This rule is just about the most awesome thing in the game, and something that we see only too rarely in conflict resolution rpgs: in Dust Devils the way a story goes is that characters skirt about the definitive conclusion, back off and come back later on, until at some point both sides of the conflict are confident enough about their hands to put the cards down and finish it in a way that very well might prove lethal to either or both parties.<br/><br/>What the above means is that the first time you play the game it's going to be a one-shot, effectively, unless you shirk the rules somehow. This is a feature: the players just have to shoot each other's brains out once before you can even speculate about playing a slightly longer and slower game. Once the players learn to fear and respect the cards, that's when you might have a shot at slower build-ups and such. The way the game plays is so different from a game where you roll the dice every 10 minutes that it's almost inevitable that the players will be too trigger-happy to begin with. It's still fun, of course - DD is the game that defines Blood Opera for me and many others.<br/><br/>The above also means that it's very useful to recognize that some conflicts are only relevant in the short term, while others are unsolvable contradictions between men of honor; no matter how many times these two meet each other, they're always going to go for their guns. The first type of conflict has to be resolved here and now if you crave resolution, even if your hand is bad; you won't get a second chance if you back down. The second type of conflict is what the game revolves around: contradictory value systems or permanent stakes float around the landscape, and the involved characters end up in new conflicts over their differences reliably until one or the other actually pulls the trigger.<br/><br/>A secondary tip related to the first one: recognize that Dust Devils does not have a non-violent conflict resolution system. The only way to resolve conflicts non-violently is to threaten violence and then have the other side back down. Even if you describe the conflict in a non-violent way, the outcome will still more often than not be brutal in consequences. It is very interesting to try to mitigate this: for example, the players might agree that in this conflict we're neither of us going to play a hand better than a pair, just so we can resolve things amiably and in a gentlemanly manner, without disfiguring each other horribly. Whether either party actually holds onto their promise is another matter, of course. Everybody should be ready to describe how even a superficially nonviolent conflict turns into something that destroys people: when your character loses half his attribute points in that single tongue-lashing from his girlfriend, it's definitely appropriate to describe how he falls into drinking and gets into a brawl that almost kills him. It's weak-ass to try to skirt the violent consequences of conflict by pretending that lost attribute points are not concrete damage that characters suffer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Millsy" title="Millsy"><img alt="Millsy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Millsy">Millsy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397622/#Comment_397622" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-15T13:40:11+00:00" title="November 15, 2012  1:40PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's awesome, too, Eero - thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397648/#Comment_397648" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-15T15:34:56+00:00" title="November 15, 2012  3:34PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I fully agree with Eero's analysis, especially the "nonviolent description -&gt; brutal consequences" advice. That was my group's biggest trip-up.<br/><br/>The other issue is that not all characters will reach that conclusive battle at the same time. Let that come naturally rather than try to make everyone's conflict reach its height at the same time. If that means someone checks out of the game early, that's okay, they can make a new character, play an NPC, or come up with a new/changed Devil (see the rules in the book for how to do this).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
