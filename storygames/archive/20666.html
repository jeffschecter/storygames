It's a pulpy sword and planet setting featuring an impossibly large planet that has at least a million moons. Manza is home to hundreds of diverse cultures which have recently discovered a use for the Inferno Opal gems- fueling jets strapped onto their wooden sailing ships so they can fly to the various moons and See What's There.<br/><br/>The game is going to be one-part exploration of the exotic and one-part Burroughs- and Spielberg-inspired action. You and your friends (or just play solo, that's supported), visit a new moon each session and find something interesting. You can use the relics, creatures and people above to help conquer the kingdoms below, create your own lunar empires or just get data for your PC's thesis.<br/><br/>The game is here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13HHe-Qzc-jKt1kuBiPo-xEUS6H2U2enApXrtV4dAvOo/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">https://docs.google.com/document/d/13HHe-Qzc-jKt1kuBiPo-xEUS6H2U2enApXrtV4dAvOo/edit?usp=sharing</a>. You can add comments if you like.<br/><br/>Where the draft stands now is that I'm finishing up the generator systems. One set of tables creates the moon, another creates enemies, another allows you to make loot on-the-fly and another section is for creating dungeons and quests. The skeleton is there for each; I'm just filling in the flavors. Next on my list is adding a friendly/neutral NPC encounter generator.<br/><br/>What you do is roll up a planet, grab a blank planet sheet, fill in the info, then use that to reference the various creatures, hazards and wonders you find. It's kind of like a Make Your Own Choose Your Own Adventure system.<br/><br/>Gameplay itself is going to be based on Black Hack, which is incredibly versatile yet with minimal rules. I'll save that part for last since it will probably only take an afternoon to port over.<br/><br/>I'd really love to hear what you have to say.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453790/#Comment_453790" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-10T17:22:37+00:00" title="June 10, 2016  5:22PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 10, 2016 5:24PM by David_Berg.">edited June 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like the idea of dungeons/missions/destinations as moons.  Really frees you up for variety and alienness!\n<blockquote>You can use the relics, creatures and people above to help conquer the kingdoms below, create your own lunar empires or just get data for your PC's thesis.</blockquote>Is any of this specifically supported?  The first two sound super fun to me, but I might be underwhelmed if it was totally on me or the GM or whoever to make that happen.  I guess, more broadly, I'm wondering if there's any particular large-scale reward structure in place.  "Get cool stuff to use on more ambitious ventures" sounds cool to me, I'd just want to know that (a) there will indeed be cool stuff and (b) there will be ambitious venture options and (c) that the former will in fact be useful for the latter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DiscoSoup" title="DiscoSoup"><img alt="DiscoSoup" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DiscoSoup">DiscoSoup</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453867/#Comment_453867" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-15T15:43:10+00:00" title="June 15, 2016  3:43PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry, I forgot that I posted here. Yeah, it's going to be supported in the setting. It's part of the later portion of the development cycle. So I'm going to be editing the rewards of the quest given to Abandoned moons (it's already edited in the Klyron supplement that I put out on Drivethru), to be a bit more powerful (your choice of two weapons/armor). The Fortress gives you a base and small fleet if you beat it, the Pirate nest will do something similar. The Wild planet is going to give you the option to call down a Titan from the moon to destroy enemy armies and so on. Thanks, <a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a>. I really appreciate the comments.<br/><br/>The main game is going to support a war for the surface, and I hope to also put in a system where you roll random trouble for the moons that you rule, and maybe conflicts with other moon empires.<br/><br/>A big, big influence on this was the old Tales of the Jedi comics from Dark Horse. There's a planet there, called Dxun, that has a moon that gets so close that you can ride a dragon from the moon to the planet with no problems. Cheesy and unrealistic? Yes. Fun? Double yes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
