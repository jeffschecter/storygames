Why should each different elven culture require a different elven race? Why do "wood elves" and "high elves" have to be different races? Why can't they just be elves who live differently? That sort of thing.</blockquote>\nOh, wow, this reminds me of a game that I sketched up in my teens but never actually played. It was supposed to start in an early Bronze Age, prehistory kind of thing, with a handful of different cultures per race, with different ability biases and environments. And, periodically, play would shift forward a generation or two, and changes to the world and cultures would occur based on the cultures' statistics and the things that the PCs accomplished in the preceding interim.<br/><br/>(WTF, why didn't I<i>play</i>that?)<br/><br/>Anyway, I can remember a few of them. The humans all started off as totemic cultures; I remember a Crow Clan, a Lion Clan, and a Bear Clan, but there were probably others. Their abilities were based on their totems; e.g. the Crows were scavengers, had a written language already, and were more likely to develop tools first; the Lions were hunters, and better suited to warfare; the Bears were gatherers and fishermen, and were the hardiest of the humans. All of this was<i>starting out</i>, mind you; this stuff was subject to change from generation to generation. Cultures could splinter, and so on.<br/><br/>Let's see, I can remember the Dire Rock dwarves, who were stocky, hairy, and started with bronze technology. The Haunt Rock dwarves were taller, and thin, with longer beards but less hair in general, and they had a good chance to develop magic, and also cloth.<br/><br/>The elves started off unified, but would, in one of the first few generations of play, receive dispensations from three conflicting deities, which would almost certainly prompt a three-part schism (or four-part, if a group declined to worship<i>any</i>of the three gods). And then a war, which any combination of the elven cultures might survive or be annihilated.<br/><br/>I can't remember the ogres, but I know they were there. Trolls were there too, but for some reason didn't evolve to trolldom until a few generations into play. There were several clans of goblins (I've never really felt comfortable about using the term "orc" outside of Middle Earth, so my goblins are actually a combination of Tolkien's orcs and your contemporary fantasy goblins -- it just depends on whether a given goblin is born big and scary or scrawny and sharp), of which I can only remember the Dead Crow clan, who started with witchcraft and were the most likely to contact demons first.<br/><br/>Man, I gotta see if I can find the old notes for this fucker.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite><br/><br/>Yes, yes you should.</blockquote>\nWell, I couldn't find my notes. They're either gone, or they're not with all my other old game notes. I can distinctly remember writing up a huge tech tree when I was supposed to be taking notes in class. It was probably stupid, given my age at the time, but I remember doing it, and I remember it going from flint to lasers.<br/><br/>Also, I think I <i>may have</i> played this once, for a brief amount of time. I can remember one of my cousin James' characters killing one of my characters with a flint knife, and I can only surmise that it was this game.<br/><br/>But, since I can't find the notes, I suggest brainstorming.<br/><br/>First off: cultures need stats for:<br/><br/>- Discovering new things. Both resources and features of the environment, and scientific &amp; magical principles once appropriate tech has been attained<br/>- Inventing new things. Inventions would of course rest on the discoveries you've made so far.<br/>- Engineering. I.e. a stat that determines the <i>quality</i> of your tech, and your ability to improve on it.<br/>- Warfare. Mass battles would be abstracted.<br/>- Trade<br/>- Diplomacy<br/><br/>Anything else?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228402/#Comment_228402" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-28T10:49:31+00:00" title="August 28, 2009 10:49AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 28, 2009 10:50AM by Levi Kornelsen.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Huhm.<br/><br/>Okay, can we have some idea of the scale you're considering, in terms of the size of a cultural group over the time period?

Um...<br/><br/>Ok, so, the idea is you've got this starting map of cultures, with one or more implicit conflicts (inter-culture, intra-culture, and/or culture vs. nature). So, you pick one to "play into," stat up some PCs that represent exceptional members of the culture, and take some action to deal with the conflict. K?<br/><br/>Between this "playing in," you have things going on at the bigger scale. Most of the warfare, invention, discovery, etc. is going to happen in this stage. But it's going to happen influenced by what the PCs accomplished just now. Does that make sense?<br/><br/>When we're up at the big scale, and nobody wants to take a conflict to "playing in," the stuff just gets resolved by dice based on the cultures' stats and resources. We continue this process until we reach a situation that we're interested in "playing in." Considerable time may have passed, generations even.<br/><br/>Am I making more sense yet?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228408/#Comment_228408" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-28T10:58:21+00:00" title="August 28, 2009 10:58AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, you've been making sense all along; I'm just trying to...

I'm gonna crib from a bunch of books I've been reading recently, now, and throw some whacky ideas at you.  Keep what you like, ignore the rest.<br/><br/>First, a stat that indicates cultural "centrality" - that is, do the members of the culture live as isolated wanderers, or do they pack together in tight cities?  The more centrality a culture has, the faster it can develop culture and technology - lone geniuses are well and good, but it's rapid exchange and refinement that makes things into cultural standards, no matter how far Merkin the Mad Mage has pushed out.  A centralised culture also makes it easier for the culture to have specialists - from politicians to priests to glassblowers.  Centrality is first seriously acquired (real world) by sedentary lifestyles, usually things like growing crops.  In a fantasy world...  Who knows?  <br/><br/>Second, Centrality is a shit name for a stat.<br/><br/>Third, a stat for "industrial power".  By which I mean, how much oomph can Joe the guy on the street harness at need?  Just the output of his muscles?  A team of oxen?  A steam engine?  Bulldozers?  Industrial power determines how fast the society can change footing - think about how countries moved to a "war footing" in WWII, and how fast they moved back out again afterwards (well, most of them, anyhow) - rapid transitions like that require power.<br/><br/>Fourth, population as a stat.  Which should have been first on my list.<br/><br/>Fifth, Ideology.  Ideology protects against cultural absorbtion.  A culture with a low ideology score would be adaptable, flexible, fast on it's feet, and easily eaten up by another culture.  A culture with a high score would be hidebound, inflexible, and very defensible.  A nice way of getting the benefits of both could have a running internal conflict between low-ideology and high-ideology populations (Liberal vs. Conservative, nyah!), but it might not be stable (c'mon, show me your bias).<br/><br/>Sixth, sanitation and medicine, bay-beeee.<br/><br/>Not sure if that's anything like what you wanted, but hey.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228424/#Comment_228424" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-28T11:27:46+00:00" title="August 28, 2009 11:27AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, yes, very cool!

Do both!<br/><br/>Mechanic:  Sanitation affects your population growth, in some dead-simple way that can thereafter be ignored, to represent all that jazz.  It also provides some defense against event-plague.<br/><br/>Events: Yes.<br/><br/>...............<br/><br/>Note: Also - big scary illnesses often develop in places where people have regular traffic with animals.  The more regular, the 'better'.  The people in the places of regular contact <i>can</i> develop resistance (but not always).  <br/><br/>So, when we meet the people that have domesticated the hoobadoobeast, that might well mean "plague".  When our cities become host to rats, that might mean plague.  Basically, when you push back the boundaries of the world and meet new people, plague is often waiting for someone.  It might be you.

It's kind of ethnocentrism, assuming that our cultural traits are universal cultural traits.  I don't think it's a huge problem, I just think it's ignoring potential.  It's like when playing Civilisation.  By the end of the game, the civilisations all look exactly the same.  It's not bad, it's just boring.  So here's how I'd do it:<br/><br/>Cultures have "traits" that represent how they differ from surrounding cultures.  If you start stone age, all the cultures have stone tools, unless a culture has the "Bronzeworking" trait.  Conversely, if a culture has the "Nomadic" trait, you can assume all the other cultures are not nomadic.  One culture might have the "numerous" trait, or another could have the "Witch Doctors" trait.  It's up to you what gets called out as traits, and what's standard.<br/><br/>Then there's a list of things a culture can do every generation.  Something like:<br/>1) Acquire a trait from another culture<br/>2) Remove a trait from another culture<br/>3) Develop a new trait<br/>4) Lose an existing trait<br/><br/>Maybe every generation there are troubles and such as well.  Wars, famines, disasters, discoveries, diseases, and so on.  They can use their traits to roll against those troubles.  The fallout from troubles is new traits, losing old traits, changing existing traits, as well as merging with another culture or splitting off into two cultures.  <br/><br/>When cultures merge, there's a roll to see which of the traits from the two cultures go forward into the new culture.  Maybe all of them do, maybe some are lost.<br/><br/>When cultures split, do the same thing.  There should always be a difference of at least one trait though.<br/><br/>When a trait is lost, you can either say that the trait is gone, or that it has become ubiquitous.  It's up to you.<br/><br/>Every few generations you can change the general level of technology, if you like, and change traits appropriately.<br/><br/>So what you get is these cultures organically shifting and splitting and merging, with the traits acting like memes within the field of all the existing cultures.  Traits shift around and multiply, or die out.  Cultures grow up and aquire traits, and change over time.  Nomadic barbarians with superior technology become primitive agrarians.

Colorless functions. F'rinstance, don't think of "Engineering" strictly in a mechanical sense; if your culture has a tech like "Contacting and placating the spirits of nature," its Engineering stat is going to determine the quality and rate of improvement of quality of said communication.<br/><br/>Things like tech and cultural values, those are non-numerical traits that can be applied to roll for a bonus (letting you roll more dice and take the best). So, things like "Nomadic" and "Bronzeworking" are already traits, the way I'm thinking of this. They can be developed independently, and they can be communicated between cultures in contact with each other.<br/><br/>And, of course, it's best if the player controlling a given culture works to have them acquire traits that help them deal with their environment. Otherwise, they'll probably die off.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_231042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231042/#Comment_231042" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-10T05:11:47+00:00" title="September 10, 2009  5:11AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I will make this game.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a week.<br/>\n<br/>\nBets on how much/little will it rock and/or if/how late I will be to meet the deadline welcome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232086/#Comment_232086" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-13T06:54:07+00:00" title="September 13, 2009  6:54AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 13, 2009 7:00AM by Wordman.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You might get some mileage out of paying attention to what the computer versions of <i>Civilization</i> struggled with over their various editions and figuring out what you want to do in those areas (or, figuring out how the tools of RPGs could make them work better). The two areas that jump out at me as being radically altered for each edition (to varying degrees of success) are:<br/>\n<br/>\nReligion<br/>\nSlavery<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might also want to compare the differences between the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.civfanatics.com/civ4/techtree/" rel="nofollow">full tech tree</a> of <i>Civilization IV</i> with the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://wiihd.wikidot.com/news:073108-civ-rev-tech-tree" rel="nofollow">slimmed down one</a> from <i>Civilization Revolution</i>. The choices made during the optimization are interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the notion that each civilization has a certain set of "alignments", for lack of a better word, is sort of interesting. For example, in Civ IV, the Greeks are \u201cPhilosophical\u201d and \u201cAggressive\u201d, and this provides bonuses that tend to steer the civilization in that direction. Choosing these correctly could be a way to counter the concern voiced above of cultural bias. On the other hand, it could reinforce it as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meej" title="Meej"><img alt="Meej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meej">Meej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232250/#Comment_232250" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-14T10:27:30+00:00" title="September 14, 2009 10:27AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Roby</cite>So is the idea to play on the single-individual scale for a session or three, then zoom out and do "civilization stuff" to create the next situation that is played at the single-individual scale for another session or three?</blockquote>\nGiven that that's the idea, I see similarities in that to the late-90s Aria RPG/World Guide from Last Unicorn Games.
