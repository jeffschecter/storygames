Like Jedi, they are in tune with The Force.<br/><br/>Force Talents:<br/>- Balance: Use this to stay focused and centered when Riding a Wave, getting beat up, or tripping on drugs.<br/>- Cool: You present yourself well. This is good for impressing people, looking good, and pulling chicks.<br/>- Perception: Eagle-eyes, ears like a bat. You know the score, you can sniff out a weakness. Use this to catch a thief, catch a wave, or catch your girlfriend cheating.<br/><br/><br/>Instinct.<br/>Are you a clumsy fool, or have you honed your instincts to razor-sharpness? You need raw talent to become a legend of the beach.<br/><br/>Instinct Talents:<br/>- Agility: Use this to stay above water and demonstrate your skill when performing any feat of physical co-ordination and skill, especially when Riding a Wave.<br/>- Know-How: Use this when demonstrating your copious knowledge or mastery of technical skills, like fixing the car so you can get to the beach!<br/>- Tenacity: You can take a lickin' with the best of 'em, 'cause you always know when you just can't quit. Use this to push your way to success, struggle through hardship or paddle out to a wave.<br/><br/><br/>Access.<br/>Social contacts, resources, and how to end a scene.<br/><br/>Access Talents:<br/>- Exit: Use this when you want to leave a scene collection with style. Knowing when to make your exit requires social prowess, and you can't just run away because somebody's beatin' on ya.<br/>- Friends: You can call up your friends to give you a bonus, just like equipment. Or make new friends!<br/>- Gear: Use this to buy or acquire equipment.<br/><br/><br/>Mentor:<br/>Roll 2d10 to see who taught you how to surf, what Standard Technique you know, and what Technique Tree you can learn from:<br/><br/>02-03 A ninja (Training, The Mysterious East).<br/>04-05 A surf champ from back-in-the-day (Achievement, Old School)<br/>06-07 Self-taught (Endurance, New School).<br/>08-09 Anybody who was willing to teach you (Endurance, Old School).<br/>10-14 Your older brother (Training, New School).<br/>15-16 Mr. Miyagi, the Karate Kid, or Jackie Chan (Meditation, The Mysterious East).<br/>17-18 The CIA (Achievement, School of the Americas).<br/>19-20 You don't know how to surf?!? (no Techniques).<br/><br/><br/>Anyone can learn the standard techniques. Technique Trees are as follows, and all Techniques require a Commendation Point unless otherwise noted:<br/><br/>Old School:<br/>- Friends All Over: The surfer can always find somebody who knows and respects him or his Mentor (treat as a +1 Force friend).<br/>- Unshakeable: The surfer may ignore 1 point of Instinct attribute loss.<br/>- Zen: The surfer may ignore 1 point of Force attribute loss.<br/>(one more...)<br/><br/>New School:<br/>- Armed and Dangerous: The surfer has a +0 firearm in his possession (each Commendation Point adds a +1 Instinct bonus).<br/>- Unshakeable: The surfer may ignore 1 point of Instinct attribute loss.<br/>- Wheels: The surfer has access to a car (treat as a +1 Instinct piece of equipment).<br/><br/>The Mysterious East:<br/>- Connected: The surfer can import people and equipment using his Mentor as a reference. This does not require the surfer to spend Commendation points.<br/>- Inspirational: The surfer can restore one lost attribute die (himself or others).<br/>- Zen: The surfer may ignore 1 point of Force attribute loss.<br/>(one more...)<br/><br/>School of the Americas:<br/>- Case Officer: The surfer is provided with moral support from his agency (treat as +1 Force friend).<br/>- Connected: The surfer can import people and equipment using his Mentor as a reference. This does not require the surfer to spend Commendation points.<br/>- Phony: The surfer can disguise or hide herself from others.<br/>- Undercover: The Agent has a cover identity on the beach. This does not require the surfer to spend Commendation points.<br/><br/><br/>Age.<br/>Roll 2d6 for your character's age, or pick your own age (you need to be 16 to enter a surf competition):<br/><br/>02-03   14 + 2d6<br/>04-06   16 + 2d6<br/>07-08   16 + 2d10<br/>09-10   20 + 2d10<br/>11-12   24 + 2d10<br/><br/>I'll let you figure out the Heart Rate stats for characters under the age of 21.<br/><br/><br/>Gender.<br/>You can play, like, the chicks from Blue Crush, instead of just trying to mac on them, if you don't want to play a dude. No pressure, man. We don't like to judge people.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_159688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/159688/#Comment_159688" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-29T22:19:21+00:00" title="July 29, 2008 10:19PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Play.<br/><br/>Instead of going on missions, surfers play out the important days of their lives, called scene collections. Each scene collection begins with a shore scene. This can include surfing practice, but no competition. It can also take place away from the shore (like, on a boat, or in an airplane) but only if it leads to a Nightlife climax. Surf Competition climaxes must always start with a shore scene during the day.<br/><br/>The first surfer to enter his Target Heart Rate can shift the scene from a shore scene into either a Surf Competition climax or a Nightlife climax, depending on the restrictions stated above. If Static reaches 5 points before a surfer declares the scene, the Surf Master may choose either climax, regardless of restrictions.<br/><br/>Nightlife.<br/>If he declares a Nightlife scene, he gets to pick what the goal of the evening is. Any character that succeeds in achieving this goal gets to learn a new Technique.<br/><br/>Surf Competition.<br/>If he declares a Surf Competition scene, only surfers who compete in the competition will gain Commendation Points from rolling 6s while in their Target Heart Rate. You also gain an extra Commendation Point every time you Ride The Wave. This is usually a three-step process. First, you wait for your set. Roll Force (Perception) to find the right wave. If you succeed, you can ride that wave three times. If you fail, or do not roll, any wave you catch can only be ridden once. To actually catch a wave, you roll Instinct (Tenacity). Now you're set up. Tubular. Roll Force (Balance) or Instinct (Agility) to Ride the Wave. Success nets you an extra Commendation Point.<br/><br/>Once a Surf Competition climax has been declared, surfers may not introduce new friends or equipment. Access (Exit) is used to bow out of the competition. There can only be a maximum of one winner in any Surf Competition. That surfer may learn a new Technique, from any school. If Static reaches 20 before there is only one of the player's surfers left, all of them lose and some NPC surfer wins the competition.<br/><br/>Friends and Equipment.<br/>Anything that will give you a bonus lasts until the end of the next scene collection. So, you get to start a scene collection with whatever you Accessed last scene collection. They don't have to actually show up until you use them for the bonus, either.<br/><br/>Injuries.<br/>Injuries that impair Force and Instinct attributes also carry over to the next scene collection. Further impairment carries over one scene collection, but impairment suffered earlier than last scene collection is recovered. Dropping to Force 0 destroys a surfer's drive to become a legend. He settles down and gets a real job. Dropping to Instinct 0 leaves a surfer physically unable to ever surf professionally again. No more Surf Competitions.<br/><br/>The Surfer's Code of Conduct.<br/>If a surfer commits and act of un-surfsmanlike conduct, the Surf Master can use the Impaired Access rule against him. Access is restored next scene collection, unless it is reduced to 0, which results in a permanent ban from the surfer community and all competitions.<br/><br/>A Legend of the Beach.<br/>When a surfer gets promoted, he becomes a legend on his own beach. He gains the Seniority technique. He can only spend Commendation Points during Surf Competitions, though. When he has spent enough of these to be promoted again, he joins the ranks of world-wide surf legends and fulfills his destiny. He becomes a Legend of the Beach.<br/><br/><br/>Vaya con Dios.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
