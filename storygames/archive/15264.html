Some 30+ years ago, we had it all: narration rights, conch shell mechanics. I GM'ed old-school Shadowrun yesterday, using the prof's rules -- and it was a very, very, very good session. Just as my players and I like it, the mechanics took a backseat, but subtly determined who got to narrate. Great stuff.

He told me that Mr. Barker used these rules with the Tekumel groups he trusted. He had tried the "official", very D&amp;D-like "Empire of the Petal Throne" rules, but didn't like them too much. So he used a system of d100 rolls, with low=positive effect, and high=negative effect. Then, after he had gained some insight into the players and their characters, he'd switch to Perfected. Those rules were never published, but are pure M.A.R. Barker and thus, pure Tekumel.<br/><br/>komradeob:<br/>I hear what you're saying. Suffice it to say, your mileage may vary. I found nearly all "Forge" games hard to digest and way too metagamey. Personally, neither my group nor I (we've been playing since 1984) need any other tool that defines what goes how into play. This is one thing that's so refreshing about those old-school story-gamers: They make sure you understand that there's no right or wrong way to play Tekumel, or any other world. If you need more rules, cool, just add them.<br/><br/>Per:<br/>You ask about dice. It doesn't matter! Why should it matter when all we're doing is trying to roll higher than the other player? If you want to add, subtract, divide, multiply, take the square root, whatever: Go ahead and do it! All you need to know is: Who is higher? Same goes for "close". We're rolling d20s, and we define close as "within 2 or 3 points". Other groups define it differently. Not a problem, either.<br/><br/>I have GMed and played Sorcerer, PTA, the Pool, octaNe and many other "indie-games". Too complicated, too many rules, too much "mechanism". I don't need any of it. <br/>But again, your mileage may vary. We get that reaction a lot: "But where is the game?", or "That's hand-waving". Personally, I think these questions and the thinking behind it are the remnants of old-time D&amp;D play where you had to roll certain numbers or better to succeed. If you trust your co-players and the process, you'll either find you don't need more rules than "Perfected", or you'll add stuff that's specifically yours.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_346744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346744/#Comment_346744" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-24T05:31:44+00:00" title="October 24, 2011  5:31AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, I think they're saying that it's too hand-wavy because that isn't really a game, as much as it is a toy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_346745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346745/#Comment_346745" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-24T05:45:39+00:00" title="October 24, 2011  5:45AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's what I meant, Norbert, that the group has to define it individually.

We don't need more.<br/><br/>Rules? Tools? Behavioral Guidelines?<br/><br/>I dunno, call 'em what you will.<br/><br/>I do think you're still missing the core point I am trying to make, though.<br/><br/>You're coming to this from the angle of someone already versed in RPGs and are failing to see all of your own skills and experience because you're really jazzed up at the idea that mechanically, you can get away with just this one simple, commonsense mechanic.<br/><br/><b>FWIW, I also went through that period of being really jazzed up upon the discovery that I too could get away with just that simple of a mechanic.</b><br/><br/>I was equally pleased to find out that there were indeed other people out there working with similarly simple mechanical core concepts. Not just Barker, but guys like Howard Whitehouse and our own member MatrixGamer and Paddy Griffith. Not just working with, but playing games very successfully and writing about it.<br/><br/>The thing is though, you are forgetting about all of the other stuff that goes into your gaming that makes it work.<br/><br/>Really, really basic stuff that you've internalized. Procedures and methods that you wouldn't even think of as<b> rules</b>, nor conceive of why anyone would need some of them written down.<br/><br/>Well, transferal of ideas for one.<br/><br/>Even assuming that each and every group of players will indeed eventually find their own answers, it is still a good idea to start with some kind of baseline they can work from.<br/><br/>Also, and I've seen this come up with a number of designs, including published, for sale ones by people whose work I admire, authors/designers often overlook somereally essential elements of their own play. Sometimes what they leave out is actually what makes their play work, is perhaps actually essential to it. <br/><br/>(Obviously, that bit is no sin exclusive to things like Doc Barker's game or similarly uber ultra lite mechanics.Plenty of games suffer from this regardless of mechanical complexity).<br/><br/>This mechanic is a starting point, not an end point.<br/><br/>I hope you won't take my feedback negatively. I too think there's a whole bunch of neat stuff that can be done gaming wise with a simple, commonsense core mechanic like this and would love to see more conversation about that subject around these parts.<br/><br/>As just a quick example of what I'm talking about, consider that the interesting stuff surrounding Prof Barker's use of that mechanic is all of the myriad wys gamng could be approached tied into Tekumel. Even using just tha core mechanic there are an almost uncountable number of variations to gaming in that setting, all of which could and probably should get write ups, none of which ever touch or even vary that mechanic greatly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_346786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346786/#Comment_346786" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-24T11:05:31+00:00" title="October 24, 2011 11:05AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 24, 2011 11:06AM by komradebob.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oops.

This is just life, and it's not always fun and giggles.\n<blockquote><br/>I think the purpose of adding more structure (i.e. more rules) to the game is to allow the game to more consistently generate fun play, and also to allow less skilled players to enjoy themselves<br/></blockquote>\nThis is not my experience. As I wrote above, we tried a lot of forge games, and none (except The Pool, octaNe and some of the Harlekin-Maus stuff) really worked for us. They were thoroughly unfun *because* they controled aspects of the game we didn't want to be controled, if that makes sense.\n<blockquote><br/>In this sense Perfected is to story games as Fudge is to traditional RPGs. Fudge is very fun to play if you're well-versed in RPGs and<em>know</em>how to create a fun collaborative game. However, Fudge<em>could</em>be a disaster in the hands of a newbie gaming group. I think the same would go for Perfected.<br/></blockquote>\nJonathan, the experience I make again and again is this: The less roleplaying experience a player has, the smoother he plays with freeform or loose rules.<br/><br/><br/><b>Komradebob:</b><br/>My "phase" was the three-year stint in Forge territory. Those games simply didn't do it for us. We've been playing freeform and/or diceless since 1991, so I guess I can say this is where our expertise is.<br/><br/>Personally, my experience is that NO amount of carefully crafted rules can guarantee a fun game. For instance: Some people love PTA; after many sessions, we can say it doesn't cut it for us. Some people like rules, be they "trad" or "forge". Others don't. We always see the world through our filters, and you, komrade, seem to go for rules because you think all the group contract stuff should be formalized. That's cool, it works for you. For us, it doesn't.<br/><br/>We have guest players on a regular basis. Many of them like our freeform style, and they play whenever time allows. Others hate the fact that there's no explicit rule for, say, who says what how to whom. That's okay, too. They tried it, didn't like it, and move on.<br/><br/><b>Fact is, many people don't need rules structures for things that are covered by the group contract.</b><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: SentientGames</cite><br/>I get the distinct feeling that some people don't like the idea that narrative-style gaming (as simple as it might have been at that time) existed before The Forge and Story Games. <br/></blockquote>\nI agree.<br/><br/><br/><b>Valamir:</b><br/>I think there's a misunderstanding here.<br/>You write there's no sense of accomplishment with rules like Perfected. <br/>But this depends on the granularity of your narration.<br/><br/>Let me explain:<br/>If I roll once for each fight, and the higher result gets to narrate the outcome, then there is no sense of accomplishment, I agree.<br/>But if you roll for each action, for each swing with the sword, so to speak, then suddenly, there is suspense.<br/>And again, different groups handle this differently.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_346870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Georgios" title="Georgios"><img alt="Georgios" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Georgios">Georgios</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346870/#Comment_346870" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-25T03:54:41+00:00" title="October 25, 2011  3:54AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 25, 2011 3:55AM by Georgios.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a little unsure about the purpose of this thread. I appreciate you pointing out that people have used rules to determine narration rights 30+ years ago. But I don't think it's as much of a bombshell or revelation to people as you might think. I mean I wasn't aware of a specific rules set doing those things (so thanks for the facts), but I assumed that people had discovered tinkering and simplifying rules before I started gaming. <br/><br/>But then your posts are about how rules light/free form gaming works well for you and other people. Which is great. But there isn't really anything to respond to in that statement. I'd be happy to read about your experiences running and playing your games, but if - as above - your replies just state that the group makes decisions together without relying on any "metagaming" rules... then that's nice, but doesn't really engender debate or contribute anything to talk about.<br/><br/>So to reiterate, I'm glad that you're running and playing games you enjoy and found a rules set that fits your approach to gaming.

In my experience, when someone on SG posts some new (or in this case "new-old") rules for people to check out, the responses are far and wide positive, or at least constructive. After reading the responses to this thread though, I wondered why they were primarily negative. Everyone seemed to want to point out all the shortcomings of some very simple narrative rules. But after reading the title of the thread again, it seemed pretty obvious that the thread would be somewhat controversial. Try telling a bunch of fans of Christopher Columbus that he wasn't the first one to discover America. Whether or not people want to admit it, it's my feeling (read: opinionated observation) that some (not all obviously) folks here are resistant to the idea that someone had come up with some very "indie" rules back when role-playing games were in their infancy. I think that a lot of indie-gamers think that this new indie-movement is original and unique, and are skeptical about that idea that maybe it's not as original as they thought. I only say this because most of the responses to this thread seem to have the intention of discreditting or otherwise lowering the status of Perfected so that "it doesn't count" and therefore shouldn't be considered "the oldest narrative roleplaying game rules in the industry". Like I said, that's just my observation. I wasn't at all directing my words towards the designers, so much as what I percieved as fans of the designers. I don't want to step on anyone's toes, I'm just naturally supportive of notions that rub against the grain of the status quo.<br/><br/>EDIT: I should also mention I'm a big fan of the indie-movement. I just like to give credit where credit is due.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_346894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346894/#Comment_346894" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-25T10:48:07+00:00" title="October 25, 2011 10:48AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well this is taking a turn for the ugly.<br/><br/>Which is a shame, I think.<br/><br/>Norbert, <br/>Let me rephrase a bit, because, again, I think you're mis-reading me.<br/><br/>Please talk to me about your informal social contract stuff that you guys use, that makes this particular core mechanic a really good choice to combine with that.<br/><br/>Also, that bit where you refer to Valamir's post?

I read this thread and get an entirely different impression.  And I don't really have a dog in this fight -- I play all sorts of RPGs, and spend as much time at rpg.net as here, and I'm not a game designer.  I also started playing back in 1974 so my view point isn't particularly oriented toward the new.  What I see people asking is what are the table procedures that go along with Perfected and not being answered.  But those table procedures as much as part of play as the resolution rules.  And as described in the first post, <i>all </i>that Perfected consists of is resolution rules.  That's not exactly enough to play with.  Vague comments about "not needing rules" for the rest are not illuminating.  Could I play a game with just those by filling in pieces from other RPGs I've played?   Sure.  Would it resemble what someone else came up with in the slightest?  Probably not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_346897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346897/#Comment_346897" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-25T11:04:53+00:00" title="October 25, 2011 11:04AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alright, perhaps I'm just looking at it from the wrong direction.

I think most people here have been trying to get enough information to see how it plays.  As for why people are saying it's incomplete, it's because a resolution mechanism does not an RPG make, and that's all that's been posted.  And people bitch about incomplete rule sets all the time here if you look (the whole designer not included problem).  But this one is more incomplete than most.  Which is a pity as stories about Prof. Barker's games have leaked out over the years and they sounded wonderful.  Now a lot of it was of course his world building, but still, Perfected sounds interesting, but as described not particularly magical.<br/><br/>Also, if this wasnever really published, can they said to be in the "industry"?

Prince Valiant has been held up as a spiritual predecessor to these sorts of games since the earliest days of the Forge.  Likewise with seminal works like Pendragon.  Its long been acknowledged, embraced, and discussed that in many says story games harken back to the roots of the hobby...a kind of revival of previous design avenues that got largely squeezed out in the 90s.<br/><br/>Those of us who are familiar with the history of this community are thus rightfully pretty astonished that some would doubt our awareness of concepts that predate the community.  While I personally had not heard of this particular "rule set" I certainly am not in the least surprised to hear about it.  Of course stuff like this existed.  We're well aware of many such examples.  I am rather chuffed at your assumption that not only would we be ignorant of the hobby's roots but that we'd for some reason be resentful of them.<br/><br/>I think you need to check those assumptions at the door.<br/><br/>Thank you for bringing another great example of what designers were doing in an earlier phase of the hobby.  I'm excited to see a functional prototype of conch passing narrative rules slotted into the historical timeline.  I don't think its a particularly good rule...I think we've since seen several examples of rules that do similar things much more effectively...but its a fine example of the archetype.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_346904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346904/#Comment_346904" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-25T11:39:13+00:00" title="October 25, 2011 11:39AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: rabalias</cite>(I realise your second point kinda answered this, but it still seems strange to me.

There comes a point where things can go in different directions based on what your character does ( or presumablyevents can go). Don't overthink it or try to come up withsomething astounding to impress the group. Instead, do what seems to you to be the dead obvious thing.<br/><br/>Here's why it works: What is so simple and obvious to you may well not be obvious to everyone else, mostly because everyone has a slightly different take on characters and events. Never setting out to surprise the other players, you may well accomplish that anyway, due to the fact of those different interpretations.</i><br/><br/>Combining that concept with the simple roll off gives you surprise by two different interpretations ( both seemingly obvious to the provider, perhaps not so much to other players) and then chance deciding which becomes part of the ongoing ingame reality.<br/><br/>That's the best way I can think of to answer your question, i'm afraid.

It is the end stage on one path of natural evolution of system when you subject the system to lots of play with friends and have certain social and creative priorities. Anyone who's designed and playtested experimentally with narrativist priorities has seen Barker's system on the horizon. Games like Zak Arntson's <i>Shadows</i> and James V. West's <i>The Pool</i> don't exist in ignorance of Barker's system, but because Barker's system is so readily cultured in the lab, and because everyone has cultured it themselves they know the social and environmental conditions that kill it and are compelled to try designing different strains.<br/><br/>The pure Barker system that you've written up throws outcomes to the authority of the gamemaster and to the plane of social skills and exertion of social force among the players. For folks who don't jockey well socially, it doesn't meet their needs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_346926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346926/#Comment_346926" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-25T19:20:07+00:00" title="October 25, 2011  7:20PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think it's really an issue of social jockeying, although that is an area which can trip it up.  For me the inherent incompleteness stems from guidance for such basic things as who the players represent.<br/><br/>From the way the rule set is presented in the original post it would seem that we are meant to play the game at a purely meta level...whose view of reality prevails surely isn't a character level concern outside of Amber/Nobilis esque play.  And yet the presentation is so succinct that it leaves open the possibility that the RAW is merely shorthand and not meant to imply meta level play at all.<br/><br/>One of the problems with a meta level system that has no real teeth comes when no one is actually bringing real adversity.  When everyone is dedicated to making the other players' awesome and all are operating from appreciation of the same tropes it's easy to all just know what cool thing needs to happen next.  So I win and I just know that X is the great next twist, and you win and you just know that X is the great next twist and so essentially we're group writing a novel.<br/><br/>Contrast this paradigm with one of active character advocacy.  Where my job as a player when I win isn't to do what I think is cool or best for the "story" but to drive hard to fulfill the goals and ambitions of my character while you are driving hard to fulfill the goals and ambitions for your character.<br/><br/>Anyone whose spent any time at all thinking about such things knows that both paradigms can work but are utterly incompatible if different players are operating on different assumptions in the same game.  So which way is it?<br/><br/>That doesn't even begin to touch on whether the "version of reality" includes author/director stance powers or is strictly actor.<br/><br/>There are literally dozens of questions like that (who gets to say what when, IIEE, veto powers, on and on) that have to be answered before functional play can happen.  These are the real rules of the game, the real system being used.  I'm reasonably certain these are the sorts of things Bob's been trying to tease out.  Now clearly the answers are meant tobe filled in however your particular group wishes.  For me it's the absence of such details, or even any indication that such answers are needed that justifies references to this rule as a "toy"rather than a "game".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>The oldest "narrative" roleplaying game rules in the industry... - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15264/the-oldest-narrative-roleplaying-game-rules-in-the-industry/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content='The oldest "narrative" roleplaying game rules in the industry... - Page 2' itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15264/the-oldest-narrative-roleplaying-game-rules-in-the-industry/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Posted By: norbertgmatauschIt's not even a theory, it's a feeling.

respective session. But what I keep trying to clarify is this: Perfected doesn't need all of this. Prof. MAR Barker, for instance, did not use any of that, as far as I know. \n<blockquote><br/>Also, that bit where you refer to Valamir's post? That's part of what I'm talking about.<br/></blockquote>\nI know, komrade. But again, this is stuff *we* want to have, nothing that ought to be part of Perfected. The rules are formulated so that both blow-by-blow narration and "scene resolution" are possible.\n<blockquote><br/>Now, whether you make that a rule (hard) or a bit of suggestion/advice (soft), it's still another important tool for getting a certain kind of play.<br/></blockquote>\nBut Perfected <b>does not want</b> to get a certain kind of play. In my opinion, that's the single most important difference between Perfected and many Forge games. The group's interpretation of the rules determines the style and kind of play.

Already thanked you for it.  Could have been presented in a way that didn't involve you sitting smugly on a high horse.<br/><br/>If your agenda is to hold up this old rule as the holy grail of role playing rules and promote it, as the name implies, as the art form "perfected",  get used to disappointment.  While it deserves respect and recognition and is a fine prototype...its actually just the kernel of a game design, a pretty bland kernel at that, and without extensive effort to complete it...in the end a pretty crappy rule.  We've since produced a sizable library of games that successfully do what that rule does only better...much better.  So yeah, its super keen but hardly going to make me want to throw out all my game books and cry Eureka.<br/><br/>If your agenda is to chide us for thinking we invented this stuff and to show us up for failing to be aware of the existing heritage.  Well...bluntly...fail.  acknowledging, appreciating, and promoting that heritage has been a part of the story-games community before that phrase was even coined and before this site even existed.  "Giving credit where its due", tracing back the roots of roleplaying concepts, and mapping out a timeline and idea map of those concepts and which games shared what from where dates to some of the oldest theads and articles on the Forge.<br/><br/>So far in this thread you've attempted to pursue all three of these agendas.  I suggest you stick with the first one.

I played in groups that used almost exactly this formula discovered on our own despite never having heard of Tekumel or M.A.R Barker in the late 80's/early 90's.  As we turned more and more towards proto-narrative play we saw how all the stat blocks that the mainstream games revelled in (like D&amp;D;) were overly complicated and uninteresting to us.  Play was largely about the GM taking the dice rolls and interpreting what they meant to the game.  It depended on a ton of social balancing and dramatic situation building on the part of the gm but it was a logical consequence of a natural tendency to resort to dice rolling when something unexpected came up in a game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347060/#Comment_347060" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-27T10:07:33+00:00" title="October 27, 2011 10:07AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: UserClone</cite>Hm...how is Braunstein not an RPG?</blockquote>\nBecause it predates D&amp;D?<br/><br/>I dunno, that's all I've got.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347064/#Comment_347064" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-27T10:42:46+00:00" title="October 27, 2011 10:42AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll assume that was a joke, komradebob.

I wasn't asking why <i>you </i>don't call them humans, I was asking why science as a whole came up with specific names to denote "close-to-but-not-quite-modern-humans" as opposed to just simply referring to them as "early humans" and only that. Yes, they are sometimes loosely referred to as "early humans", but they have specific nomenclature to differentiate them for us for a reason. That said, I was not in any way saying that this is how I felt about D&amp;D/Braunstein, just offering that concept up as a reference to komradebob's assertion that Braunstein wasn't an RPG because the term wasn't coined until D&amp;D.\n<blockquote>Taking this back to the original theme: I believe the sensible way to look at role-playing games that predates D&amp;D, is that they actually are role-playing games, or games with strong and recognizable role-playing elements to them. If we do not see this, they're not interesting to us as rpgs.<br/><br/>There were no nomenclature back then, pertaining to this kind of games. The terms is seldom something you get from day one. First the thing, then the term for it. Looking back it is easy, though, to apply the term to those things predating it..</blockquote>\nThis I tend to agree with. If it looks like a duck, and tastes like a duck, then it's probably a duck even if we didn't come up with the name "duck" until later on.\n<blockquote><i>The neanderthals did not know enough to call themselves "human". But we know they were.</i></blockquote>\nMoot point, in my opinion. The naming of a species is done so entirely from the point of view of us, modern mankind. Dogs do not know enough to call themselves dogs. It doesn't matter what neanderthals called themselves. Neanderthals are considered a sub-species or a completely seperate species from modern humans because even though they shared many qualities, they had enough that was different to warrant a different species title. The same could be said, for example, about miniture games and role-playing games. They have enough in common so that they're both considered table-top games, but they have more specific and seperate names because they exhibit enough differences to warrant a differentiation.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><b>Story game = player focus on the narrative</b><br/><b>Role-playing game = player focus on the character</b></blockquote>\nThis is not a distinction, these two things are exactly the same thing. Many (most) stories are about character action and their consequences. Focusing on what a character does is focusing on what happens next in the narrative.<br/><br/>I see what he's getting at though. Even though there is some overlap, I see the difference being how the narrative is approached. Whether or not this is a rock-hard distinction is a matter of opinion, but RPG's like D&amp;D have the players thinking for the characters without regard to how their character's actions will affect the story (that's up the GM). With a story-game, the players often are encouraged to do things against their character's best interest for the sake of making a cool story. Conjecture, on my part of course.<br/><br/>I see a recurring theme of self-defined terms being taken as truth here. Typical of gamer society, if you ask me.

Story- and role-playing games are stimulating our perceptions in ways that are different. The intricate weave of player interaction is woven in different ways in these two types of games. There's a lot similar in them, but important differences too. The difference in focus in the most prominent. <br/><br/>I've been around for a while, Jason, played a lot, plunged the depths, and know it is so. There's a reason we have these two terms; some games fit the one, and some the other, and the distinction is one of principal importance to what kind of fiction these games produce. An old saying has it that <i>system matters</i>; that is true in this context too.<br/><br/>I see that you do not trust me on this, anyway, so I will leave it for you to discover on your own.

Maybe it's not having English as a native language but you and Norbert have been making some incredibly arrogant and off-putting statements.<br/><br/>When Norbert first posted I actually tried to use Google Translate to read some of his blog. The dubious translation made some of it hilarious to read but for the most part I found what he had to say there interesting. I was wishing that some of the games on his blog had English translations. After reading some of the back and forth in this thread I'm not quite as enthusiastic.<br/><br/>As far as what I have to say about Perfected, take everything Ralph said and put a "me too" behind it. I'm still waiting, as are others, for some discussion of the procedures and techniques that Norbert utilizes when using Perfected as a resolution method.<br/><br/>Also, I only get two troll posts a year and I was despairing of reaching my quota until this thread popped up.

Ok, before that "roleplaying game" was not a distinct name with a mostly agreed explanation, but if there was some precurssor, in retrospect they were roleplaying games too. It is the same with what is today called "sequential art" in English : this is a new name for "bande dessin\xe9e", or "comics", or "manga", but the fact that Rodolphe T\xf6ppfer didn't call his drawings "sequential art" doesn't negate their true nature, it was "sequential art". Point. <br/><br/>So, Braunstein 1 &amp; 4 were a "story game", perhaps even a "roleplaying game" like D&amp;D or others, and the fact that the then-not-major didn't call it an RPG doesn't matter.<br/><br/>About Perfected, well, it's the same thing. Because it was a new idea, there was no need to write down so big a ruleset as D&amp;D, and perhaps Perfected rules are the real kernel of the RPG as we see them as a whole today. When I read them, I see purity of purpose, a thing like a mathematical formula, but alas, with very little practical howtos and no recipe to use them in a real game.<br/><br/>Can we, perhaps, take Perfected as an object of thinking, and try to imagine how these few lines can be/are used in a game ?<br/><br/>(Well, sorry if I am not very clear, my English seems to be somewhat broken...)

When we're playing old school fantasy, every character gets 30 "hit points" and an "Attack" and a "Defense" value. Those numbers are only there to help me gauge a character's "efficiency" in the game (strictly in a SIM sense: how good is he at doing something). This also helps a new player to get a better feel for his character.<br/><br/>b) When everyone at the table has at least a bit of experience in roleplaying, I ask them to write up some "Good stuff" ("things" -- skills, attributes, friendships, items -- that are good for the character) and "Bad stuff" (things that are bad for the character). No numbers, though. When I need to know how good or how bad a character is at/in something, I ask the player to specifiy.<br/><br/>c) Sometimes, we don't define characters in any structured way. Players just write down the character's name and the rough concept. <br/><br/>Equipment is either bought (old school fantasy) or simply written down when it fits the character concept.<br/><br/><br/>I hope this helps?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347287">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347287/#Comment_347287" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-30T03:01:39+00:00" title="October 30, 2011  3:01AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Johnstone</cite>Hi Norbert,<br/><br/>I don't really care about most of the words in this thread, but this right here caught my attention:<br/><br/><cite>Posted By: norbertgmatausch</cite>I've been emailing with Jeff Berry, one of Mr. Barker's long-time players.</blockquote>\nNow that is stuff I'd actually like to know about!

But since I am working on a "litteral ruleset" for RPG, I am probably already convinced by your examples. <br/><br/>In game, how do you evaluate the need of a roll ? Do you have a typical frame in which you can tell "now we need to roll some dice" like a fight or something ? I'd like to know if you can write down how and when, and mainly WHY you ask for a roll.

There's no written rule that governs this kind of thing. Whenever someone at the table feels there should be a roll, we roll. Sometimes it happens that the majority of players expresses the wish to continue without rolling.

It had no practical use other than for trade; how better can you define currency?</blockquote>\nI'll let myself get a little nit-picky here. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wampum" rel="nofollow">Wampum</a> was only really anything like currency to Europeans. Europeans defined it with an exchange rate and saw no other value in it, but to Natives, it was actually a medium used for representation of concepts. In fact, the first treaty between Europeans and the Native People of North America was recorded on a wampum belt, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Row_Wampum_Treaty" rel="nofollow">Two Row Wampum Treaty</a>, and is considered the legal foundation for all further treaties between Europeans and Natives. <br/><br/>The use of wampum as currency was adopted by Native people when dealing with Europeans only because the Europeans seemed so obsessed with using it as such. In Native circles, it was a sacred medium for recording very important concepts, like treaties or contracts. Sorta like how they used to make people swear on the Bible in courts of law. It leant gravity to any agreements when the event was recorded on a wampum belt. Seeing the seriousness with which the Natives took wampum, the difficulty of manufacturing it, and the exchange of wampum during gatherings, like many other things in Native culture, Europeans totally misinterpreted it, and that misinterpretation has been continued in "history books" ever since.<br/><br/>/rant<br/><br/>Now back to your regularly scheduled flame war.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/norbertgmatausch" title="norbertgmatausch"><img alt="norbertgmatausch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/412/n6C0O3XAEQ2GP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/norbertgmatausch">norbertgmatausch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347296/#Comment_347296" name="Item_110" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-30T05:45:12+00:00" title="October 30, 2011  5:45AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Naughty Europeans!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347301/#Comment_347301" name="Item_111" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-30T07:23:22+00:00" title="October 30, 2011  7:23AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A question about character creation.

I don't mean to delve too deeply into your group's social dynamics, but what happens when a player finds his intuition at odds with the intuition of the rest of the group and/or the system?  Have you ever had a player who seems opposed to the content of the games you play, your group's style of play, or the system you use?  If so, how was that player handled by the group at large?  Or does the system handle it?      <br/>\n<br/>\nI know the "why" and "when" of you call for rolls as the GM has been asked, but I was hoping you could elaborate: what kinds of scenes would you say, generally, involve rolls?

I am curious what specific things you see as emerging from the Perfected rules?<br/><br/>To me it seems like the opposite of Go. Go's rules produce the things you are talking about -- by being very specific and covering 100% of all possible game cases. Perfected's rules don't cover most of the game cases (as the OP's responses about his own play using Perfected make very clear), so the behaviours they produce are not emergent from the specificity of the rules but from the large gaps implied by a) the premise that there should be some sort of game happening and b) all the things not covered by the rules that are required to fulfill that premise. <br/><br/>Go's rules do not, to my knowledge, require players to make additional judgment calls outside of the rules, for example. They cover all possible game states. Whereas pretty much all roleplaying games do require these judgment calls (which is part of what makes them fun to play) and Perfected does to a nearly limitless degree.<br/><br/>Edit: Go's rules have probably also produced lots of things in the same way, that's just not mostly what Go is about. But for example, handicapping systems in Go seem like a good example of a set of rules that have emerged <i>around</i> the central rules of Go, rather than <i>from</i> them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_348066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/edomaur" title="edomaur"><img alt="edomaur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/182385/apple_scale_avatar.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/edomaur">edomaur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348066/#Comment_348066" name="Item_125" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-06T01:15:20+00:00" title="November  6, 2011  1:15AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<sup>(Sorry I am a bit late : I am working in parallel on four games and if my brain can follow, my hands cannot)</sup><br/><br/>I was thinking about Go because there is some judgement you have to made based on your perception of the game and that are not in the core rules : anything involving "influence" or "life by form" above some basic complexity are more some kind of consequence of the game Go is and how it is played, than fixed by rules. There is a whole lot of books theorizing the mecanisms of Go, but they are not the rules.<br/><br/>So as I see it, Perfected is similar because the rules themselves arent' very helpfull in how they are/can be used. To start a game with Perfected, you have to imply the use of a set of "practical rules". Mmh, it's a bit like the difference between the Law formalizing how things are, and the rules explaining how to use the Law.<br/><br/>What I think is really interesting about this is that you can focus on the interpretation of Perfected and see if the players made a set of "practical rules" totally by themselves, use something they already knew (D&amp;D ?), change these "practical rules" as they wish, and so on. I do not see anything specific growing from Perfected, no, what I see is "things growing" from a limited set of rules and I am very much interested to konw what king of things these are and if we can generalise them as a kind of "default rpg gameset" or a set of ideas and theories similar in scope to what exists for Go and probably other games.<br/><br/><sub>(As always, my English is trying very hard to convey my ideas, I am working on it...)</sub> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349665/#Comment_349665" name="Item_126" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-25T09:55:25+00:00" title="November 25, 2011  9:55AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: norbertgmatausch</cite>... are professor M.A.R.

Lets say you all start with ten tokens in a GM less game. Every time two participants have a conflict, follow these steps:<br/><br/>1) The "instigator" of the conflict bet any number of that person's tokens.<br/>2) The "defender" may call with the same number of tokens to narrate the outcome. The instigator gets the pot.<br/>3) If the defender doesn't call, the instigator will loose what it bet to the defender, but gets to narrate the outcome.<br/>4) If the bet in combination with the outcome of the conflict is unfair, we negotiate.<br/><br/>With these rules, the players have a lot of decision to make in comparison to a dice roll. How important is the conflict? What consequence will it bring to loose to many tokens?

Barker, author of the RPG "Empire of the Petal Throne" and creator of the world-setting of Tekumel. He got his doctorate in linguistics, doing work on the Klamath language that is still used by the Klamath tribe today. He was, for many years, head of the Department of South Asian Studies at the University of Minnesota, and was a full Professor from 1972 until his recent death. We always addressed him as "professor" when we gamed with him, until he asked us to use his birth name of "Phil".<br/><br/>You are entirely correct about the way Phil used his system; he used this as a mechanic while he was telling us stories about his world.<br/><br/>yours, chirine                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chirinebakal" title="chirinebakal"><img alt="chirinebakal" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chirinebakal">chirinebakal</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435809/#Comment_435809" name="Item_134" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-26T05:45:05+00:00" title="July 26, 2014  5:45AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm sorry for the thread revival - necromancy - but if folks want to see how we still play Braunsteins here in the Twin Cities, please have a look at some video clips of our recent antics:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5j719bJaTY2MnreQ0oKH9A" rel="nofollow">youtube.com/channel/UC5j719bJaTY2MnreQ0oKH9A</a><br/><br/>I also have a blog, and I am currently doing a series of posts about how I run Braunsteins:<br/><br/><a href="http://chirinesworkbench.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">chirinesworkbench.blogspot.com/</a><br/><br/>- chirine                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436639">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Calithena" title="Calithena"><img alt="Calithena" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Calithena">Calithena</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436639/#Comment_436639" name="Item_135" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-07T10:53:36+00:00" title="August  7, 2014 10:53AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess one thing I would have wanted to emphasize if I had been in on this discussion is that in a game like this, the world itself is part of the 'system.' It is not an accident, I think, that a lot of the 'old school' games I played in that pushed in a mechanics light/'talking adventure'/freeform direction, or toward certain more recently named techniques, were ones in which there was a very detailed setting, either a 'literary' one such as Middle Earth or Tekumel, or one crafted in play through a long 'campaign' of adventures.<br/><br/>If you sit down and go into a dungeon and all you know is, she's a fighter, he's a wizard, she's a bugbear assassin-illusionist, etc., that kind of system does not cut it. (I mean, you can have fun that way I'm sure like anything else, but it will be unprogrammed fun until you figure out how to play that way as a group.) If you have a highly detailed world with magic, mythology, social mores, and the rest well understood at the level of imagination, then much simpler systems can be used to satisfyingly negotiate that material.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rotting_Zombie" title="Rotting_Zombie"><img alt="Rotting_Zombie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rotting_Zombie">Rotting_Zombie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437121/#Comment_437121" name="Item_136" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-12T17:51:18+00:00" title="August 12, 2014  5:51PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bump!<br/><br/>I find this Perfected system pretty cool.
