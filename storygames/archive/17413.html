The other participants are random elements as well, but for this threads sake they are considered "non-random".</i><br/><br/>Imagine that your character will always succeed at any task. What fun would it be if there weren't any obstructions in the game at all? I will talk about five different techniques you can use for creating obstructions for the character, but actually challenging the player.<br/><br/><b>Descriptive challenge</b><ul>"Tell me how you open the locked door, using a banana."</ul>To challenge a player in a descriptive way is something you've done a lot of times without thinking of it. It comes naturally to improvise a dialogue with your players or asking the players to tell something about their background, make them create relationships with your characters or within themselves. It's not that hard, to be honest, because they can always draw inspiration from the context.<br/><br/>So how can you increase the level of difficulty? By introducing things that the players aren't prepared for, and have to involve in their answer. Asking a player to describe where the character is hiding isn't that hard if the character is in a forest. What happens if the environment is on a grass plain with no trees or rocks? Let the players take care the the description of their actions. Throw in elements that they have to consider, like the banana, when they describe their actions.<br/><br/>Let also the players describe the surroundings and things in the environment, but give them restrictions of some sort. Perhaps they have to show despair in all their descriptions or perhaps you say something like "You find a paper on the ground. <i>It's a flyer of some sort</i> What does it say?".<br/><br/>Ask all kinds of questions to the players to challenge them in a descriptive way:<br/>- How do you all know each other?<br/>- Why are you at the cemetery at midnight?<br/>- Why are you looking for the golden Buddha statue?<br/>- What caused the sun eclipse?<br/><br/>You can also put the characters in all sorts of situations and let the players describe their way out of it. My favourite move is to throw a character off a cliff and let the player describe why the character isn't falling to a certain death. You can do this in a dialogue as well, where an NPC makes an accusation that the player has to respond to.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>This is the first of five ways to create a non-random obstruction that makes it harder for the player to succeed.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394390/#Comment_394390" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-22T20:24:34+00:00" title="October 22, 2012  8:24PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 23, 2012 7:19AM by Rickard.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Imagine that your character will always succeed at any task.

Your lover or the antidote?"</ul>Batman can fight heaps of minions without breaking a sweat, but when he meets the Joker it seems like the villain always has a card up his sleeve, forcing Batman to make a choice between different options. Options that gives consequences if they are not chosen, perhaps letting the Joker escape. Some RPGs has this in the basic structure of creating the PC, where for example a police officer perhaps start with two goals: one to arrest a criminal mind and one to find his lost mother. At the end, it turns out that the mother is the criminal mind. Is his love for the mother greater than his duty as a police?<br/><br/>Colliding options doesn't have to be about moral questions. Lets say that the characters got an item in their possession and several groups wants it for it's own purpose. Who should the characters side with? By creating a fish tank with different kind of factions with their own agendas, you create options. What do I mean with this? A <a href="http://www.gnomestew.com/gming-advice/the-fish-tank-as-a-mystery-2" rel="nofollow">fish tank</a> is a model for adventure writing that consist of relations between different faction.

Mustard and the wrench."</ul>The fish tank is also great when it come to adventures that demands investigation, like a murder case. You have created a lot of faction with relations to each other and every time the players interact with a faction, you reveal at least one relation to the players. Based on the clues (the relations), the players can then draw a conclusion. You can also combine two adventures so the players has to sort out what clue goes to what adventure.<br/><br/>The thing with clue-based challenges is that the players are the ones who has to come up with the connections by putting the pieces together. "If Col. Mustard is blackmailing Margaret, could this mean that..?" As soon as the players think they got things right, it's time for part two: how to actually solve the problem. Just because they know what's been going on, doesn't mean that they will solve it automatically.<br/><br/>Humans always looks for patterns in everything. Use this to your advantage if you haven't got anything prepared. Make up some events, create some factions that could be related to the events, and make the players come up with the connections. This will make them create the adventure for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394657">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394657/#Comment_394657" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-24T13:46:53+00:00" title="October 24, 2012  1:46PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 18, 2012 10:37AM by Rickard.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>When I say "non-random" I mean any kind of random element outside the group itself. Dices, cards, drawing sentences...</i><br/><br/><b>Resource-managing options</b><ul>"I could try to get that flanking bonus, but that will leave me exposed to other people flanking me."</ul>Resources can come in all kind of shapes. Equipment, skill points, hit points, temporary bonuses, relations, minions, points for narrative control, spotlight moments, information gathered during the session and so on. They can be expendable, be activated or become useless in certain circumstances, or be permanent but bought on beforehand. The pawns in chess are for example resources that sometimes may be expendable for a greater cause. There are three things in the area of resources that I want to highlight.<br/><br/>- <i>Resources and capacity. </i>Capacity is the number of times you can do something during a certain time, perhaps a round, a day or a session. To low and you can't do anything and to big and it's mostly a waste of capacity, because you can't use it all up. Mana in Magic the Gathering is a typical example of capacity, where you need lands that produce mana but not to many because they will take up "space" in your deck and sometimes make you do nothing in a turn. You want that sweet spot where you can spend enough resources each turn. Dominion is another example that handles capacity well (fortune contra action cards). Another take on capacity is Fate points in Warhammer FRPG 3 that replenish after each session, so you should use all your Fate points each session or they will be there for no reason. How can capacity otherwise be a factor with for example resources like relations, spotlight moments or equipment? <br/>- <i>Rotting resources.</i> Resources can sometimes turn useless after a while. If the players has dug up dirty information about a VD on a company and the company change who's in charge, their information will turn useless. Sudden shifts in the fiction will change what the players can do with their resources. Another example of rotting resources is when the capacity is to low and you can't collect more resources. This means that you can to get rid of a few of your resources without any real loss.<br/>- <i>Consequences.</i> Resources is mostly about risk taking. Should you spend your resources now or later? When is it the best time to do it? Should you spend your resources to gain something big now and render you vulnerable for a while or should you try to control something small from this moment on? What will the opponents do? What will the consequences be?<br/><br/>Time is a resource that sometimes occur in scenarios. You must perhaps to solve a problem in a certain time, perhaps before you get caught. Things can also change over time and, like in the example above, render information useless. New opportunities may arise - should you jump on that track or stay with your chosen path? Time can only be something you can spend, for example divide time between different ways to prepare. You know that the monster is allergic to silver, should you try to get more information about the monster or spend time preparing to meet either a werewolf or a vampire?<br/><br/>[edit] <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/397953#Comment_397953" rel="nofollow">Another example of a resource-managing option</a>.

What I'm going to talk about now is more a reward than actually a challenge.  A player who likes to take on a role doesn't need experience points to raise a character's stats, because that's a <i>mechanical reward</i>. Instead, the reward for this type of player is to be in situations where the player gets to act out. Where the character's personality traits are first established and then perhaps questioned. When the traits are turned against the players. How is the character's way of be affecting in the person's presence?<br/><br/>Also note how the immersive challenge can be combined with colliding options.

It all started when I was writing on a roleplaying game that made the characters succeed all the time. I felt kind of helpless at first, because my thoughts of obstructions back then was to roll the die. That was my challenge for the players, when it's actually no challenge for them at all. It's just a piece of plastic that they throw.<br/><br/>Over the years, these methods had come to form a theory about how to engage the players. I will perhaps talk about that in a later post. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote>- creative generation: how awesome/appropriate a fictional thing can you make up on the spot?<br/>- value judgment: can you make a meaningful decision about which of two things is more important to you?<br/>- induction: can you synthesize from a bunch of facts what the pattern is?<br/>- deduction: given facts/patterns, can you apply them to solve a specific problem?<br/>- system mastery: can you optimize the outcome of a system with multiple interacting moving parts?<br/>- expression: how well can you bring your ideas to life for an audience?</blockquote>\nI like this list. Never really thought about it that way. Value judgement could be be defined even a little more: "can you make a meaningful decision about which of two things is more important to <i>the group</i>?", because it's possible to create a stake or or collision between two different players values.<br/><br/>System mastery stands out a little bit compared to the other players skills. It depends on how you define "system", because resource management can involve scenarios as well. I had a hard time not just talking about board- and card games, that use this very kind of player skill in a really refined way. I think roleplaying game designer (and computer game designers) has a lot to learn from how one should create boardgames.\n<blockquote>creative generation: how awesome/appropriate a fictional thing can you make up on the spot?</blockquote>\nOne part of this is something I'm actually been discovering these last months, while playing <b>Polaris</b> and <b>Archipelago</b>. Both those games gives you only fragments of a scenario and then you (as a group) has to make up adventures on the spot. I actually think this part is that important that I will make it into a totally new category. A lot of games has this in the preparation, like <b>In a Wicked Age</b> or <b>Apocalypse World</b>, where you create enough stuff so you can play. In IAWA* and AW*, it's by creating elements that will take place in the story and then thinking of how they relate to each other, but I think it's possible to make this even with a dungeon crawl. Or I don't "think", I <i>know</i>; the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvANYBRWo" rel="nofollow">Dirty Dungeon</a> is exactly that and I guess <b>Donjon</b> is perhaps like that as well (never read the game though).<br/><br/>What makes Polaris and Archipelago unique is that the scenario creation isn't part of any preparation, it's actually taking form when you're playing the game.<br/><br/>Thanks for the comment. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>* I haven't read neither of IAWA or AW, but I've played IAWA once, read a lot about AW and watched it being played once.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396362/#Comment_396362" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-05T09:45:12+00:00" title="November  5, 2012  9:45AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 24, 2013 9:49AM by Rickard.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>I will talk about five different techniques you can use for creating obstructions for the character, but actually challenging the player.</i><br/><br/>But why should the players even care about your obstructions? Why shouldn't they just turn their back and try another way instead? To lure the players in, you need to create an investment; something that the players put some effort in, so that they feel like they are loosing something if you remove it. The character is one example. You can always put the character's life at stake, which is an investment often used in horror games like Call of Cthulhu. The more time you spend on your investment, the more you bond with it. So having the character creation taking hours to go through isn't really a bad thing if you want to use the character's life as an investment.<br/><br/>Here are some other areas that are typical investments.<br/><br/><b>The character's inner and outer sphere</b>, such as ...<br/>... self respect.<br/>... drives. Goals that can be fulfilled in the short or long term.<br/>... moral.<br/>... the time it takes to build relations.<br/>... family and different kind of groups that the player has created.<br/>... status.<br/>... the loyalty against different factions.<br/>... and other things that the player, through the character, care about.<br/><br/><b>The game mechanics</b>, meaning ...<br/>... resource management, with finite resources.<br/>... resources that you can put at stake to either gain more or loose.<br/>... the character's competence.<br/>... the character's advancement.<br/>... the character's health.<br/>... and other things that is a part of the character's freedom to do whatever it want.<br/><br/><b>The gaming experience</b>, with things like ...<br/>... positive engagement, where you care because the things happening are so god damn cool.<br/>... control over the narrative.<br/>... the time an adventure takes to play.<br/>... positive feedback from the others.<br/>... emotional investments, where what you play out get a response.<br/>... sharing experience/background from real life with what happens in the game.<br/>... spending time creating things.<br/>... and other things that is happening around the table.<br/><br/>I want to pick out two words in that last sentence: "time" and "create". By having the players spend time on something, you raise the players' investment. Dogs in the Vineyard uses this, where the first scene is about how the character becoming a dog and also gives a backstory to one of  the traits. By doing this, you automatically get a larger investment for that trait. In Call of Cthulhu, it's always someone's (unknown) uncle that is in some sort of trouble. There isn't any investment in this. Instead, the player should create some of their relatives, and to further increase the investment, have the GM play out a scene with the character and the relative.<br/><br/>Now, take any of these investments and put them in situations where the players may loose them. It doesn't have to mean kill or destroy, but perhaps a person is rejecting the PC, perhaps it's imprisoned because of the PC or perhaps the investment is going to change somehow.<br/><br/>How can you create a descriptive challenge by putting one of the player's investments at risk?<br/>Can you use two or more investments to create a colliding option?<br/>How can the investments interfere with a clue-based challenge?<br/>Can an investment be part of a resource-managing option?<br/>How can investments create an immersive challenge?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397000/#Comment_397000" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-10T07:19:45+00:00" title="November 10, 2012  7:19AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great thread, really enjoying reading along.<br/><br/>That last post brings up an interesting point for me:<br/><br/>These "obstructions" (challenges, obstacles, dangers) also benefit from player input, in much the same way.<br/><br/>Many (all?) of these techniques can be turned on the players. Ask them what they'd be willing to give up in order to have a certain thing, then add a little to it and throw the question at them. Ask them who's stopping them from achieving a certain goal, and why they hate them so much. Ask them what they find most mysterious about a certain situation or character. And so on.<br/><br/>They're also great ways for the players to challenge each other: it doesn't always have to be the GM's toolkit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397190/#Comment_397190" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-12T07:53:12+00:00" title="November 12, 2012  7:53AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 17, 2012 2:58PM by Rickard.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>They're also great ways for the players to challenge each other: it doesn't always have to be the GM's toolkit.</blockquote>\nYes, you're absolutely right. I've written these techniques both from the perspective of GM and game designer, and I sort of gathered player-created obstructions in the game design category. Most recently, I've played Bad Family where you can find a structure where a player is asked what's stopping the character from reaching it's goal, and there are a lot of these player-created obstructions in other GM less games as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jbinc" title="jbinc"><img alt="jbinc" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/106/nFRMKD4VH4ILG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jbinc">jbinc</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397587/#Comment_397587" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-15T08:27:18+00:00" title="November 15, 2012  8:27AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread's inspired me to make a new list of my player's investments - and how they might lose them!
