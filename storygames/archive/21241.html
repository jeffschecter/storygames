It would be petty and useless and a total waste of my time and energy. So please believe me when I say, it is not about that.<br/><br/>I want to open this thread because I see the incident with my article as a symptom of a more widespread behaviour that worries me. Both in this community, and on G+ and FB and across some blogs too.<br/>I don't expect to change minds with this post. Of course. But I believe that positive change starts by giving voice to doubts and criticism, so that they can eventually be worked out. Maybe it is just me. Maybe someone else will find my words worth of consideration.<br/>I hope for this post to start a civil conversation: agree, disagree, what could be done about it, etc.<br/><br/>I will start by taking a brief look at my "scandalous" design article, as a practical and safe example.<br/>"Safe" for reason I'll explain towards the end of this post. <br/><br/>It should come as no surprise to anyone that has at least once attempted to express an idea through an article or blog post, that only through later discussion it will be easy to distil a long article into a clearer and more concise form... a nutshell... the article writer will/should try to do this to begin with, but in the end the whole article IS their way to express the idea as clearly as possible.<br/><br/>In my case, here it is:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>I also think <a href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana">@ValyrianSteelKatana</a> is quite right in that a lot more innovation might take place in the OSR world if people were more willing to experiment with new designs and <b>shake off traditions</b>. There is a lot happening already, but it tends to be <b>small-scale</b> rather than large-scale.<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nThis!<br/>Bold highlights are mine.<br/>The design article that had so many people enraged actually boiled down to THIS. Nothing more.<br/>I expressed this observation, and tried to develop the argument to support such observation, so that readers might understand where I came from and agree or disagree on the merit of the discussion. In addition, I expressed perplexity that in all our indie scene there was not already more going on in this direction.<br/><br/>Now, while I am sure that my communication was far from perfect, I have the distinct feeling that very little charitable reading was applied in reading my article. Rather, effort was put into expressing one's individual rage and consternation is a civilised and proper way. <b>Reading charitably</b> and <b>raging in a urbane way</b> are not the same thing. And I'm seeing this happening more and more often in the widespread "indie" community.<br/><br/>It's a weird feeling.<br/>Everyone talks about inclusiveness, safe spaces, mutual understanding.<br/>And then?<br/>Flaming, raging and rising shields in front of something just because it is presented with an imperfect writing tone/style ... no matter what the honest and genuine contents might be; no matter all the lines of text explicitly saying "<i>Your fun is OK, your games are OK, I'm saying a different thing!</i>".<br/><br/>In the past few years I believe I noticed two concurrent phenomenons feeding each other in having a negative effect on the community.<br/><br/>For one, people seem to be developing <b>thinner skin</b>.<br/>Everyone is much more prone to be offended than before, content is becoming less important than proper tone, being critical of something is automatically seen badly and unless the form of this critique is flawless ... bam.<br/><br/>I get it. Internet has become an incredibly toxic environment over time, with trolls as kings of the hill.<br/>But it's unthinkable to address this problem by reacting with force against anything that causes anyone to somehow feel offended or upset. Which in turn causes its own unique kind of peer pressure, mobbing and abuse. <b>Safety from trolling</b> and <b>ostracising deviant opinions</b> are not the same thing.<br/><br/>On one hand A LOT of honest and intelligent and valuable conversations happen outsides people's comfort zone, or go and poke at someone's beliefs and values.<br/><br/>On the other hand A LOT of shit and abuse can happen easily if people look mainly at the form, rather than at the substance, of things.<br/><br/>And this is the other problem.<br/>People seem to be <b>losing the ability to distinguish</b> between a constructive critique and a trolling, or between a dissonant idea (an idea different than yours, an idea you disagree with) and a trolling, or between an earnest argument and an aggressive attack.<br/><br/>Sure, half of the responsibility lays on the shoulder of the one trying to communicate something. Charitable reading can not be an excuse for being carelessly rude, venomous or destructive.<br/>But the way to face something expressed in a less than optimal way is to point these flaws out AND THEN go on discussing the content, not to read the flawed form AS the content.<br/><br/>This is not what I see happening.<br/>And it's getting worse.<br/>It is my personal perception of something that has been creeping up at the periphery of my senses in the past few years. Unfortunately I can only offer the incident with my aforementioned article as a <b>safe</b> example. I could mention a bunch of other instances, but I choose here not to because I don't want the topic to derail from the matter at hand towards the specific minutiae of those instances. They were hugely inflamed events that split hard the community and were never solved, simply lost momentum after enough time had passed, so I don't think it's worth to rekindle such embers.<br/><br/>Besides, it is not my aim here prove that what I say is right.<br/>If my words make sense to you, good.<br/>If they don't, maybe it's just me misunderstanding stuff and projecting my personal demons outwardly. Fair enough.<br/>Either way I just felt important to express this.<br/>And sorry for the long winded post.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465399">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465399/#Comment_465399" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-09T12:33:10+00:00" title="August  9, 2017 12:33PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I disagreed with everything you said in the blog.

If you write something that poorly, you shoulder the responsibility for people treating it like a Rorschach blot. <br/><br/>2) As regarding this post: I agree, save that it's wider than just the indie scene. The indie scene seems to be worse, but not unique. This is related to the wider internet culture in some way. I think SG might be a little more intense on this topic simply because the population of the forum has fallen so low that there's a pretty narrow scope of POVs remaining: responses are going to come with a certain homogeneity. Which is ok, too: I know what I'm getting at SG, and that's what I visit for. There's no point in complaining that SG is itself.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer" title="Dreamer"><img alt="Dreamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer">Dreamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465403/#Comment_465403" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-09T14:18:33+00:00" title="August  9, 2017  2:18PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 9, 2017 2:21PM by Dreamer.">edited August 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a saying I've seen around that goes: "The meaning of your communication is the response you get", so I agree with the opinion that you should assume some responsibility for the reaction you elicited. <br/><br/>I don't think that accusing a group of people of being stuck in the past is the best way to get a calm discussion started unless they already agree with you, but for some reason you consciously chose to frame things that way. I have a hard time believing that you were unaware that it would ruffle some feathers, so I feel like you were courting controversy. I honestly don't think that's very conducive to productive conversation, though it will get you a lot of reactions.<br/><br/>That being said, I would have preferred that your post remain open, on principle. I will point out that your blog does not seem to allow comments, however, so your criticism brings to mind rocks, glass houses and all that.<br/><br/>Edit: I just want to add that I enjoy your blog and your ideas on design a lot.

It's real, but probably not something that we can influence in any way except by being aware of it and trying to be better people individually. The sheer width of the open discourse spaces we deal with today does privilege all sorts of shouting, posturing, outrage, snap judgements and so on.<br/><br/>The quick fix solution is to stop getting involved with Internet 2.0, of course. Would save us all a lot of headache, and perhaps remove one bad habit on the way of developing personal virtue. I already cut down a lot of my own engagement half a decade back, and think that the solution has been a net positive for me. Unfortunately this "brain drain" phenomenon where the people with a whit of sense or sensibility abandon the community does little to improve what remains [grin].<br/><br/>Utopianism is another approach: start new discussion spaces and develop them into communities that uphold better values than the wider Internet. It's a lot of work, though, and although there is wide agreement that something's wrong (in comparison to our old-fashioned flesh relationships), everybody seems to have their own opinions on the particulars. Even in this practical case study half of the populace seems to think that you were in the wrong in posting a controversial opinion, while the other half thinks that moderation shouldn't be based on avoiding controversy. And that's just the big picture, I'm sure you'd find quite a range of specific opinions on how to run a forum if you went looking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465406/#Comment_465406" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-09T16:57:55+00:00" title="August  9, 2017  4:57PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">@Hasimir</a>: If you want to have discussions about whatever part of OSR design you want, have at it.

Stirring opinions is all right, just don't expect people to read charitably, prepare for the worst and hope for the best.

I'm pessimistically used to "tone policing" happening in progressive circles online, but not here. It appears that on a moderated forum there's no need to start a witch-hunt against someone expressing an unpopular opinion, since the mere potential for controversy can influence the mod to pre-emptively stop the discussion. That seems even worse somehow.<br/><br/>I am really uncomfortable with "______ is a historically terrible type of conversation" as a rationale for shutting down a conversation <i>before</i> anything terrible occurs. Especially given how subjective a decision this is. To me, "scene X is not doing good design" seems like a really meaty thing to dig into, with all sorts of opportunities to clarify what the boundaries of scene X are, what kinds of design is going on, what criteria we judge its goodness on.<br/><br/>I totally understand that when people talk about deep personal issues like race, gender and sexuality there is enormous potential for hurt and harm. But doods, we are talking about fucking tabletop games here. And not even the full games, but the mechanics behind them. If dice-rolling and stat-allocating are widely seen as fraught topics that people could get hurt by, someone is taking this far too seriously. (And yes, I have been online for 35 years and totally understand that people do take things far too seriously.

I haven't read the thread you mentioned, but thought I'd comment on your other concerns. <br/><br/>Where I agree with you:<br/><br/>I think that there can be an excessive and unhealthy impulse born out of good-will and empathy to shut down conversations that can be even slightly emotionally challenging. I come from an older generation and I think that sometimes challenging, and even reasonably emotionally difficult, conversations help people grow and are necessary for personal development; however, I don't agree that this is an issue on the Story Games forums. On Story Games the default is respect and I find it very refreshing. Also, obviously, it is not the place for emotionly difficult conversations. If you understand the personality type of people high in creativity, which we in the indie game's scene typically are, you can understand why sometimes the speech policing goes overboard in certain settings. People high in creativity are high in Openess in the Big 5 personality traits, and are typically very empathetic (as well as intelligent <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title=":smiley:"/>) people. Sometimes we see empathy as the end all value; but sometimes being overly empathic can actually hurt people. Take the case of an overly empathetic mother/father who shelters and does everything for their child. This makes the child unprepared for the challenges of the world and ends up hurting the child in the end. Empathy is not the only value. But, importantly, I don't see this as an issue in the Story Game forums...it may be an issue in other parts of the indie scene but I don't feel qualified to comment about that.<br/><br/>As an aside, if folks want to take a scientifically validated Big 5 Personality Test they can do so at the link below. It is free and you can learn a lot about yourself:<br/><a href="http://www.outofservice.com/bigfive/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.outofservice.com/bigfive/</a><br/><br/>Where we may see things differently(?):<br/><br/>I think tone policing in a forum can be of value. There are past members of this community that were banned and I feel it was appropriate; for example, there was a person who was banded who framed every discussion as an argument and was without fail vitriolic in their approach...Story Games is for people who want to discuss things not have arguments and I appreciate that. <br/><br/>I think another good unwritten rule is that we don't attack each other's games. It is okay to carefully and respectfully talk about design choices and how things worked for us, but we do this with the knowledge that we, as the different games' designers, all frequent this forum. I don't want to lose the valuable opinions and insights of other designers because someone was overly critical or attacked one of there games. Plus people put their hearts and souls into these things; many times developing them over the course of years. We are a small community and I think it is important that we take these things into consideration. I don't like it when someone says they don't like an indie game or its design without saying why and doing so carefully. <br/><br/>I may very well be misunderstanding the issues and where you are coming from, and the context of the issue and your comments. Sorry if that is the case; if I'm missing the point please let me know so I can give you a more useful response <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/>. My comments are meant to be constructive and I hope they are <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/>.<br/><br/>All that said, I have always enjoyed the discussions you've taken part in on Story Games and I find you contributions valuable. I enjoy reading your games and considering there designs, as I enjoy reading all of our games and considering their designs. I like you and I'm glad you are part of these forums. <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title=":smiley:"/> <br/><br/>P.S.

I haven't read the original post and I don't think I need to, but I've read everything here from the  OP down, and you know what?  <b>I agree with everyone who has spoken above.</b><br/><br/>Anyone who knows me will recognize how unusual *that* is. :-)<br/><br/>Yes, the phenomenon <a href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">@Hasimir</a> describes is much broader than S-G or the RPG community.  It's a cultural phase, and heaven knows where it will lead.  So while care must be taken to communicate online these days, especially for those with highly individualistic positions, it's also true that some serious consideration needs to be placed on tone, context and location - i.e. there are things one wouldn't say in certain groups, there are things one wouldn't say in front of one's grandparents, etc. - or at the very least, one would find a different way to say them.<br/><br/>I would like to hope that, once our culture has internalized the full message of postmodernism - i.e. it is not enough to simply turn convention on its head and eschew all classical definitions of value, rather it is a question of navigating multiple relative centers of value depending on context - we will be able to relax again and stop tiptoeing around each other so fearfully.<br/><br/>I don't post here enough and sometimes S-G ticks me off, but I really do love you guys.  This thread - if not its forebear - has reminded me of that again.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465429/#Comment_465429" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-10T00:48:43+00:00" title="August 10, 2017 12:48AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/AsIf" rel="nofollow">AsIf</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>i.e. there are things one wouldn't say in certain groups, there are things one wouldn't say in front of one's grandparents, etc. - or at the very least, one would find a different way to say them.<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nI wonder to what extent this "problem" has come into being because of new ways of communicating.<br/><br/>For example, it's easy to start to think that "in the past, you could say anything you wanted! There was no language police!" However, sit down in a room with your grandparents for a few hours, and tell me that's still the case. Chances are that there are *all kinds* of unwritten rules about what you're allowed to say and what you're not allowed to bring up... it's just that you don't have to think about them very hard.<br/><br/>It's just that our rules for what kind of communication is appropriate are much less useful in a format where all kinds of people from all over the world are suddenly talking to each other. Now, instead of being able to fairly unconsciously "know" what's inappropriate to say in front of a group of older people from a particular culture, we are often in environments where we have no idea who's listening or what their standards are. <br/><br/>In places where people are willing to learn from the experience (like here!), I think that's generally a good thing. I am a big believer in freedom of speech and expression, but that doesn't mean there's nothing to be gained by learning how to present those same ideas in ways which are polite, proper, humble, and open-minded.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to seeing what the future brings - hopefully we'll all get better at this as time goes by.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465430/#Comment_465430" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-10T01:26:27+00:00" title="August 10, 2017  1:26AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 10, 2017 2:47AM by Jeff_Slater.">edited August 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            .<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teylen" title="Teylen"><img alt="Teylen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teylen">Teylen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465432/#Comment_465432" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-10T09:34:55+00:00" title="August 10, 2017  9:34AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find myself in full agreement with <a href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">@James_Stuart</a>.<br/>Online discussions are always a challenge.

It's comforting to see I'm not imagining things.<br/><br/>One thing that pushed me to make this post in the first place was a totally unexpected consequence of my article. I made the same post both here on SG and on RPGnet. I expected to have a deeper design discussion here, and something more superficial and rougher on RPGnet.<br/><br/>Imagine my surprise when here a flame exploded so fast and violent that the thread got closed, while on RPGnet (a bastion of "trad" gaming) people managed to discuss much more reasonably: sure a lot of people basically disagreed with my post (not all, though <img alt=":wink:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=":wink:"/> ) but no one felt offended, no one thought it was an inflammatory article, and actually it turned into a very interesting conversation about games I never heard of and about fringe elements of the OSR that are trying to innovate (although without really breaking the original mold).<br/><br/>Same happened in other circles, like FB groups, were I actually cashed in positive comments along with the expected "<i>you know nothing of OSR, Hasimir Snow!</i>".<br/><br/>So I was like: wait, what's happening on SG?!?! o_O<br/><br/>This mixed bag of results gives me hope that, in the end, my article wasn't after all 99% noise.<br/>Many of you mention the title as inflammatory.<br/>But... seriously?<br/>"<i>OSR design is stuck in the past ... and it's a pity</i>"<br/>It sure is a strong statement.<br/>But... asserting that OSR design is not moving past its original roots should at most have people say "<i>dah-ha it's what OSR is all about, what did you expect? Dummy!</i>" which is by far and large what happened on RPGnet.<br/>But being offended by that?<br/><br/>The article itself does NOT criticise people that play OSR, nor OSR design.<br/>It describes what everyone agrees to anyway: some games are just clones of the old originals, some games are more polished and have minor innovations but don't really break the original mold, some games celebrate the look of old dungeoneering but do a totally different thing.<br/>How this is offensive to people, is beyond me.<br/><br/>And yes, of course, in so doing I mention WHY I find interesting the idea of pursuing old values through new methods.<br/>Of course I say that the old games had a primitive design. Because that is true, a fact, the first ever made rpg has to have a less mature, less aware, less polished design than whatever came later.<br/>Is this an insult to that game? No. It's a critical description.<br/>It doesn't mean that the game is crap. Or has no value.<br/><br/>Somehow in a den of traditionalists and grognards this came through clearly enough that a fruitful conversation could be held.<br/>Somehow in a progressive, open minded, inclusive, safe community such as SG ... this lead to madness. I mean, some of our community wrote that they were barely able to contain their rage in front of the article I wrote.<br/><br/>Man, who cares about my article anymore!<br/>This incident worries me. Probably because it is closer to "my reality" than whatever other people can say about the world as a general and vague concept.<br/><br/>Tone policing, sure... we should all be nicer to each other. But there is a bigger problem here that I don't think can be solved just like this.<br/>And I don't know... CAN we do something to help the situation at least in this small piece of world that is SG?<br/>Do we even WANT to try and face/address this problem?<br/>I would like to, but I'm not in for a useless solo-crusade that nobody else feels matters.<br/><br/>I don't know.

Thus I am not surprised that the reaction over there was nicer to something diminutive towards OSR design.\n<blockquote>"OSR design is stuck in the past ... and it's a pity"<br/>It sure is a strong statement.<br/>But... asserting that OSR design is not moving past its original roots should at most have people say "dah-ha it's what OSR is all about, what did you expect? Dummy!" which is by far and large what happened on RPGnet.</blockquote>\nThere are likely people who aren't convinced that OSR design is stuck in the past.<br/>Who won't compliment and reaffirm you for making the statement.<br/><br/>Thus if you pose the statement to a group of people, who do value OSR design, as a valid, contemporary design philosophy, you can't reasonably expect that they just confirm your negative statement towards OSR design.<br/>That's like stating "Story Games diminish player agency and force them under Genre tropes" and expecting that most people would react along the lines of "Yeah, your right buddy". Even when posted in an OSR community, some people might be like "Man, that's on the one hand wrong, and on the other hand harsh".<br/> <br/>Specially considering that your article doesn't stop the negative statements in regards of OSR design with the headline. Which in the end devalues the OSR design and suggest that it should essentially be like story games.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer" title="Dreamer"><img alt="Dreamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer">Dreamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465437/#Comment_465437" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-10T11:30:57+00:00" title="August 10, 2017 11:30AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A couple of nitpicks:<br/><br/>1.

He happened to choose a topic and position that are not only wrong, but so wrong that they cannot even be discussed.<br/><br/>As an added cherry on top, it is apparently needful to seek justification for this treatment in the substantial details of what Hasimir wrote, as if to say that he failed by writing badly. It is not us, this justification says - not us who shut him down. It is him, for he expressed himself wrong. All the fault can be found in him, for we are of course patient and understanding people, open to ideas and ever friendly to intelligent discourse.<br/><br/>This is all very understandable if one takes a cynical view on the nature of Internet discussion: what are we but apes shouting 'yea' or 'nay' in affirmation of tribal politics, amassing social capital? I believe that much of the "thin-skinnedness" present in modern Internet culture is about primal social instincts going on over-drive in the simplified virtual world. Humans are basically hard-wired to seek social capital (it makes us safe and happy), and the main ways you get that is by fawning on the elites and oppressing the outsiders. (The third method would be impressing others with the cut of your jib, but who's got the jib for that...) This means that anybody who makes themselves an "easy target" by saying something that others can confidently predict to be contrary to group-think will be attacked instinctively. The attack doesn't cost you social capital because the target is easy, and you reap the satisfaction of getting to act as part of the group in stoning the infidel. The group will obviously excuse the attack, for it was made in righteous anger, motivated by the desire to belong to the group and fight for it.<br/><br/>Hasimir's case is a difficult one for case study, though, as truthfully it seems that James as the moderator was the one who escalated the discussion from the usual sort of debate to a matter of transgression. For better or worse, this wasn't quite your standard Internet witch hunt [grin].                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465440/#Comment_465440" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-10T12:35:23+00:00" title="August 10, 2017 12:35PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My two cents, Alessandro:<br/><br/>OSR design is intentionally staying with its roots.  The past is present in OSR design, but it isn't "stuck", and there's absolutely nothing about it to "pity".<br/><br/>You chose an antagonistic phrasing.  For what reason I don't know, but the usual reason to do that online is to get attention and response.  Unfortunately the usual consequence of that is antagonistic response.  People yelling hate at each other and no one listening.<br/><br/>I like that Story Games is not the place for that.  There is no shortage of other options.<br/><br/>Context and history is also 99% of the battle.  In the wider world, the insults that get policed and the ones that don't are determined solely by how they've been used in the past.  Someone identifying with "story gamers" in some way ripping on the OSR?  That's been used to make the hobby a less fun place to be.  It's bad for the culture.  You want to adorn a forum with OSR-bashing thread titles, pick a forum that isn't associated with a group/culture/whatever that some people think is the OSR's enemy.<br/><br/>I'm not claiming this is a big deal.  This is about hobby design, not the serious issues that thin skin and reactionary nonsense are deforming in the broader culture.  But I also don't think it's a big deal that some people here didn't like your thread and James closed it.<br/><br/>If you want thicker skin, may I suggest leading by example and not describing the negative response you received here in melodramatic terms?<br/><br/>I think the larger phenomenon that you find troubling is very real.  It troubles me too.

However my reaction to it was pretty short, largely because he is making the same argument we've seen again and again from people who don't get the OSR and come at it from a more story game perspective. To me it is just obviously missing the point and it is obvious he is speaking a whole different language. If he wants to critique it, he should play some of these games on their own terms and play more of these games. There are just assumptions in there that an OSR person is not going to even care about. The whole fascination with advancing the art of design for its own sake is not something you tend to encounter in the OSR. That isn't to say people dislike innovation or streamlining. But they want a good reason for an innovation, and there is a focus on not throwing the baby out with the back water (and this latter bit is part of the attraction to going back to the older games and gaining insight from them). There are much better people than me out there to be making this point. I have an interest in OSR, I take inspiration from it in my approach, and I have had a wonderful experience going back and drawing on books like the 1E DMG. I believe it was around 2005 or so that I decided to go back to the basics and see if my knowledge of the past matched the content of the books. I quickly discovered I had misremembered a lot of things, and thrown away a lot of useful gems in the process. Around 2009 or 2010, my business partner showed me a boxed set of Lamentations of the Flame Princess and that really opened my eyes to things. If you are focusing on the mechanics being too similar to D&amp;D then you are focusing on entirely the wrong aspect of the books. My advice with that one is to check out the GM advice, check the modules and with any OSR try to find the tweaks they do make to the core mechanics. All I know is reading the LotFP books and some of the other OSR stuff, as well as the various OSR blogs, greatly enhanced play at my own table (in a way that no amount of mechanical innovation would have). Some games do try to tweak and change things toward a particular goal, others are more about going back to the basics and making it easier to play the older games. There is nothing wrong with taking a critical lens to things, but if you only take a critical lens to the OSR and to older games, and you don't first engage them on their own terms and embrace what they are about, your criticism is not going to resonate with the OSR crowd. Hasimir's article just seemed like textbook not getting the point of the OSR.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465449/#Comment_465449" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-10T15:11:25+00:00" title="August 10, 2017  3:11PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 10, 2017 3:36PM by WarriorMonk.">edited August 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>I wonder to what extent this "problem" has come into being because of new ways of communicating.<br/><br/>For example, it's easy to start to think that "in the past, you could say anything you wanted!

You see, we police ourselves better<b> when we can see or have more info about the people we are talking to, but now we don't.</b> Now it's like each of us is coming up to the stage under a light that doesn't let us see the faces of the crowd, not even know if there's an actual crowd there.<br/><br/>So we go up, speak our minds totally unpoliced (or policed for the wrong audience) and then we wonder why everybody is getting offended! Perhaps the thing would get better the day the same algorithms and engines that are used to get information on consumers and to show them things they would like to buy gets used to show them things they would like to hear and people they would like to meet; but otherwise we're stuck with the current situation... which OTOH is probably for the best.<br/><br/>I mean, right now as world citizens it's like we're finally knowing each other, realizing how good and bad we really are, getting to know a bit of each other's culture, how people from the other side of the globe thinks and sees things.

Once you get really steeped in the OSR defaults, you begin to see just how important the "little tweaks" in various designs are.  For example, Secret Fire has a fresh take on alignment, Adventurer Conqueror King has a fresh take on estate management, and these both incline sandboxy play toward pretty different destinations than games that don't highlight such features.  <br/><br/>The OSR also puts out products and creations that aren't full games but can make a big difference to how your table plays D&amp;D, like Courtney Campbell's "On the Non-Player Character".  My friend's Goblin Uprising campaign is the most lethal, impartial, challenge-based mega-crawl I've ever heard of -- total OSR ethos -- and they played it using the Pathfinder rules.  The bulk of the formal ruleset can be, y'know, important, but not <i>the</i> biggest part of the equation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465524/#Comment_465524" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-12T00:30:40+00:00" title="August 12, 2017 12:30AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I also agree that <a href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan%27s">@Bedrockbrendan's</a> post was excellent.

His complaint about the OSR being frustratingly conservative creatively isn't even anything new, I see similar sentiments all the time from people who see <i>something</i> exciting in the OSR but still find some particular aspect to criticize. His blog post was clear, polite and to the point, too. Demanding more of it practically goes into a territory where we'd need an imprimatur system of some sort to pre-check blog posts for politically undesirable content.<br/><br/>This of course has nothing to do with the moderation of this site - I am not a moderator. If the moderation wishes to find against even the whiff of potential controversy, that's on them. (I mean this sincerely, it's really up to James to decide what goes on in his forum.) Doesn't mean that anybody else needs to condemn Hasimir for some spurious etiquette crime, except perhaps if you feel the need to express to James how very much on board you are with his moderation choices, and find complaining about Hasimir to be the appropriate way to do that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt

but I don't find this an incorrect generalisation.<br/>In this thread I'm specifically talking about each and every SG user who posted in my old thread expressing hurt and offence and anger caused by my article.<br/>Which prompted me to also consider a relevant amount of other people I have firsthand read online (here and in other venues) behaving in the same way in similar situations.<br/><br/>Yes, the phenomenon at large is a general concept.<br/>But this thread starts because I've seen it happen here, now, involving you and you and you.<br/><br/>PS: who is "us" supposed to be?<br/><br/>Why don't you explain to me your side of the story? Your point of view?<br/>I opened this discussion to better understand the people of this community and to face this phenomenon I see happening here (among other places).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yochaigal" title="yochaigal"><img alt="yochaigal" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/885/nLZYCQ6WJ20JO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yochaigal">yochaigal</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466704/#Comment_466704" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-30T12:48:18+00:00" title="September 30, 2017 12:48PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The original thread had a lot of OSR is THIS or OSR isn't THIS sort of talk.
