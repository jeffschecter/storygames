We were just learning the mechanics, so the scenario was a pretty simple "stop the envy boggins from possessing the car-nut teenagers".<br/><br/>We had a lot of fun with the game.  People started using advantage dice and style points soon after we started, and we had fun affecting changes in the dream world.  During the dream sequence one really lazy cat caused his paw to stretch out like Dhalsim from Street Fighter so he could swat down a flying boggin without pouncing, and my tomcat forced a car to swerve and crush another one.<br/><br/>There was some ambiguity in the magic section - are we making a roll every time we use cat magic?  If so, what are the difficulties - we weren't sure if it was Good/Strong/Best = 3/4/5 or Good/Strong/Best = 1/2/3 <br/><br/>Anyway, the GM wants to see some actual play threads to get some scenario inspiration, and I promised to hunt some down for her.  So far Googling hasn't helped...If anyone has links to Cat AP threads I'd appreciate if you posted them here ^-^<br/><br/>(We don't have an AP report, but we did set up a <a href="http://shadowcabinet.org/wiki/index.php/Cat" rel="nofollow">page on our wiki</a>)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon" title="Vaxalon"><img alt="Vaxalon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/42393690/1509967"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon">Vaxalon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68932/#Comment_68932" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-14T10:15:32+00:00" title="May 14, 2007 10:15AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played it with my kids a while back but I didn't post an AP thread at the time, and I don't remember enough about it to answer your questions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68968">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68968/#Comment_68968" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-14T11:55:31+00:00" title="May 14, 2007 11:55AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran Cat for some total non-gamer friends a few months back and posted an AP <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=23479.0" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  We had a lot of fun and they really took to the game after some initial hesitation.  Since it was a one-shot, the scenario was very simple.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
