First time poster here. I thought this might be a good place to share my collaborative poetry game, which I've released in honor of Hobbit Day.<br/><br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw3u7valLoIWUHI5bzUyYkhvZnM/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw3u7valLoIWUHI5bzUyYkhvZnM/view?usp=sharing</a><br/><br/>It is about writing more poems about one of my favorite Tolkien characters, Tom Bombadil. I didn't playtest it terribly much (since it's such a small little game), but I've had a lot of fun with it - even solo!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
