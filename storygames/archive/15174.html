You could go all <a href="http://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/2007/12/07/stoke-birmingham-0-0" rel="nofollow">Stoke City 0-0 Birmingham</a>, where the point is to express and experience boredom. But then you could specify any emtional state to which either or both players could steer their characters, bringing in or making up elements of the lives outside their watery prison. <br/><br/>Another thought, the more outside elements you bring in, the less the bathysphere is going to feel like a prison, unless you use these elements in juxtaposition to the claustrophobia of the current situation.<br/><br/>You could increase powerlessness by having some outside situation occur about which the characters get brief updates on the phone but aren't able to intervene. Nuclear war or some other apocalypse would provide a decent backdrop against which one might play out a confessional game. The tension could be created by having to share the worst thing you ever did without the other player's character feeling sorry for you, or being revolted, or perhaps worse, excited. The apocalypse is a sledgehammer so it could be something more mundane such a relative dying of old age, waiting on exam results or a job interview (who gets tenure?).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344889/#Comment_344889" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-05T05:41:45+00:00" title="October  5, 2011  5:41AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite>In Grace Under Pressure (Unspeakable Oath #2), you get a cardboard cut-out submarine with which to impress the players, but that probably not what you're after.</blockquote>\nAlong with some advice on setting up a cramped "set" in a narrow hallway with sonar sounds and chairs with very little lighting to represent the feel of being stuck in a 4 person shuttle type sub, IIRC.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344891/#Comment_344891" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-05T06:08:39+00:00" title="October  5, 2011  6:08AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Play the game in an elevator.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344898">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344898/#Comment_344898" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-05T08:08:53+00:00" title="October  5, 2011  8:08AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Consult movies set in confined, single locations for useful techniques!

"He keeps sneezing on my arm" or "his breathing is really whiny."  Tremendously mundane things that only become an issue when you're stuck in a cramped space with another dude for hours on end.  Then a system that rewards them escalating their petty conflicts into something more extreme.  These minor, internal conflicts would be counterpoint to any other conflicts or goals the occupants have, and might come in conflict with completing their mission.<br/><br/><br/>Also, two characters is not the same as two players.  Each character might be played by multiple people, who represent different facets or desires or emotions of the occupants.  Or additional players could play the bathysphere or the ocean or whatever, putting in details of confinement and darkness and fear.  Perhaps both occupants both loved the same woman who died mysteriously, and her ghost haunts them both (literally or metaphorically).<br/><br/><br/>Provide a limited set of specific tools, with strict limitations on how they can affect the outside environment.  You have a light that shines X amount of brightness, for up to Y hours of battery.  And a single claw that can grasp some objects.  Two or three scientific testing tools.  And that's it.  How do you resolve any external conflict using this limited set of resources?  How do you decide which of you runs the claw and which mans the sonar?  What happens when the depth gauge stops working?<br/><br/>A continuously escalating chance of danger of the bathysphere bursting as it dives.  Below a certain depth, you keep rolling more and more dice until one hits the target number (or steal Dread's Jenga tower, which gives its own escalating tension).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344903/#Comment_344903" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-05T11:02:14+00:00" title="October  5, 2011 11:02AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            These are great ideas!

Maybe a snowed in haunted house or an undersea research laboratory. Label the important parts of the enclosure, these become the aspects of the characters. <br/><br/>Take your bathysphere, it might have 1) portholes and light controls, 2) telephone station, 3) external sensors station, and 4) life support station. These four places become the four "attributes" of each character. One character may be a marine biologist, aligned with the portholes, the deep sea diver might care more about the life support. Each of these has their own less concrete associations, the telephone intensive character will likely be a good talker, even if the phone has stopped working.<br/><br/>The distribution of affinity to the different places translates to pools of points for the GM to build threats and trouble related (but not necessarily confined to) to each place. In an action movie version of the game players name the threats they want for each affinity they have highest, leaving the specific details to the GM. For a more suspenseful variant, the GM can determine the threats secretly, and then hint and misdirect about them as the action proceeds. <br/><br/>For resolution, I think however you go about it: 1) complications and discoveries should arise, 2) one of the threats will ultimately become the dominant threat, perhaps by gaining some of the pool of defeated threats as the action proceeds. <br/><br/>The overall goal is to reinforce the enclosure, mechanically and thematically.<br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_344905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344905/#Comment_344905" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-05T11:31:31+00:00" title="October  5, 2011 11:31AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mr. Teapot</cite>To communicate claustrophobia, I'd want each occupant to have some really minor, petty complaints about the other occupant.

Maybe they know some *wonderful* secrets (joyous, exciting, can set you free), but cannot speak them because of some outside pressure.

Rough idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeck of cards. Two players.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeal 8 cards to each player. They sort their own stacks and put all of the red cards on top of their own stacks. Black cards are on the bottom. This becomes each player's "wits" stack.  Flip over the top card and place on each stack. If the card on top of the stack is red, then the players still "have their wits". At some point, with enough cards being pulled off the stack, a black card will make the player become "erratic." Discarding the stack dry mean "dead".<br/>\n<br/>\nBasic scene structure:<br/>\nA scene starts with "determine immediate threat". This could be based off of a random table, based on a previous scene, whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nEach player gets dealt three cards, and each player will play one card into one of three "resolution" stacks facedown. There is an "immediate threat" stack, a "long term threat" stack, and a "relationship" stack. once both players play a single card into each stack, each stack should have 2 cards face down. Oh, and by the way, if a player is "erratic," he only gets two cards to place. The third stack is filled up with a random draw from the deck.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, two cards are dealt facedown. This becomes the "threat threshold."<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, player play out the scene dealing with the immediate threat, alternating by turning cards over between the immediate threat stack and the threat threshold. If the sum total of the immediate threat stack is greater than the sum total of the threat threshold, then that's a good outcome for the players, otherwise, it's bad.<br/>\n<br/>\n"I'm going over to check on the air pressure gauge" (turns over the the top immediate threat card, gets 7)<br/>\n"What does it say?" (turns over the top threat threshold card, it's a 9, our heroes are losing!)<br/>\n"I tap on the air meter...it doesn't seem to be working. Get over here quick!" (turns over the next immediate threat, gets a K, for 17)<br/>\n"trying turning this release value." (turns over the other threat threshold card, for a 2...sum total of 11, 17 beats 11, so our heroes win!)<br/>\n"PSSSSS..the air meter fills up, showing acceptable levels"<br/>\n<br/>\nNext, the long term stack is flipped, if the some total of this stack can't beat the threshold, then a new long-term threat is introduced, which may or may not be created as a result of the immediate outcome.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, the relationship stack is flipped, if the sum total of this stack can't beat the threshold, then the relationship becomes (further) strained, as a result of immediate resolution, or the long-term threat, or just that both players are being annoyed with each other due to the circumstances.<br/>\n<br/>\nA player may make a "heroic effort" to increase a value of one of the three stacks so it can beat the threshold, by discarding and adding the value of the top card from his "wits" deck.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor every stack that does not beat the threat threshold, shuffle back into the deck a discarded card.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny player that can survive long enough to clear out the deck is rescued, and wins the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_346302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346302/#Comment_346302" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-17T11:23:48+00:00" title="October 17, 2011 11:23AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 17, 2011 11:24AM by ccreitz.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>How do you structure it?</blockquote> Require reincorporation of one of a small number of elements in each scene?
