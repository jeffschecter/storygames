I really dig. It's even fun to read.<br/><br/>Some thoughts:<br/><br/>* The moves are sometimes a little too forgiving for my tastes. I'd prefer to see a "choose 1" on a 7-9, and "choose 2" on a 10+ for some of those. But that's an easy modification to make, if I want to do that.<br/><br/>* What is the Monkey Gate? Is it just a name, or is there some meaning to it? I had the most trouble imagining this one.<br/><br/>* The main thing that I often need from a module is not the sensory details (although yours are amazing) but a general sense of logic for the existence of the thing.<br/><br/>You hint at this in the Rumors section, but, beyond that, you ask the GM to come up with stuff on the fly and then hope it makes sense later.<br/><br/>So, for me, I would want to add something about the general state of thing; why is it here, why are WE here, and what's behind it?<br/><br/>Having a general sense of what the thing IS before starting would allow me to use this whole thing on-the-fly, without even reading it first. Otherwise, it's still possible, but more difficult.<br/><br/>Anyway, these are minor comments.

The Monkey Gate illustration really helps!<br/><br/>I suppose we may have opposite interests in terms of the module's use. When I use a module, I want to know the "why" behind it, so I can come up with a way to situate it in the setting, and then I have a method for answering questions.<br/><br/>For example, if I know the mansion was built in the forest to establish secrecy, I will know to describe its walls as tall and foreboding, rather than short and ornate. I can have a sense of the rumours about it, and so on.<br/><br/>To leave it wide open certainly gives the material flexibility, but, for me, makes it harder to improvise.<br/><br/>I never have trouble coming up with details. I do have trouble coming up with the rationale behind the whole thing, tying it all together. So I look for a good "hook" or simple backstory in a module (like Lady Blackbird's concept of an escape from an arranged marriage), which I can then use to improvise around.<br/><br/>Consider how Dogs in the Vineyard's premise (a group ride into a Town which harbours trouble, and are expected to fix it) allows everything else to hang off that premise and makes it easy to improvise details.<br/><br/>Your module is fantastic, but to use it, I would need to come up with that kind of thing first.<br/><br/>On the other hand, with a simple explanation for what is there and why, I feel like I could "run" this module completely on-the-fly, without even reading it through before playing!<br/><br/>Great stuff.<br/><br/>(I have experimented with methods for generating such things on the fly, and as simply as possible, as in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19417/the-silver-dragon-s-tear-fantasy-apocalypse-world-for-kids-or-quick-play" rel="nofollow">The Silver Dragon's Tear</a>.

It's like a hook made of hooks, perfect for an improvisational game like Dungeon World, but you might need to wear gloves while handling it. I like the idea and the next time I'm moved to run a session of Dungeon World I may well use this. Your lack of experience does not show.<br/><br/>As for what's useful in general? I could take this for most games and build on it, as I said, it's a hook made of hooks, which is enough for DW, but for any other game, you have to use it like it's a hook and create something based upon it. If this were advertised as anything other than a PbtA module, I wouldn't buy it. For other games which need more certainties, it wouldn't be as useful.<br/><br/>I'm currently working out the most efficient and intuitive way to build scenarios for my game and this has made me think. It's a game about information. This is pretty anathema to that. But I could see myself building it into a scenario that fit, as mentioned before.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444954/#Comment_444954" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-25T12:08:54+00:00" title="April 25, 2015 12:08PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This kind of stuff is quite exciting to me, and I think will be useful - even if I just shred the dungeon-as-such as use them as individual pieces.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444957/#Comment_444957" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-26T11:30:52+00:00" title="April 26, 2015 11:30AM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In fact, this might see some action tomorrow night in my West Marches -esque game.

A list of some options for Bleakwood House would be tremendously helpful, I feel.)<br/><br/>(The "rumours" section <i>almost</i> does this. Unfortunately, knowing that there have been some disappearances lately doesn't tell you whether a gang of bandits has taken over the Mansion, or whether the Lady is having a tea party - e.g. "sounds of conversation and music" in the Foyer.)<br/><br/>(My feeling on reading it is that it could be an abandoned mansion, complete with bizarre experiments gone wrong... or maybe it's a bandit's hideout! Or maybe a gentle but eccentric family lives there, a la Addams Family. It's hard to figure out which it actually is, though, as some of the details point to many different possibilities. Having chosen some theme to tie it all together, though, I feel like I could run a decent adventure/location on the fly, without even reading ahead, which would be pretty cool.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dirk" title="Dirk"><img alt="Dirk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dirk">Dirk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445310/#Comment_445310" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-23T05:29:02+00:00" title="May 23, 2015  5:29AM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran this in Dungeon World, which has been my pretty exclusive jam over the past few months.<br/><br/>The game went well. It was a short session. We spent about an hour playing out the first scene, interspersed with these questions (sometimes played out in flashback.) We had one PC from a previous adventure with the same play group (the fighter), one PC who had been an NPC in that same adventure (the warmage), and two new characters.<br/><br/>There was our Mage, pursued by a shadowy noble who fears the source of the Mage's power. Our Cleric was a friend and abettor of the Mage, giving hospitality in the temple when the noble's mercenaries arrived. Our Fighter was a childhood friend of the Mage, and present as well for the mercenaries' arrival. Lastly, our Warmage was one of the dispatched mercenaries, but abandoned his mission when he saw the fighter (she had saved his life in a previous adventure.)<br/><br/>This was all established by asking the mage, "what sent you fleeing..." and then pushing for details based on the answer ("how did that happen?" "what were you doing there?" "how did the two of you end up together that night?")<br/><br/>The mage also got the "What priceless thing..." question, and, choosing the liability of a will to escape. It was described a headless black worm, found in the depths of the cleric's temple. Followed up with some detail prodding, "why are you so sure this thing is important?" (clue to the source of magic?) "does the cleric know you've looted this artifact?" (no))<br/><br/>For "who offers safe haven...", "who pursues you...", I just directly asked them to pick a name from their sheets for these people, to save the agony of decision-making, then asked for a couple tags to describe the reputation of those newly-named characters.<br/> <br/>We left the identity and specific agenda of the shadowy noble un-detailed, which suits me fine; a little left unsaid makes the world seem bigger somehow.<br/><br/>In the end, the ship sank, and the party and handful of sailors weathered the storm on a rocky outcropping.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445312">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445312/#Comment_445312" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-23T16:17:49+00:00" title="May 23, 2015  4:17PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds great.

Did you play out the flashbacks as actual scenes, or just narrate/brainstorm their details?<br/><br/>As for "it's small and easily lost", that's my least favourite option on your list. I would probably replace it with something like, "It's easily recognizable by anyone laying eyes on it". This also implies there might be people looking for it or offering money for it, which could cause trouble for the character in a way similar to how "a will to escape" and "large and heavy" might.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dirk" title="Dirk"><img alt="Dirk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dirk">Dirk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445315/#Comment_445315" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-23T19:28:01+00:00" title="May 23, 2015  7:28PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, that's an awesome suggestion, Paul. That substitution is definitely more interesting.<br/><br/>During the shipwreck scene, the fighter was first to rush abovedecks, although dizzy and hampered by seasickness. The ship had become lodged on a jut of rock and she raced to help a group of sailors dislodge it with poles. In the attempt, she slipped overboard.<br/><br/>The cleric threw her a rope, but was himself dragged in. Now the two of them were being tossed around rather roughly in the water, on opposite ends of a long rope. The Warmage used a spell to snap the slack middle of the rope to his hand and then charmed one of the sailors to pull them in.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Mage came above and wove a spell to make the two in the water more bouyant. A 7-9 result on the casting, so the effect worked in an unexpected way and drew some attention. The flailing swimmers witnessed the fat under their skin swell, and their hair become denser and more oily until they resembled something like sea lions. They soon had sharks circling beneath them.<br/><br/>The cleric, investigating the dark shapes in the water below, cast a light spell on his holy symbol, illuminating a shark closing in on him. He quickly wove a spell to cause fear in the animal, who reared back with a shudder, striking the cleric's holy symbol to the depths before retreating.<br/><br/>By this time, the ship was half-submerged, prow up. Those of the crew who hadn't fallen overboard were evacuating onto the jutting rocks. The cleric and fighter were pulled safely to the rocks as well. They managed to rescue the dinghy, and used it to shelter themselves while the storm passed. In the morning, they ferried themselves to shore, a few hundred miles north of their destination.<br/><br/>Also, RE: Perilous Journeys: I haven't read it, thanks for the recommendation!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jakob" title="Jakob"><img alt="Jakob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jakob">Jakob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445517/#Comment_445517" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-04T19:50:29+00:00" title="June  4, 2015  7:50PM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like this a lot.

Or maybe it's in two phases: one in which players create the details, and another in which they resolve them by creating backstory, etc. There might be some constraints of time and place necessary during detail creation, but no more than are present in Microscope, for instance. Could be fun. Or maybe there's something like this already out there?<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Dirk">@Dirk</a> I love your art. And your questions / set-ups.
