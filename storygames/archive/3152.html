Everyone was. There is no surface world, just caverns and dungeons, as far up or down as you want to go. Some of the caverns are a mile or two in diameter, and some of those have tiny fake suns and moons hanging in the "sky", but everyone knows if you have a flying carpet or if you're just a dedicated climber, you can reach up and touch the sky. Some caverns are always lit with "daylight" or "moonlight", while in others, the sun turns into a moon after twelve hours, then turns back in another twelve hours. Some caverns are pitch black. Some glow softly, in various colors. Plants can grow in the caverns; no one worries about how, anymore than they worry how dragons can fly, or how rain forms, or why waterfalls mostly fall downwards. It's just magic.</p>\n<p>Rules: same as standard octaNe, but with the new Might and Magic metastyle rules (M&amp;M reduce hazards without the need to spend a plot point.) You can have both Might and Magic styles if your role has them both. You also have two additional details: Level and Alignment. Characters start out as Level 1, and so do most of the menaces you face. If your Level is higher than the opponent's Level, you reduce any hazard rating; if the opponent's Level is higher, there's an extra hazard. Use the difference between the levels to adjust the hazard rating up or down. You can spend a plot point at the end of an extended conflict (roughly, every three scenes.)</p>\n<p>Alignment: there's only two, Law and Chaos. You can be unaligned, and many people and things are. However, magical items are often aligned and can detect the alignment of those who chose to use them. They will withhold their powers from users of the opposite alignment or if their user is acting <em>against</em> their alignment (unaligned actions don't count.) Some spells affect specific alignments. Powerful supernatural beings tend to be aligned, too.</p>\n<p>Law and Chaos are not good and evil. Law is all about order imposed from above and obedience responding from below. Chaos is about personal ethics, desire, creativity, and individualism. All the gods are aligned with Law, all the demons are aligned with Chaos, but there are a lot of other factions of Law and Chaos that don't necessarily get along with those two.</p>\n<p>Roles: creating roles follows the rules in the book, with one exception: the "informative" part of the role's name comes from a class template stolen -- err, borrowed -- from D&amp;D. There are four basic class templates and several hybrids.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Warriors have the Might style. They are dedicated to physically attacking problems, or threatening to. Warrior roles can use other descriptive war-like names, like "Archer", "Gladiator", or "Cavalier".</li>\n<li>Priests have the Magic style. They are always aligned with Law (because what priests do is impose the will of the gods on the people.) Other synonyms for priest-like roles include "Acolyte", "Bishop", "Vicar", and "Friar".</li>\n<li>Wizards have the Magic style. They are always aligned with Chaos (because, good or evil or indifferent, they are concerned with self-development and expression of their power.) Other synonyms for wizard-like roles include "Sorcerer", "Witch", "Enchanter", and "Magician".</li>\n<li>Rogues aren't limited by style, but they are dedicated to physical or social solutions that don't involve direct attack. This includes thieves, but also assassins (if you mean someone who kills by poisons and traps,) conmen, scouts, and basically anyone who isn't primarily a warrior, priest or wizard.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hybrid class templates are combos of two primary class templates with a restrictive phrase, like Paladin (fanatic Warrior-Priest,) Monk (ascetic Warrior-Priest,) or Bard (musical Rogue-Wizard.) Always include the restrictive phrase and hyphenated primary class templates in parentheses, to let other players know what you're aiming for.</p>\n<p>To make your role, pick a primary or hybrid class template and combine it with an evocative phrase that makes the role unique, like "Apostate Priest", "World-Weary Wizard", "Megalomaniacal Necromancer", "Rumor-Mongering Bard". Make sure the role has at least two suggested styles and one skill for each of the four primary styles, plus Might and Magic skills, if necessary. Two players can both play the same class, but not the same role.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/talysman" title="talysman"><img alt="talysman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/talysman">talysman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71949/#Comment_71949" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-25T22:46:18+00:00" title="May 25, 2007 10:46PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Hmm, I left out some stuff.</p>\n<p>The caverns are connected by what are called "vad tunnels". These are created by "vad worms" -- purple worms, basically, that tunnel through rock, break into a cavern, travel a few yards, then burrow into another tunnel. They occasionally crush or swallow anything that's in their way and defend themselves if attacked, but they don't seem to hunt anything for prey. They're just a mystery.</p>\n<p>Tunnels are never brightly lit. They may be pitch black, lit by a soft glow, or have patches of brighter moss. They may be dry, have a stream/river, or be completely filled with water or other liquids.</p>\n<p>Tunnels are occasionally used for commerce or invasion. Oftentimes, creatures of various kinds carve out lairs that branch off from the tunnels, to try to control trade routes or set up defenses. creatures in caverns dig lairs or dungeons, too.</p>\n<p>Fantasy races are included in your role, just like in OD&amp;D. Elves are woodland Warrior-Wizard or Rogue-Wizard hybrids, for example, and you can choose to be an Arrogant Elven Lord, a Taciturn Elven Bowman, or Duplicitous Elven Thief.</p>\n<p>I may come back later with some Stompin' Grounds appropriate for this setting.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.
