Thanks to everyone that helped out with suggestions. I have the map and will try and get pictures as soon as I can get my broken camera working. Also, will attempt a write-up as soon as I can get my broken brain working.<br/><br/>We ended up with "Collider", a B-movie with an A-budget, about an outbreak of nanotech zombies in the empty shell of the Large Hadron Collider in 2035. Personal highlight: my sleazy project administrator ended up exploding when he got thrown into some high tech machinery clutching the case of C4 he had mistaken for his briefcase, which entertained me no end (and spoiled a few zombies days). There were a few places where it looked like the survivors would have it easy, and maybe even most of them would survive, and then it swung the other way with the menace looking like it would take everyone out, but we ended up with 2 survivors getting their goals at the same time while getting out of the complex, and dropping the menace to nearly nothing. We then left the fate of the last survivor up to a final dice-off with the remnants of the menace.<br/><br/>A few notes (bearing in mind that I haven't read the rules since playing and didn't get much chance to look at them while playing due to having too much fun, so I may have missed some things):\n<ul>\n<li>We ended up with the 2 insertion team operatives dying first, and together, due to the fact that they ended up rolling badly and losing every conflict with the menace, and not getting as far as a chance to split up when their opposing goals became relevant. Some way of stopping characters which appear together dying together if they don't get around to splitting up might be useful, maybe sacrificing one characters survival dice to give the other a chance to carry on?<br/></li><li>The 2 <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">ninjas</span> operatives mentioned above also saw the worst of the menace as they headed straight for where the areas where the menace was whereas some other characters were all the way at the other end of the complex and didn't see the menace 'till they spread further. I think this was my fault for forgetting what I'd realised thinking about movies like Jurassic Park, where the environment and other factors (in this case the increasingly messed up security lockdown) should also be considered to be part of the menace (not just, 'there's zombies', but 'you're trapped in here, everything's malfunctioning, <i>and </i>there's zombies') and cause conflicts.<br/></li><li>We had some issues with pacing, specifically in that when the operatives died just after the menace reached 8 dice, some people thought this was too early (8 dice means the menace is fully revealed) and some people were worried that no-one had died before that (8 dice means that the menace is at it's most threatening and has probably already taken out some of the main characters). This will probably be better in further games with this group now we've seen the pacing in action, but seems like it could be a common first-game issue.<br/></li><li>One of the players noted that there is still a penalty for dying, separate from losing your 'character' which most people weren't that bothered about, in that you will be heavily involved in less scenes. While you will still be directing scenes and making suggestions during other peoples, everyone with alive survivors will have that <i>and</i> playing their survivors in the scenes they appear in.<br/></li><li>Another player noted the large amount of cross-table talk, with people interjecting suggestions and then having several separate discussions about those suggestions while the director was trying to move the scene on. It didn't cause too many problems but we may need to look at putting something in place to deal with that, especially if we have more limited time than we had available for this session.<br/></li><li>Finally, I found myself holding off on using resource dice I had picked up due to the moments not being dramatic enough. This was just before the menace really started hammering us and I was feeling guilty about possibly spoiling the game by playing to the story rather than the mechanic. Should I have used the dice in earlier scenes or was holding them like that an approved action?</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173969/#Comment_173969" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T16:55:19+00:00" title="October  7, 2008  4:55PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 7, 2008 4:56PM by Ben_Robbins.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What rule set did you wind up using?

They'd still take a condition from losing but wouldn't be taken out. Of course, this would need to be limited to once per person, at least, and maybe once per game or some other condition to stop it happening all the time.\n<blockquote>It's true: if you get framed into scenes with the menace more than anyone else, you die first.<br/><br/>That's one mistake I've seen in multiple Geiger Counter games: getting too focused on particular characters early and putting them in harm's way without realizing it will doom them.

We'll know to discuss it (or at least know it's an area to watch out for) next time.\n<blockquote>Did you use the version 1 method of making non-survivors as well? We let players with dead survivors take over those roles, or (sometimes) promote a non-survivor if it fits the story.</blockquote>\nAs mentioned above, we created more characters than needed, but the problem was that we didn't really pay enough attention to them when we started playing, so they ended up either getting killed off early on or forgotten about. For example, there were a bunch of generic scientists hanging around in the labs, but most of them got killed off as a way of separating some survivors from the current director's survivor.\n<blockquote>That sounds like everyone was just excited about the game. But yeah, it can take relearning some discipline if you haven't played as many rotating authority games.</blockquote>\nMain issue there was the several points where the director couldn't make himself heard, so there needs to be at least some pretence of paying attention next time.

I've been trying to read raven games and start a podcast and write an article.<br/><br/>Andrew, you've totally enlightened me in that the text needs to actually talk carefully about pacing instead of just saying, like, "you should make sure you pace the game right."  Since the details of who dies and when they die is often in the players' collective hands (in how they frame scenes and whether they pool dice), making sure that people have a sense of how to pace a successful game is really important.  Most groups I know figure this out through a mixture of familiarity with survival horror tropes and just playing the game several times.  But I could definitely make that easier.<br/><br/>One thing I think you might be doing different than me: when I run Geiger, you can't pick up dice until you define them and you can't define them until you're about to roll them in a confrontation.  So my characters don't walk around with a bunch of undefined dice.  I fully support heresies in which you can define and pick up dice before you use them (since I do that on occasion, depending on circumstances), but picking up undefined dice sounds like a slippery road to me.<br/><br/>Also, one other suggestion: the reason that the menace doesn't have tokens to represent them on the map is that they are presumed to be anywhere they need to be or, in the case of horde-style menaces, potentially in every location on the map.  It sounds like, in your game, you created this understanding that the menace was located in a particular area, which I think may be dangerous. Creating places that are understood to be "safe" should always be temporary, lasting for a couple scenes at most before the menace breaks in.<br/><br/>Hope that helps.  Also, I agree with anything Ben says about Geiger Counter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mortality" title="Mortality"><img alt="Mortality" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mortality">Mortality</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175068/#Comment_175068" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-15T08:35:56+00:00" title="October 15, 2008  8:35AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Jonathan, and don't worry about not scanning the boards every second for a Geiger Counter thread, I still haven't got around to doing a write-up and it's nearly 2 weeks later. I have (low quality) pictures of the map now, if I can remember how to access my web space.<br/><br/>In response to your suggestions:<br/>With pacing, yes suggestions would be useful, though I have no idea what I'd suggest myself. With the experience of this game I think we'd do better on the next one, but I'm not sure we'd be able to explain exactly <i>why</i>. If I think of anything I'll be sure and let you know.<br/>The action dice in question was <i>semi</i>-defined (it was a briefcase full of cool ninja weaponry and explosives) but the character wasn't aware what it was and probably wouldn't have known how to use it. I think in future I need to define them as something the character would use regularly, as opposed to what seems coolest.<br/>The location of the menace was, I think, a combination of setup and pacing mistakes. The setup was that the menace was confined in the one area which it broke out of at the start, and we then had scenes taking place simultaneously and with very brief intervals so not a lot of time passed per scene, meaning that the menace could not logically spread out. I think including environmental obstacles as part of the menace (as I mentioned), and giving more time for localised menaces to spread out by having longer scenes and 'spaces' between scenes, or having some way for them to spread more quickly would both help.<br/><br/>Just to reiterate, we all loved the game. Even my girlfriend, who hates the idea of narrating and was tempted to duck out when the game was explained. With any luck we'll play again soon and I'll have even more comments to make...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175244/#Comment_175244" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-16T19:53:05+00:00" title="October 16, 2008  7:53PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>Since the details of who dies and when they die is often in the players' collective hands (in how they frame scenes and whether they pool dice), making sure that people have a sense of how to pace a successful game is really important.</blockquote>\nOne rule of thumb I'd suggest would be to always frame characters who haven't been in a scene before people who have. Keep the focus moving around. So if Dr Connor was in a scene, he shouldn't be in a scene again until every other character has appeared (or are now in the scene with him).<br/><br/>There would be lots of exceptions of course, but this would be a good starting point for most scenarios.<br/>\n<blockquote>Also, I agree with anything Ben says about Geiger Counter.</blockquote>\nGeiger Counter is made of cheese!
