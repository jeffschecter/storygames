It's based on talking to Major Wesely back in GenCon 2005 and again in 2007. He's the the guy who ran it all of 40 years ago.<br/><br/>Have you ever heard of Braunstein? Most gamers haven't, which is pretty surprising since it was the first roleplaying game, the game that Dave Arneson played in that made him go off and run Blackmoor, which led to D&amp;D and the convoluted birth of the whole thing we're doing now.<br/><br/>I mention it here not just because it's a fascinating piece of gaming history, but because I think what happened in those games has a lot more in common with modern indie games than you might expect. It's kind of surprising: Dave Arneson was thinking outside the box before anyone had even invented the box. Major Wesely had no interest in fantasy escapism and probably would have been much more interested in Dogs in the Vineyard than he was in D&amp;D.<br/><br/>Either way, I think it's a surprising blindspot in our understanding of the roots of gaming and probably deserves more examination, so read on:<br/><br/><a href="http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/104/braunstein-the-roots-of-roleplaying-games/" rel="nofollow"><b>Braunstein: the Roots of Roleplaying Games</b></a><br/><br/>PS yeah, yeah, I meant to write this a long time ago, but it's pretty hard to tell someone else's story and do it justice                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_161071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161071/#Comment_161071" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-06T18:39:43+00:00" title="August  6, 2008  6:39PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great post, Ben.

It's particularly interesting because it also covers other games that made incremental, evolutionary steps towards inventing elements that are now standard in RPGs. There was a naval warfare game that had named ships and hit points, a dogfighting game with pilots that grew more skilled as they survived more missions, etc. It is odd that these things are seemingly always in obscure, out-of-print books.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_161111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161111/#Comment_161111" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-07T03:52:31+00:00" title="August  7, 2008  3:52AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neko -- I read a short description of Braunstein in some book years and years ago, which is why I recognized the name and went to the seminar in 2005.

A couple of additional anecdotes that I remember (very possibly inaccurately): <br/><br/>Maj Wesely said that at the time he was looking to find other local people in Wisconsin that were interested in playing war games, so he went to the library, checked out a book on military war gaming and then looked up in the phone book all the people who had checked out the book previously.  Lo and behold, one of those people was Dave Arneson.  See what you had to do before the interwebs?*<br/><br/>My other favorite anecdote is very, very sketchy, but has to do with Braunstein I and when the players got to play characters and realized they had freedoms they never had before. One of the guys was trying to get into the town of Braunstein, but he couldn't because the bridge into town over the river was guarded by enemy forces. Too bad. But... the guy then said, 'Hey, why can't I just swim across the river?'  which really threw Maj. Wesely for a loop<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> and he didn't know what to do because there wasn't exactly a swim rule.</span>**  Similar situation came up when two enemy characters wanted to fight a duel, and again, no rules for that.  Even though he tells these stories now with a sense of humor, it's pretty clear that at the time, his players drove him nuts with these crazy ideas.<br/><br/>The second Gencon, instead of Braunstein, we spent the afternoon chatting with him about the history of TSR and his friendship with Dave Arneson. It was an an outstanding time.<br/><br/>[edit]<br/><br/>Whoops, I have to clarify a couple of things:<br/><br/>* In case the kids today don't remember, back in the day, there was a card in the back of library books that had the names of everyone who had checked the book out.  You took the card, wrote your name on it and gave it to the librarian who stamped the due date in the book and the card.<br/><br/>** This is the more correct version (see, memory very sketchy) which was that when they were playing the game, they were all in a room yapping to each other, and at some point Maj. Wesely pointed out that they couldn't actually be talking because their characters weren't in the same place, in fact on the opposite sides of the river. Then the player said, 'Well, then I'll just swim across the river to talk to the guy."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_161349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161349/#Comment_161349" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-07T23:51:51+00:00" title="August  7, 2008 11:51PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Callan S.</cite>I think I can relate to Major Wesely.

It's also interesting that Arneson was playing one of the mechanically weakest characters -- all he had was leaflets, while other players had armies or secret police. I think he would have played his own way no matter what, but there's a broader point in there about limitations forcing you to improvise. Like you said, a bad player would whine about being powerless, a really good player would start playing outside the rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_161354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161354/#Comment_161354" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-08T01:08:06+00:00" title="August  8, 2008  1:08AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 8, 2008 3:26AM by Callan_S.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Robbins</cite>In the past they've been seriously underattended so we could just sit in the front and pick Major Wesely's brain.</blockquote>\nAnd damn, basically no one else knows about the treasure - it's just sitting there, waiting!<br/><br/>I would ask him...why did the swimming statement flummox him?
