I realized the game had many similarities with a never developed game idea I had called: Legacy.  For example, A Taste For Murder's Influence dice are very similar to an idea I had about tracking the "bonds" between family members.  I realized that A Taste For Murder very nearly gives me what I wanted out of Legacy.  With one small detail...<br/><br/>You see, I have a really bad habit of wanting to turn high color board and card games into RPGs.  In this case Legacy was inspired by the card game Gloom.  I really wanted a game about the tragic disintegration of a super creepy gothic family.  What A Taste For Murder is lacking is the Edward Gory/Tim Burton veneer.<br/><br/>So what I've done is worked out a way to use the Gloom deck in a game of A Taste For Murder.  It uses every type of card available in the game.  This is totally "working off the top of my head" and completely un-playtested but perhaps you will find it interesting.  These rules are organized by "type" of card in the Gloom card game and how they fit into A Taste For Murder.<br/><br/>Family Member Cards<br/><br/>I hope this one is obvious.  Pick a family.  Set aside the other families you won't be using them.  Everyone either chooses a family member to play or if you're feeling brave deal them out randomly.  Congratulations that's your character.<br/><br/>Option: Gloom characters don't seem to really live in a world with (effective) police.  Instead of Inspector Chapel arriving draw a card from a family that isn't the family being played.  This is the Outsider who somehow arrives and solves the case.<br/><br/>Modifiers (Positive)<br/><br/>You will need to separate out the positive modifier cards from the negative ones.  The positive modifiers are the cards you normally want to avoid getting in the Gloom game.  Shuffle the positive modifier cards and deal out one card per pair of players.  Use this card as the basis for the initial definition element of the relationship between your two characters.   Set aside the rest, you won't be using them for the rest of the game.<br/><br/>Events<br/><br/>Event cards replace the normal White Die/Black Die rules.  Shuffle the events together and deal two.  Place a white die on one and a black die on the other.  A player earns these dice by best incorporating these events into their side scenes.  After earning the die discard the current card.  The player then draws two cards from the event deck and chooses one to put the die back on top of.  If you run out of cards simply shuffle the discard pile and start cycling again.<br/><br/>Option: Events in Gloom are far more "meatier" than the simple emotions in A Taste For Murder.  Having two in play might make scenes too cluttered.  In which case use just one card with just a single bonus die available and let the players duke it out for best use of the event.<br/><br/>Untimely Death<br/><br/>When the murderer victim is chosen draw an Untimely Death card.  This is how the victim meets his demise (obviously in some manner that can be caused by another individual).<br/><br/>Modifiers (Negative)<br/><br/>Remember you've separated out the Positive and Negative Modifier cards and set aside any Positive cards not used during setup.  Whenever you are a successfully investigated draw a Negative Modifier card.  You must work this element into the next step (i.e. "And Secretly...", "And To Make It Worse...", or "And The Full Horror Is...") of your suspect sheet.<br/><br/>Option: For Red Herrings and "The Full Horror Is..." you may draw from the Untimely Death deck instead of the Negative Modifiers deck and work that element into your description.  Obviously it isn't you who met this tragic end.<br/><br/>Enjoy!<br/><br/>Jesse                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307878">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307878/#Comment_307878" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-12T06:54:14+00:00" title="January 12, 2011  6:54AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very cool build, and I love Gloom and the whole style of the game, so I will have to check this out <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307880/#Comment_307880" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-12T07:18:03+00:00" title="January 12, 2011  7:18AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 12, 2011 7:18AM by Graham.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's really lovely, Jesse. I don't know Gloom, so these comments will be startlingly ill-informed, but then you'll be used to that.<br/><br/>I like the Outsider. He sounds suitable for the creepy gothic family.<br/><br/>One thing to bear in mind, about the Black and White dice, is that they're a status mechanic. The Black die makes you active and nasty. The White die makes you passive and nice. So they play against each other: they encourage one player to become nasty, while the other becomes the victim.<br/><br/>And they encourage extremes of nastiness and passivity, too, so they're also a <i>comedy</i> mechanic, because extremes (and sudden shifts) in status are funny.<br/><br/>Events sound almost like a replacement for the rooms in the house.

All I ever wanted to preserve from Gloom into Legacy was the aesthetic.  I realized that A Taste For Murder pretty much does what I wanted Legacy to do (Legacy didn't have a murder mystery component but the disintegration of family dynamics is spot on).  Legacy, however, was designed to preserve the aesthetics of Gloom.  So, I just worked out how to use the Gloom deck to introduce those aesthetics into A Taste For Murder.<br/><br/>I've basically introduced an In A Wicked Age.... oracle into A Taste For Murder with the Gloom deck acting as the tables.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307920">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307920/#Comment_307920" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-12T12:45:47+00:00" title="January 12, 2011 12:45PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool!
