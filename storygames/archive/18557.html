My short game <b>Monster Box</b> is now available for free download from <a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/114342/Monster-Box" rel="nofollow">DriveThruRPG</a>. <br/><br/><b>Monster Box</b> is a role-playing game of kids with bonded pet monsters (in the style of Pokemon or Shadowstar).  You play as a kid (white d6), with one monster buddy and 2 monster pets (colored d6s). The colors of your dice should match the monsters you draw on your character sheet.  Each of your monsters has a different mechanical power (+1 on every roll, roll 2d3, reroll once, 6s explode, etc.).  You can describe your monster, and the effects of this power however you want. <br/><br/>Please download the game, read it, play it, and tell me what you think.  I would love to hear any questions, suggestions, or actual play experiences, but my specific questions are:<br/><br/>Are the rules clear?<br/>Is there any other material you would need to start playing this game right away?<br/>I am waiting for the game to be accepted at Indie Press Revolution. Are there any other sites where I should consider hosting this free game?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
