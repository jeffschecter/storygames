I think I'd only ever "be mousey" in that game if I was trying to show that my character was losing grip on what made him part of civilization.  You know, looking at a 6-Nature mouse with a bunch of checks, I'd just be nervous and jumpy and afraid of stuff but not necessarily like, being squeaky and stuff.  It's just not really part of the milieu.<br/><br/>Maybe in another game, maybe not.

It it were a part of a game, I'd engage in good faith. What I'm saying is: I want the game to tell me if this is a game about being mousey-mousey-mice and squeaking, or if it's not about that. Something like Animal Crime definitely straddles the line, but it tells you to play up the "animal comedy" aspect of it.<br/><br/>I have a friend who's working on a game where you play crows and can't speak except in caws and the like, and I'm super excited to play that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377818/#Comment_377818" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-11T11:44:08+00:00" title="May 11, 2012 11:44AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            While taking on animal characteristics is fun and imaginitive, some people I've played with find it puerile. <br/>\n<br/>\nI heartily encourage you to work it into a game as I'd like to see how it plays, but you should know your market.
