<div class="Message">
                    So in some prior discussions on stakes-setting, somebody (I think it was Jonathan Walton) suggested a set up where there were multiple stakes on the table.  There was a pirate captain involved in the example, and the question was: a) do you defeat the pirate, b) does the pirate hurt you, and c) does the pirate hurt your friends.  Players would then be splitting their resources between the three different goals depending on what they wanted to happen least, and the assumption was, I think, that the players probably couldn't win all three stakes, but they could maybe win two and they could certainly win one if they focused all their resources there.<br/><br/>Insert mental percolation for a month or two.<br/><br/>So now I'm considering this sort of similar system where, in any given conflict, there are a handful of default stakes that the players are in danger of losing.  In the course of using the CR system, they may be able to replace the standard stakes with specific stakes pertinent to the present situation.  They may or may not be able to cover up all the default stakes; haven't decided.<br/><br/>So what I need are "standard" bad repercussions that apply broadly to many different situations and conflicts.  I'm not sure if I need a fat list of them or three very well-selected stakes.  So I'm going to brainstorm out in the open.  Join me, will you?<br/><br/>The obvious ones are: (a) the PCs are hurt, (b) friendly NPCs are hurt, and (c) collateral damage.  These are the ancillary conflicts that are always bedevilling superheroes: "I could destroy the Purple Menace's ray gun, but that may level half the city!  And the masked villain has Jimmy hostage!"  Our hypothetical hero is looking at three stakes, "Destroy Ray Gun," "Collateral Damage," and "Friendly NPCs are hurt."  He has to decide how to split his resources between them.  (Procedurally, maybe whoever started the conflict covered up "the PCs are hurt" with "Destroy Ray Gun.")  In some later scene, where the hero is rescuing the kidnapped Jimmy from the big bad's island hideaway, there's no risk of collateral damage.  Then the stakes are more "The PCs are hurt," "Friendly NPCs are hurt," and "Defeat Purple Menace."<br/><br/>Now, outside of four-color comics, I can think of another "default bad repercussion" and that's Bad PR.  As in, you can win the "real" battle but you come away looking like an ass doing it.  Appropriate for some sort of game where the PCs are politically active and must maintain some measure of public goodwill.<br/><br/>(I'm starting to think that the default bad repercussions may be a thing set up per game, sort of like Praxis poles are set up for each game of Shock:.  It would lend a sort of thematic consistency when you're always trying to avoid similar ancillary repercussions as you confront the conflict-at-hand.)<br/><br/>What are some other relatively standard Bad Repercussions that PCs might want to avoid when they get their hands dirty in a game?  These can't be all there is.                </div>

                            That original post involved me aping Paul Czege's <i>The World, the Flesh, and the Devil</i> which really needs to be posted somewhere for posterity.<br/><br/>Your standardized stakes make sense if you have different types of traits/resources for the stakes to be applied to.  Frex, think about fallout in Dogs.  You have traits, you have relationships, you have character death.  Those are the three things that fallout can effect (as I recall).  You could also have fallout affect Stuff or your Coat or something in a different type of game.<br/><br/>So maybe you should determine what the main traits/resources/thingees that are important to play are and then have the bad stuff affect them.                        </div>

                            I guess there are two types of effects, really: currency effects and non-currency effects.  Currency can then be sub-divided into effect-triggering and conflict-influencing currency; the former being DnD hit point (lose all, trigger "unconscious/dying/dead" effect), the latter being roll penalties/lowered traits.  Some currencies are combinations thereof, such as WoD wounds or Polaris' Zeal/Weariness.<br/><br/>So first, as Jonathan said, you can look at all the resources in the game; those can all be affected.  DnD is such a crunchy game because there are lots of interconnected resources to be impacted: hit points, attributes, attack bonus, etc.  There are also effects like dazed, frightened, and so on.<br/><br/>But secondly, you can look at fictional events that are not numerical resources but that the player still cares about.  The character being humiliated, as was said; NPCs impacted (if they don't usually play into the conflict; if they do, they're resources); goals hindered or achieved...<br/><br/>So the currency effects will depend on your particular design.  The non-currency effects are probably genre-dependent to a certain degree.                        </div>

                            Been thinking this over a little bit and it reminded me of a game I thought had some potential in this area, Fireborn.<br/><br/>Basically the system in Fireborn is played on four squares arranged like so:<br/><br/><code>A | B<br/>--+--<br/>C | D</code><br/><br/>Each square corresponds to either active or passive/reactive, physical or mental. (There's also an association with the 4 alchemical elements which I don't remember.)<br/><br/>Dice are rolled in all four areas, and successes are counted. You can move dice from one to the other via the use of skills. So if you get 4 successes in your active physical to bop someone and they only get 2 successes in their passive physical to dodge you, you bopped them with a strength of 2. Similarly for mental actions.<br/><br/>One reason I thought Fireborn didn't go as far as it might have with this is that it would be really awesome for that to be a big mat in front of every player, instead it was relegated to the upper left of the character sheet. Bleah, how am I going to even fit 15 dice on that little spot so I feel like a badass?<br/><br/>And thinking about this now, you might expand it out to be a mat big enough for everybody to throw down on. Then the space with the most chips on it would be the 'tenor' of the scene. For example if everyone throws down in the active-physical quadrant, then the scene's all about bloody, wild, fightin' if it's a fight scene, and high-speed engine-gunning if it's a chase scene or whatnot, and if everyone throws down in the passive-physical quadrant, it's a tense, everything-gets-blocked endurance contest if it's a fight scene and a stealthy, gun-and-hide chase scene if it's a chase scene or whatnot. N.b. "whatnot" is a good word and you should use it more.  <br/><br/>Once everybody's chips were down you could resolve in some way?                        </div>

                            Thanks for the many considered responses, guys, and keep 'em coming.<br/><br/>I will note that I am looking primarily for non-mechanical, non-currency-interacting stakes.  I have the currency interaction part down; I'm looking for the flavor, color, and guidelines that will determine what the players do with the currency rules.  So I'm looking for, "You beat down the pirate, yeah, but he skewers your friend first."  Then there will be rules for handling what the pirate beat-down and the friend-skewering mean mechanically.  I need inspirational stakes at this point; the mechanics come later.<br/><br/>JD, yeah, I'm leaning towards playmat, or at least playspace in the middle of the table, with dice stacking up to indicate what's the big issue of the scene and focusing everyone's attention in interesting ways.                        </div>

                            Yes, but ( an additional cost)                        <br/> Yes, And ( an additional benefit)<br/> <br/>Yes ( Described Outcome)<br/> <br/>No, But (Partial success,weakened success)     <br/>No, And (Failure with additional negatives)<br/><br/>Are you talking about something as generic as that? As players place dice or whatever within one of those possibilities, they get to define the outcomes, with "Yes" being the first outcome and everything else being variants of it.                        </div>

<p><a href="http://www.nightskygames.com/" rel="nofollow">1001 Nights</a> does this admirably. You split resources between the various things you care about. If I recall, they're the character's safety, the character's goal, and something else. If you don't own it, you should. It's a great pick-up game and is very accessible.</p>

                            Ah, good call, Joshua.  That's exactly the kind of thing I'm thinking of.  And I am all but convinced that different games should have different sets of default stakes.                        </div>

                            Heya,<br/><br/>JBR, judging by your initial example and the desire to have "primarily for non-mechanical, non-currency-interacting stakes", I think the stakes themselves might be the resolution.  Let's say that in your game the GM gets to propose Three outcomes to the player who has a character in conflict.  One must be beneficial to the player's character, the other two must be harmful.  The player must then choose any 2.  <br/><br/>Every time there's a conflict, the GM makes the proposal and then the player chooses.  OR, the player can then Escalate the conflict.  The player may now suggest 1 outcome, but the GM gets to make up 3 negative possible outcomes.  The player must then select 3 of the new outcomes.<br/><br/>This kind of resolution is totally non-currency based, and only has very loose mechanics.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                        </div>
