However, I'm beginning to think I'm mistaken. Does anyone know if this was released as an Ashcan initially, and if so, what changes are there between this and the current version?<br/><br/>Also, for those that've played it a lot, how do you find the gathering of Xs works in play? I've only played in part of one game and it came off very stilted, with players coming up with conflicts solely to earn some Xs so the kick some arse later on. Is this others' experience, or is it a bit like 3:16: the rules read very mechanistic, like a simple boardgame, but when you play the roleplaying comes up sort of spontaneous out of the situations the characters find themselves in?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_240149">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240149/#Comment_240149" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-02T11:43:42+00:00" title="November  2, 2009 11:43AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The comparison with 3:16 is actually pretty much on target, in my experience.

Between the two, some GM notes were added, and a rule about the GM rolling to escalate (which I tend not to use). Perhaps other tweaks, but it didn't change much.<br/><br/>It reads mechanistically, like a boardgame, but it's really, really important that you don't play it like that. If you do, it's dull as hell. Let the pirates' ambitions drive the game, instead. Ask them, often, what they want to do. Also, get them off the boat. The best bits take place on shore.<br/><br/>I haven't found the gathering of Xs stilted. In my games, pirates don't need much prompting to be brutal.<br/><br/>Poison'd is one of my favourite games. It is a sure-fire hit every time I run it. However, other people have real difficulty with it, so there's <i>something</i> going on, some trick to running it that the rules don't explain. I hope Vincent does a second edition one day.<br/><br/>Oh! A couple more things. Unlike Eero, I think it's a very different game from 3:16. 3:16 is boardgamey and mechanical, and works because of it, whereas Poison'd only appears to be that way. <br/><br/>Also, judging from your spelling of "arse", you're probably English, so if you ever see me at a convention, I will happily run Poison'd for you.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_240152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240152/#Comment_240152" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-02T12:18:18+00:00" title="November  2, 2009 12:18PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've only read the game and have yet to play it, but it certainly seemed like a finished product to me.

The "resolution of the Captaincy" and the "initial decisions on who would be Captain" sound friendly and cooperative.    I would imagine it would be more like "After Thick Robin brained the first mate with a belaying pin and took over the captaincy, we decided to take it right to the King's sloop, be damned the condition of the ship."<br/>\n<br/>\nConditions in the game, as brought on by Cruel Fortunes, should be demanding enough that they drive the players to action because the characters have deal with the problems at hand.  Again, I haven't played it yet but that seems like enough to move the game forward.  To answer your question more directly, I think that within the structures of the Cruel Fortunes and various ship, crew and character attributes that yes there is a lot of room for "freeform" (or as it used to be called, "roleplaying" <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>).  The GM would be filling in details, providing colour with NPCs and the navy ships and so on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_240178">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240178/#Comment_240178" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-02T13:59:33+00:00" title="November  2, 2009  1:59PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 2, 2009 2:16PM by Graham.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's no prep. It all comes from the character's actions. As GM, do the following:<br><br>1. Encourage the players to follow their ambitions.<br/>2. Remind them where they are and ask what they do next. "Right, so you've got no Captain and the assassin is laughing at you. What do you do?"<br/>3. Incite player-vs-player conflict. "So he's stealing your stuff. Are you just going to take that?".<br/><br/>Player-vs-player stuff drives the game. If you don't have that, you're pretty much sunk.<br/><br/>Tell people that, if they die, they can make another pirate in no time. I once had a pirate die in the first five minutes, after fighting for the Captaincy, and I can't think why that doesn't always happen.<br/><br/>Don't focus on the Cruel Fortunes! They're sometimes interesting (especially the Kings Agents and the Constabulary), but they're mostly ship-based. Get off the ship. Really. The game looks like it's about hunting prizes at sea, but it really, really mustn't be. Focus on the Ambitions instead.<br/><br/>The rules are kind of weird. They do good things: as you'll see, when you're at the third level of escalation, and one roll of the dice tells you whether you die or the other guy does. But try sneaking up behind a guard and knocking him out and, suddenly, the rules become rickety. As GM, make instant rules calls, and gloss over bits like this. But they're great. The rules are great.<br/><br/>You've got a relationship map already: that's what the bargains are for.<br/><br/>I'm hoping that, if I mention it often enough, Vincent will write a Second Edition, with a text that fully explains how to run the game. This usually works: if you tell Vincent "You should write a game about badgers", the thought niggles away at him until he writes a game about badgers. (He will read this, and laugh, and then start wondering how to write a game about badgers. Expect a game about badgers around December 2010).<br/><br/>Graham                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_240184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adrian%20P" title="Adrian P"><img alt="Adrian P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adrian%20P">Adrian P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240184/#Comment_240184" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-02T14:15:31+00:00" title="November  2, 2009  2:15PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 2, 2009 2:17PM by Adrian P.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Walkerp: yes, there was a lot of arguing and posturing and being nasty; no, it did not ultimately result in an engaging game in the one instance where I played. Were we 'playng it wrong'? Possibly, but it certainly took on the shape of the game I had heard about, and I feel secure that we did not entirely miss the point of the game or anything like that.<br/><br/>What we found is there's a strong implied set of behaviour, initial conflicts and stuff to do, but once we scratched beneath that the impetus behind the game started to get a bit aimless and fell flat, I think due to the lack of injected-events/dilemmas/crises by the GM coupled with aimlessness from the players - in the absence of other things to do, players started chasing Xs through arbitrary conflicts, which felt back-to-front, and the conflicts consequently feeling contrived. I think Graham's on to something with advice to get the characters off of the ship, and to focus on the pirates' ambitions.<br/><br/>What I'm ideally looking for is advice from people who've played a few sessions, maybe even a mini-campaign, and what that looked like, especially the level of prep involved (is it like In a Wicked Age, essentially prep-less? Or Trollbabe, with NPCs, a location, something at stake? Or more than that?), and what for them, made the game 'sing'.<br/><br/>By the way, for clarification, when I said 'freeform' I meant low-to-no prep, nothing to do with the level of roleplaying involved.<br/><br/>Edit: cross-posted with Graham. Thanks, that's all sounding like good advice.

You know the Navy isn't there at the start, right? They're coming for you, but they're not there yet. The Urgency card deals with that.<br/><br/>We usually find two ship battles in a row are too much. If the pirates fight their first battle and lose, leaving them with no treasure, don't let them go off to do another one. Get them off the ship, even if they've got no treasure.<br/><br/>Oh, another thing, which falls into the category of "It's not really a mechanical game". You needn't always deal with things in the way the mechanics suggest: for example, you can take out a fortress by sneaking into it, rather than doing a ship battle; you can get a night ashore by threatening someone or stealing someone's cash at knifepoint. All that is fine. The mechanics are not constraints: they don't say "This is the only way you can defeat a fortress / spend a night ashore".<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_240387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adrian%20P" title="Adrian P"><img alt="Adrian P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adrian%20P">Adrian P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240387/#Comment_240387" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-04T04:28:57+00:00" title="November  4, 2009  4:28AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, if I recall correctly the navy ship was on us pretty much after Tom was killed - the pressure for a new Captain came from the navy looming down on us. Maybe the GM got a lucky roll with the Urgency, but I don't recall that happening.<br/><br/>Thanks for the advice on dealing with things like Fortress outside of combat - I had the definite impression that shore leave is not allowed without Leisure stuck in my head, so it's a good thing to remind me of alternatives.<br/><br/>Cheers for all the advice and help people have given!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_240448">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240448/#Comment_240448" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-04T11:14:59+00:00" title="November  4, 2009 11:14AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As far as I can tell, the Resolute *always* shows up with the first roll.
