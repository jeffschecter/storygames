Early in the process of creating or experiencing a story, a Premise is best understood as a proposition or perhaps an ideological challenge to the world represented by the protagonist's passions. Later in the process, resolving the conflicts of the story transforms Premise into a theme - a judgmental statement about how to act, behave, or believe. In role-playing, "protagonist" typically indicates a character mainly controlled by one person. A defining feature of Story Now.<br/></blockquote>\nClear as mud, right? Okay - so, when we say "story", or "Story Now", or whatever, that doesn't necessarily dovetail at ALL with what Ron's driving at, here. In the other thread, it was suggested that process, not end result, was a defining feature of N vs. S. I say we go one step further and say that firm player authorship of theme is where we really get a-going. <br/><br/>What do I mean? Two big things are happening with Narrativism (with AP examples to follow): <br/>- PCs have a ton of power to affect and guide the direction of the plot.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Exception:</span> incredibly tight premises are acceptable, such as that of <i>The Mountain Witch</i>.<br/>- The game text asks moral/ethical questions that begin the story. These questions may be implied by the setting, in such a manner that they're basically asking "Now what?" The setting itself (see: Polaris), or tools offered up by the game, will enable the question to be asked openly.<br/><br/>So - lots of power for everybody, AND nothing's really set in stone yet. <i>Polaris</i> is a tragedy, yeah, but the point of the game is to decide what one does with the impossible scenario put forth by the text. <br/><br/>Genre emulation is tangential to Narrativism. The setting, for Nar, is important, but mainly insofar as it creates enjoyable Color and provides a right-feeling space for the Big Question. Or, more likely, the setting draws us in, and then the setting choice puts limits on what kinds of Big Questions we can answer. <br/><br/><i>Carry</i> is probably not the right vehicle for discussing the interplay of family life, for example.<br/><br/>Just because you're using explicit tools of story-craft doesn't mean you're doing Narrativism. There needs to be a pregnant ethical dilemma at hand, one which is resolved through play. And the players need to be able to make important decisions towards that end. Without both of those things, you don't have Narrativism.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271222/#Comment_271222" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-14T16:25:05+00:00" title="May 14, 2010  4:25PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2010 4:55PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel compelled to add that stories with a "generalizable, problematic aspect of human interaction" aren't rare. We all know them, and know them well. <br/><br/>The Conan story <i>The Tower of the Elephant</i>, the stories found in <i>The Martian Chronicles</i>, the books of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>; the movies <i>Jaws, Die Hard</i> and <i>Aliens</i>; the television shows <i>The Shield, Breaking Bad</i>, and <i>Battlestar Galatica</i>; the plays <i>Macbeth, Glengary Glenn Ross</i>, and <i>Antigone</i> all have a generalizable, problematic aspects of human interaction.  <br/><br/>In short, most stories do. Some stories are ham-fisted about it and some are brilliant, some are blunt and some are subtle. But almost every story people bother to remember have this quality to some degree or another.<br/><br/>There's nothing odd or rarified about the notion at all.<br/><br/>The thrill of playing things like <i>In a Wicked Age...</i> or <i>HeroQuest</i> in Glorantha or <i>Sorcerer</i> or <i>Polaris</i> or what have you is that you, as a Player, get to wrestle with these problematic aspect of human interactions the same way any writer who knows his job does. <br/><br/>You also get to do it socially, which makes it a hell of a lot more fun. You also have to do it on the fly, in public, which makes it a hell of a challenge.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_271283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271283/#Comment_271283" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-14T19:06:23+00:00" title="May 14, 2010  7:06PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good point, CK!
