Her character had been hurriedly returned to prison because her meddling parents had launched a lawsuit against the prison for its bad treatment of the prisoners there.  As it turned out this was the plan of a superintelligent crimeboss to get her to do some work for him. She agreed to do it. Another PC criticized her for this decision somewhat.<br/><br/>Wife's character: "Look, when the Agency put me back inside, they said they'd 'work real hard' at getting me back outside as soon as they could, and I think they are. Joey Torres said I'd be released 'as soon as possible' and I was out before dinner. Who has the real power here?"<br/><br/>It was awesome. I was trying to emphasize how the bad guys had the upper hand in the setting and she totally got it.<br/><br/>A little later on the mission, they managed to take a thug who had turned on the crimeboss prisoner and obtained information from him, they were debating whether to turn him over to the police, turn him loose, or turn him over to the crimeboss' minions for 'closure of the relationship'.  <br/><br/>Other character: "You think they can't get this guy in jail? Turning him over to the police is just like turning him over to the Familia."<br/><br/>Wife's character: "Except that we don't get any credit or benefit in any way."<br/><br/><img alt="&lt;3" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/heart.png" title="&lt;3"/><br/><img alt="&lt;3" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/heart.png" title="&lt;3"/><br/><img alt="&lt;3" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/heart.png" title="&lt;3"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58988/#Comment_58988" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-05T06:54:26+00:00" title="March  5, 2007  6:54AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hah, that's pretty cool.<br/><br/>Overall, it sounds like Jaded Superheroes.

My wife frequently "gets me" when I run games and while she doesn't express it directly in character the way your wife does, she directs her actions to my cues at times and makes my life easier.<br/>\n<br/>\n   The campaign setting sounds very interesting, a nice mash-up.

That fits the tone of the game, which is about the limits of their power. Still, they will be able to become key players once the metaplot begins to play out, they will be in a unique position to influence matters. So will they make a 'dent'? Possibly. It depends on how quickly they become corrupt. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Re: AP - no, I haven't written up any AP reports.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D" title="Thomas D"><img alt="Thomas D" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://landfill.thesnakefarm.com/images/misc/idescols.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D">Thomas D</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59125/#Comment_59125" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-05T16:17:31+00:00" title="March  5, 2007  4:17PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As I was reading over the writeup for the game, I was thinking that I'd like to play in the game.
