                    Hey all, I was tossing the idea around of the possibility of running a one-shot or mini-campaign of a hyper-Korean-fantasy game. But aside from the food and the dress/garb, I'm not too sure what elements I could include that would be distinctly Korean.<br/>I mean, for Japan we have (depending on era and all): Calligraphy, Mikkyo, Samurai/Ninja, "HONOR!" ("You drop a chopstick". "Fuck! OK, I commit seppuku").<br/>For China we have Kung Fu, Teahouses, Shaolin monks, magistrates, trade, etc.<br/>For Mongolia we have horses and those domed fur tent things.<br/>For Cambodia we have all those cool ruins.<br/><br/>What are some brief elements of Korean history that could be ported to a fantasy setting? Not looking for essays particularly, just little things here and there that I can hunt for more information about. <br/><br/>-Andy                </div>

<p><em>From the wikipedia:</em> "The idea of a beast becoming fully human is in fact quite heavily embedded in Korean mythology, such as the case in which a bear becomes a woman through a harsh ordeal in the Dangun mythology. They represent the widely appreciated Korean values of patience, virtue, and self-sacrifice."</p>
<p>That sounds damn interesting for gameplay. The wikipedia page:<br/>

                            The caste system is pretty heavily emphasized in <i>Musa</i>, where you have the nobility (who are the military officers), the peasant-soldiers (who have to work their way up through the ranks), and then a slave class.  Lots of yummy conflict potential there.<br/><br/>Also seems like, historically, the Koreans (or the people of Goryeo or Joseon or whatever) were always fighting either 1) Japanese invaders, 2) the northern "barbarian" tribes (Mongols, Khitan, Jurchen, etc.), or, occasionally, 3) the Chinese, who wanted to make them a tributary state.<br/><br/>Also, the legendary founders of ancient Korea, supposedly had between 1-3 heavenly objects that gave them supernatural powers, as well as being signs of the mandate to govern, which sounds like good mcguffins to base play off of.<br/><br/>Yeah, and the people-who-used-to-be-animals thing.  Very cool.                        </div>

                            I know all their period piece movies these days are terribly, terribly tragic.  In fact, so much so I'd probably run something like that using Polaris or Falling Leaves to maximize the drama. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            I've just read through that Wikipedia entry that Jason linked, which was superb.<br/>
<br/>
If, as the article says, the three main categories of Korean mythology are shamanistic, Taoist and Buddhist, then I'd definitely go for the shamanistic, to distinguish it from Chinese.<br/>
<br/>
And shamen and totems are very cool. Lots of potential there.<br/>

                            The conflict that stands out most for me in Korean history is Admiral Yi Sun-sin's fighting off of the Japanese with ironclad <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_ship" rel="nofollow"><b>Turtle ships</b></a> in the Seven-Year War starting in 1592.  Related to that would be fighting Japanese pirates with similar ships, particular in the century before then.  That's certainly one of the most celebrated fights in Korean history.<br/><br/>You might also look at 668 A.D. -- the defeat of Baekje and Goguryeo by the alliance of the Korean Silla kingdom with the Tang Chinese.  The fall of Goguryeo is considered a tragic turning point in the history of Korea -- uniting the country for the first time, but at the price of surrendering much of Manchuria over to China.                        </div>

                            I once presented an elven culture inspired by many elements of Korean culture in my own FRPG campaign to highlight their "exotic" nature. <br/><br/>I used these features in great effect:<br/> focusing on archery (Koreans are still sweeping golds in major archery games) <br/> incorporating song and dance in everyday life<br/> white linen clothes with their distinguishing designs<br/> exotic fermented vegetables (white kimchi: kimchi was not spicy until peppers were imported in 16th century)<br/> fiercely independent nature (they have been persistently protecting their independence throughout the history. Unfortunately, it developed into sticking to "racial purity", making them very xenophobic people. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hines_Ward" rel="nofollow">Hines Ward</a> syndrome seems to change their thoughts now)<br/> unique, systematic phonetic alphabet system (I highly recommend you to <a href="http://www.langintro.com/kintro/toc.htm" rel="nofollow">learn the Hangul characters</a> even if you don't learn the language itself. It is simply a great system)<br/> other cultural bits, such as the first metal moveable type technology in the world<br/><br/>Some features of Korean culture directly opposes to those of "typical elven culture", like its almost Totalitarian nature. As an agricultural society (and heavily influenced by Confucianism), hierarchy, conformity and close relationship with families and neighbors have been strongly emphasized. The fervent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Devil" rel="nofollow">Red Devils</a> in which practically every Korean participated during 2002 World Cup could be an example of showing their collective-forming energy (perhaps in a positive way).<br/><br/>...Well, I just couldn't help speaking about my own culture. :P                        </div>

                            Andy, I'd suggest checking out a couple of medieval Korean costume dramas.  I'm a big fan of "The Age of Warriors," though I don't understand anything about the historical context or who anyone is.<br/>
<br/>
It is an unbelievably awesome show.  A typical scene involves a dozen dudes you've never seen before, sitting around a table in their compound saying, "Wow, the Emperor/Warlord/Archfiend (there's an awesome character called "Archfiend," everyone's like, "Good day, Archfiend!")/rival clan is totally out of control.  We need to rein them in!" <br/>
<br/>
And then someone says, "Ahhhhhh."  And strokes their chin thoughtfully.<br/>
<br/>
And someone else says, "We should strike immediately.  I have this great plan (details plan) (you sit there and say, "yes, yes, have a scene just like that, immediately!")<br/>
<br/>
And someone else says, "Hmmmmmm."  And strokes their chin thoughtfully.<br/>
<br/>
And then the leader of the group says, "That would reveal our hand too quickly.  Let's sit on it, and wait.  Right now, let's do nothing."  (And you sit there and are like, "aggggh, that's what they always say!")<br/>
<br/>
And everyone nods.  And that's the end of the scene, and you never see those dudes again!<br/>
<br/>
--And then cut to a new scene, where it's 12 more people you've never seen before, and will never see again!  And they have the exact same conversation-- "Let's do something cool!" "No, let's wait and see."<br/>
<br/>
So--to answer the question--based on watching a zillion episodes of "Age of Warriors," it looks like a HUGE part of Korean medieval aristocratic life was spent sitting around arguing about staging coups, counter-coups, and counter-counter-coups.  But mostly people just scheme all the time and never do anything.  <br/>
<br/>
And you should totally have a character called "Archfiend" by everyone, including his wives and children.  His interests should include having pretty wives, wielding battle axes, and indulging in furious "now you must die" fits of laughter.<br/>
<br/>
(I speak as someone who is a huge fan of this show, yet remain in utter ignorance about anything else, and beg  the indulgence of those who know better.)                        </div>
