How did the players react to stuff that happened?  How did the game shape their interaction?  Another important thing is to note where and how the game's rules helped, and where and how they hindered.  Express how using the game you used made it different from using any other particular game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Russell_Collins" title="Russell_Collins"><img alt="Russell_Collins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.clockworkaudio.net/images/russfacesmall.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Russell_Collins">Russell_Collins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61497/#Comment_61497" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-19T05:05:40+00:00" title="March 19, 2007  5:05AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Unless you are the first person writing about a new game, skip as much description of the premise as possible. Avoid line-by-line recounting of the session. Drill down to one or two superlative events and base your discsussion around them.<br/><br/>I don't know where to begin to comment when 3 pages of play-as-dialog is presented and I am then asked for my thoughts. If the conversation has a focus on a special trait of the game play or players then discussion will be more constructive. If the game only offered subjects that are general to other games, don't post it as actual play for that game, just a request for general input.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61501/#Comment_61501" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-19T05:54:54+00:00" title="March 19, 2007  5:54AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 19, 2007 6:06AM by James_Nostack.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you <i>are</i> inclined to summarize, each scene should be 2 sentences (set-up, execution) unless there's something particularly curious or amazing going on.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso - if i have to scroll down three times or more to read your post, it's giving me too much information.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61503/#Comment_61503" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-19T06:27:54+00:00" title="March 19, 2007  6:27AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 19, 2007 6:31AM by PaulCzege.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Tony,<br><br>A great Actual Play post centers on what you learned.

I suspect the game's author, other game designers, the GM prepping for her first game, and the RPG fan trying to decide whether to buy the game are all looking for different things.  For my part (usually falling in one of the last two categories, or in the fifth category of "passerby"), I want to know how the game product <i>feels</i>, how the specific play example unfolded at the table in broad, well-organized descriptions, and how people at the table reacted to the game system and setting.  I don't want the minutia of an entire PbB simply pasted into a thread (though I understand it is very useful as a record for the people playing the game -- it just doesn't make good reading for anyone else.)  <br/><br/>I like the AP to be organized in clear sections: \n<ul><li>premise</li>\n<li>who was involved (players/characters)</li>\n<li>description of play, divided in scenes</li>\n<li>brief analysis of good and bad points</li>\n<li>GM and player's comments and insights</li></ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
