It is not intended to appeal to traditional role-players, although it is intended to appeal to people dissatisfied with role-playing."<br/><br/>One cool bit of Inuma: There is no character ownership, but every character collaboratively created is playable, and rules change based on their function in the story - protagonist, antagonist, supporting character.<br/><br/>Another: You create the world as you play, and document it in development. The game is designed so that this document can be picked up later on, by other people, and added to. Sort of a roleplaying geocache log or something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_297951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297951/#Comment_297951" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-22T07:13:31+00:00" title="October 22, 2010  7:13AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=462" rel="nofollow">Rock of Tahamaat</a> was written by Vincent Baker as an attempt to explain the idea behind IIEE (intent, initiation, execution, effect). I think it does a cool job of showing how "blocking" or randomizing a player/character's progress from intent to effect at various steps can produce different kinds of fiction. Playing the Rock is different than playing the unfortunates of Kaliste, because his intent is "divined" and only the "effect" reported back to him, while they actually go through the whole process, hands on the wheel.<br/><br/>I also really like the idea that the Rock's stats are not his own abilities but rather the qualities of his various servants. I think it's a cool way to show (besides the core mechanic) the isolation of someone in power and his dependence on those that mediate between him and the everyday world.<br/><br/>As far as colour is concerned, it's a very vague but cool space opera/pulp setting where the 8 feet tall Space Tyrant know as Rock of Tahamaat reigns over the asteroid world of Kaliste and far beyond it. One player is the Rock, one player is the GM or mediator/facilitator and the other players are people whose lives got destroyed by the Space Tyrant and are now acting out of desperation to bring him down (or whatever).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297957/#Comment_297957" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-22T08:26:42+00:00" title="October 22, 2010  8:26AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.geocities.com/zozergames/zenobia.html" rel="nofollow">Zenobia</a> is a lovingly detailed game set in a fantasy version of the Roman Empire, but way out on the eastern fringes.
