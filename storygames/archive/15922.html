Start with only people you like and communicate well with.<br/>\n<br/>\n90% of Traumatic D&amp;D; Stories involve someone who should not have been at the table. Send that person packing. If you can't, do not play a chaotic, unfocused, crazyplayer Old School game for the first time. Do not do it. Do not do it. They will help you ruin your game.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Forget Static Creative Agendas<br/>\n<br/>\nThe whole game thrives on the players having conflicting creative agendas--this is what makes the game happen. This one acts while this one strategizes while this one tries to shape the plot. As long as everyone's happy you _can_ juggle those chainsaws--all in the same combat round. Believe me.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Forget Your Plot<br/>\n<br/>\nYour players will pickpocket and babykill their way out of any plot. They will slay your plot and build their own. This is good. This is God's work. Give them a playground, not a Yellow Brick Road.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Prep Like A Lunatic At Least In The Beginning<br/>\n<br/>\nYou need contingency plans. And contingency plans for the contingency plans.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. Use Random Tables<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy do old schoolers love random tables? We need them. On Saturday my PCs have literally 29 locations they could go to. At any speed. When they arrive, I need things for them to hit<br/>\n<br/>\n6. Use Abulafia.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's fast, it's full of goodness.<br/>\n<br/>\n7. Make Sure Everyone IsCool With Whats Going On<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the players get TPKed and then immediately roll new characters, you know you are running a good game. But otherwise the signs can be subtle. If anything sucky happens to anyone, make sure they are cool with what is going on<br/>\n<br/>\n8. Split XP Evenly Between The Whole Group Unless You Want Backstabbing<br/>\n<br/>\n9. Embrace the Roguish Work Ethic<br/>\n<br/>\n<a href="http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/2010/01/rogues-and-sandboxes-basic-edition.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/2010/01/rogues-and-sandboxes-basic-edition.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n10. High Fantasy Heroism Is Not What This Game Is About<br/>\n<br/>\nYour players are The Grey Mouser and Cugel and suchlike. If you do not recognize those names, get googlin then get readin'.<br/>\n<br/>\n11. Death Is Ok<br/>\n<br/>\n12. Fear of Death Is The Mother Of Invention<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your players are worried they'll die, it makes them think.<br/>\n<br/>\n13. In Setting Up The World, Be Inventive<br/>\n<br/>\n14. In Adjudicating The Play, Be Merciless<br/>\n<br/>\nNever fudge, never re-roll. The world is a puzzle to be solved, not dream-stuff to be manipulated<br/>\n<br/>\n15. Give PCs Resources You Don't Know How They'll Use<br/>\n<br/>\nPotion that turns anything blue. Door that removes all inorganic material from anything passing through it.<br/>\n<br/>\n16. Your NPCs Suck And Are Going To Die<br/>\n<br/>\nThe players are the thing. They may like your NPCs--but probably they will ignore them and focus on what they are wearing.<br/>\n<br/>\n17. Don't Let Character Gen Take Too Long<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it does, then the player gets attached to the PC-as-born rather than the PC-as-made-by-play<br/>\n<br/>\n18. Find a Way To Make Everything That Happens Matter<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you fail your second roll to sneak into the orc camp rather than your third roll, the consequences should be different<br/>\n<br/>\n19. You Play, Your Stats Don't<br/>\n<br/>\nThis kind of play is based largely on "Pawn" stance. Don't get hung up on "who your PC is supposed to be" the PC is a tool to solve problems which you slowly get in tune with. Sometimes you become the axe gnome, sometimes the axe gnome becomes you, sometimes you die, rolll 3d6 in order and now you are a sword dwarf<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT:<br/>\n<br/>\n20. Always Consequences.

Shit like player-kills, stolen loot, hidden alignment, backstabbing and murder and stuff were all common place in our games.  <br><br>It was incredibly fun.  Super wicked great and I think fondly on every second of it, even when I remember hating my friends for killing my precious pet character.  <br><br>I think what made this fun / bearable was that we didn't take it as seriously as I seem to take games now.  Like, if I put time and effort into a character then, to have him killed was more a case of "oh, shit, I should have been more careful around you assholes" and now, if I put a ton of time and effort into a character, I guess I expect that everyone will respect that, or maybe the games I play in now are more character-driven (vs plot or world driven) and so I don't see that level of direct PVP action.  I don't know what's different.  I know why it worked, though - we all knew what we were getting into, we'd discuss it in depth with new players.  We'd talk up how much fun it was to get one-over on each other and there was a degree of fun, friendly competition.  I don't remember anyone really getting upset about something that happened.<br><br>Our DM was INTEGRAL to the play style.  If you were going to helm a game, you had to know what shitheads we all were and be able to adapt.  To be fair, even and reasonable to everyone and to stick to your guns when you made a rules call.  We never once blamed the DM for favouritism or gave whoever it happened to be a hard time.  We believed that the DM made the final call and that was that.  If you didn't like it, roll up a new character and ready yourself for next time, you might be the one to find a new loophole.  The DM had the world to run and wasn't babysitting us.  If he said "a dragon is menacing the town of Wherever" and we said "fuck you, we don't care" you best believe that town would be ruins when we visited it months later.  There was a plot going on in every game but our engagement in it was up to us. <br><br>I think, too, outside the game and the rules and everything, the reason it worked was because we separated our characters from ourselves.  "I killed you because I am Lawful Evil and you are Chaotic Good" was a completely valid answer.  So was "I am a Drow and you are a filthy wood elf." or "I wanted your Ring of Invisibility".  We accepted these things as character motivations and, as Justin Achilli once put it, we relied so heavily on the "Nuremburg Defense of Gaming" that it because common place.  We weren't apologists for our characters.  If you made a character who was a total friendless dick, mind you, you'd get beat down for it eventually.  <br><br>The game that feels the most like my early D&amp;D play, now?  Diplomacy.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362102/#Comment_362102" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T22:08:56+00:00" title="February 23, 2012 10:08PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: PeterBB</cite><a href="/forums/profile/Zak">@Zak</a>: I would play the shit out of that game.<br><br>My problem is that no one around here knows how to run it, and I haven't got the skills (or frankly the patience).

I never felt like we were trying to out-badass each other.  Just that, sometimes, a PC would do a thing and you'd respond "in character" and, because PCs are sometimes violent individuals (or sneaky and murderous or worship foul entities or WHATEVER) you come to a place where one of you has to tear up your character sheet and start a new "guy".  And maybe that guy has a vendetta to carry out against the guy who murdered your last dude.  Or maybe not - maybe you just wanted to be an Abjurer this time.<br><br>Character-creation-excitement / new class-race-alignment ADD can be a very powerful "get over it" motivator.<br><br>Also, to address "orc baby killing" in my experience, drawing from that very-heavily "acting out / PVP / game mode we're discussing here" style, it was something that came up a lot.  We'd capture prisoners or come across questionable circumstances but it was never an out-of-game dilemma that I can remember.  It was;<br><br>a) What's your alignment?  Do what that says you ought to do.<br>b) Don't like that?  Explain why you're not doing it, Mr Chaotic Evil.<br>c) Someone else want to do a thing that your alignment doesn't agree with?  Try and stop them with words or your swords or whatever.<br>d) Are you going to fight them over it?  If not, consider vengeance later.  If so, cool!<br>e) It's over.  Someone won the argument, or you came to an agreement and maybe somebody died over it.  It's cool that they stood up to you and won or lost.  Moving on.<br><br>Players didn't have alignments, their characters did, right?  Sometimes it was fun to see what it would be like to have incredibly strict moral codes / be a chaotic villain out for blood.  It was seen as experimentation and play - not serious commentary on anything, really.  Playing your alignment was pretty heavily policed by everyone in our group, though we kept our alignment a secret from everyone but the GM so as not to be exploited for it.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362119/#Comment_362119" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T22:28:20+00:00" title="February 23, 2012 10:28PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is how we do alignment.

The group of players has been more or less stable, but the PC changed in every "season" of the game. In the first season, PCs ended working for the main villain instead of stopping him. The setting is actually made to suggest that PCs with supernatural backgrounds are most of the time feared or hated by common humans. There's even a twisted incarnation of the Inquisition in the game, which actively pursues and destroys supernatural beings, such as the PCs themselves.<br><br>So the players were between a rock and a hard place: on one side the humans and on the other the main villain, who also was a powerful supernatural being as them. Now, this guy, instead of rejecting humankind, was trying to make them evolve and grow stronger by exposing them to the worst dangers he could place in the world. And suddenly the PCs were in the middle of liking that concept and not being able to directly oppose that villain... and had already acted against humans -by accident, of course- so the choice of serving the powers of evil came easy to them.<br><br>Even when I gave PCs a chance to free and redeem themselves, they only took it partially and one even choose to remain faithful to the main villain. All in all it became a really interesting starting point for the campaign. Of course, in the next season, I had them made new characters and confronted them against the old ones, who now were more powerful generals of the dark lord. We even used a mechanic that we called "villain of the day": one of the players used his old PC and got a task from the dark lord, concerning the new PCs, either to stop, capture, misguide them or recover an item from them. Every session, a different villain was used by each player, while the others had to deal with him with their less powerful PCs. That also took a lot of the load off me as a GM.<br><br>In the last season the players created a fanatic cult of their own, positioning themselves as the high priests of the cult. They even invested skill points to became more convincing leaders and manipulate a whole city into following them, creating their own sacred books and everything.<br><br>It's been a hell of fun -literally- it all comes from people actually rolling with it, and the GM has to be the main example of that disposition. Of course, it makes railroading -even <i>good railroading</i>, if we can use the term in such way- almost impossible. It demands quick reactions from the GM, especially being able to adapt to the changing mood and frame new scenes and situations to match the players feelings, instead of pulling and pushing them into a particular feeling with plot hooks, blocks, distractors and excuses.<br><br>So, the only thing we didin't had from the list was pickpocketing among PCs. but that was because:<br>1- Anima doesn't use alignments, so players get freedom of action and don't have a mechanic excuse to fight among themselves.<br>2- The setting is dangerous enough so one member of the team alone can't make it, even if he goes to a big city -especially if he goes to a big city. They see it's better to stay as a team.<br>3- players don't get xp for killing monsters individually, they get it for roleplaying, good ideas and teamwork; so since there isn't any benefit on playing solo, players naturally don't see a point in antisocial behavior.<br><br>It doesn't mean it hasn't happened, it's just that there was space in the game for everything, and I always made an effort to include that in the fiction, so the event didn't interrupted the play, becaming instead an interesting variation to the usual session. I believe that simple mechanics could help prevent unconfortable situations in the table, and some tolerant gaming philosophy can help ease such situations once they appear, without resorting yet to taking the problematic players apart and having a talk with them.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362124">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362124/#Comment_362124" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T22:32:45+00:00" title="February 23, 2012 10:32PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            System hacking was a cardinal sin for my group.

If somebody wants me to explain more about this issue, start another thread or something. k? Thanks.<br><br>This kind of game does exhibit a single, coherent Creative Agenda, specifically Gamism of a certain stripe. Sometimes it *looks* like something else, but it isn't. The GM is basically a referee, and runs the world as a simulation, but it's not Simulationism. Sometimes there's a sort of story, in a picaresque kind of way, even with morality involved, but it's not Narrativism.<br><br>Lemme explain. <br>1) If you take this kind of game and strip everything down to the skeleton, it's about problem solving. A dungeon is a problem: how do I get the loot out of here without dying? A monster is a problem: how do I neutralize or avoid this thing without dying? An NPC is a problem: how do I get what I want from this dude? Other players are a problem: how can I exploit these guys for personal gain without losing the collective gain we get from working together? And so on. Sometimes players will take some problems less seriously than others, but that doesn't make it any less Gamist.<br><br>2) Players set their own victory conditions. When they achieve them, they win. This is where it can start to look like so-and-so is trying to shape plot or address Premise or whatever, but that's not what's happening. The player is just pursuing a victory condition that happens to look story-ish. Now, the ref runs the world as a simulation, so when the players push, it pushes back, which creates problems that need solving, and that's where this becomes a Gamist thing, because the player is merely concerned with tackling those problems in order to win in his own fashion. And sometimes these victory conditions are very small! At this very moment, one player might be trying to become king of Kansas, while another mostly just wants to get X character in bed, while player 3 wants to kill as many orcs as he can, and player 4 will feel like he won if he just survives this round of combat.<br><br>More about other issues to come later.

This is because there were really only two reasons why our characters did ANYTHING back then:<br><br>1) It was funny<br><br>or, more often<br><br>2) It was what we thought would solve the immediate problems that came up in the game.<br><br>We did role-play our characters a little if we had concepts we thought were cool, but all of that took a back seat to problem-solving because at the time that's where we thought the handles of the game were, regardless of what we were playing (as I recall mainly 2nd Edition AD&amp;D, Shadowrun, Talislanta and various home-brewed games). We were used to playing arcade games and early computer games and that's where we thought the fun was. So we did WHATEVER IT TOOK to deal with the problems in front of us, whether that involved stealing something from another PC, restoring lost artifacts to churches, slaying orc babies or rescuing orphans. If looked at psychologically, most of our PCs would probably have been considered amoral sociopaths (or possibly psychopaths, not quite sure).<br><br>Ultimately I found I was dissatisfied with the results of that, and eventually realized I was more interested in playing the character than "winning the game" through solving any and all problems thrown at my PC. So I started gearing my style of play more toward role-playing and discovered I had a lot more fun with it (which makes sense because I turned out to be a theatre guy).<br><br>I don't know if I'd be able to play the game the old way again. I might be if I try to look at it as more of a board game. But, knowing me, I'd probably end up drifting back to "RP First" mode because, to be frank, while I was shy and introverted as a teenager, as an adult I'm an incorrigible ham. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362304/#Comment_362304" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T09:07:45+00:00" title="February 24, 2012  9:07AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2012 9:09AM by Zak S.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Marshall">@Marshall</a> Burns<br/>\n<br/>\n"Your NPCs Suck And are Going To Die" is actually Jeff Rients<br/>\n<br/>\nFor my game in particular:<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not recognize "gamism" as a rational word.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can say that all players being into "challenge-based play" and goals is absolutely not the case here.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people have goals in the game, some just enjoy showing up and Being Their PC (much like self-confessed "theatre guy" otherdoc describes).<br/>\n<br/>\nI have highlighted PCs that have goals in the game (often temporary, arbitrary, and quickly forgotten) because those PCs are the ones that are the engine of exploration in the game (the theatre-player is easy, s/he takes things slower).

good and went to hell in the course of a year. By hell I mean all night long sessions where 65% ot the time was wasted in arguments about the rules, 10% looking in the corebooks for the rules, 15% off-topic chit-chat, 8% getting something to eat and devouring it and 2% of actual roleplaying, doing something in-game. Ok, the percentages used aren't that literal, they are more like the perception I have of those sessions but you get the idea.<br/><br/>Now, as I said, at first we had some fun. We actually followed the plot and succesfully solved some problems thinking out of the box. Low levels felt epic without the dragon-slaying and god-killing part, they just were simple but heroic. And then something changed. It felt like the GM decided to drop the silk gloves (we didn't know he had been using it all the time) and started to beat us hard. Suddenly all of our tactical choices didn't made any good and thinking out of the box was punished with literal use of the rules from the GM side. Preparations failed per GM fiat and our decisions were misinterpretated, sometimes out of chaos at the table, sometimes just because the GM wanted to have his fun by winning every single combat.<br/><br/>Then the orcbabykilling, PvP, pickpocketing, and antisocial behaviour started. I became a sort of power-gamer for a while in order to protect my character/my fun and when even that failed I lost interest/got too mad with the game to keep playing it. Some of my friends still play with that GM, the guy knows the rules and it's a good pal. But most of us insist he's the worst GM ever and wouldn't play another single session with him.<br/><br/>I'd say that from the moment I, as a player, have to take action to protect "my fun" against other players/the GM, is when "our fun" is ruined. And then something in the social pact brokens and either it starts to work in another way or kicks players out of the game, if not out of the friendship in the most extreme cases.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362334/#Comment_362334" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T10:08:37+00:00" title="February 24, 2012 10:08AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/warriormonk">@warriormonk</a><br/>\n<br/>\nsounds like a terrible GM right there                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362336/#Comment_362336" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T10:12:19+00:00" title="February 24, 2012 10:12AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Zak,<br>Cool. So, all I have to go on is the AP reports you've put on your blog, so I've got limited information, but it sounds like the stuff that you guys do is the same stuff that we do (at least when playing D&amp;D and games with similar formats). I'm not trying to trap you or convince you of anything, or even (God forbid) debate or prove anything. That's just an observation: what happens at your table (as far as I can glean from your write-ups) is the same or close-enough-for-blues to the same as what happens at mine. Could easily be wrong; only way to say for sure is to play together. Maybe when I'm set up for G+ Hangouts we could arrange something sometime.<br><br/>Anyway, back to the general topic, here's a true story from high school:<br/><br/>My guy has a bounty on his head. Matt decides that the money is too good, so tries to take me out. We fight in the street, and he throws me through a window, and I pass out from pain and blood loss. Cops show up and arrest me, and Matt looks like a big damn hero and gets the bounty.<br/><br/>But he doesn't stop there. He says, "When you get to jail, you get raped by your cellmate, Bubba."<br/><br/>"What?"<br/><br/>"You heard me."<br/><br/>Now, there are rules for plausible chance occurrences happening that you want to happen, and they revolve around your character's Luck attribute. As system-guru (and it's creator), I tell him it's gonna take one hell of a Luck roll for that to happen.<br/><br/>Bastard makes the roll.<br/><br/>And, just so no one is confused, we had fun.<br/><br/>So how was that fun? Well, we all trusted each other, and we were all agreed on the procedures we would use to play, and we all had a fucked up sense of humor. It's pretty much as simple as that.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362339/#Comment_362339" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T10:19:38+00:00" title="February 24, 2012 10:19AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2012 10:19AM by Zak S.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            now i get to say the thing where I point out the girls in my own personal group don't really rape each other much and then really hope this doesn't turn into a new exciting rapecentric thread                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362344/#Comment_362344" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T10:24:40+00:00" title="February 24, 2012 10:24AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hehe, didn't really think about that possible outcome, but I suppose I could point out that this was the only time that rape ever came up.

I dont think your game is much like the one Holmes described at all.  His game seems to be the unrestrained power tripping that David talked about earlier.  To me your game looks almost completely different (especially in matters of intent or agenda) with probably a few similarities in terms of proceedure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Figaro" title="Figaro"><img alt="Figaro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Figaro">Figaro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362398/#Comment_362398" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T12:00:27+00:00" title="February 24, 2012 12:00PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>I think it's easy to undercut the possibility of facing consequences for a characters actions by using an excuse like the world just happens to be built in such an anarchic fashion that allows the character to be an asshat and get away with it.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nI am not saying that there are never consequences and I take exception to the idea that it is "an excuse" designed to coddle player "bad behavior" if the circumstances of the fictional setting are not such that they will inexorably "end up alone and dead in short order." If you have a straight out of the slush pile "Barbaric Age of Adventure"  backdrop to your game (which may be entertaining to play in even if the PCs aren't themselves inveterate agents of chaos) most of these kinds of PC actions are inherently dangerous <i>but</i> widespread lawlessness and the ineffectuality and/or corruption of the authorities tend to make long-term additive consequences avoidable or postponable, even if the short term consequences are mortal and real.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, consider the burning down of some guy's bar. You might easily be killed by the bartender and his corhorts, by soldiers guarding the town, by being trapped in the flames, or other mischance. You might be identified and have to leave town or risk arrest and execution. BUT, if you can burn down the tavern without anyone recognizing that you did it, slay anyone who recognized you, or flee the town without being caught, it's not implausible to move on to further banditry somewhere else. It's not GUARANTEED, either - for example, what if unbeknownst to you the tavern owner's mother is a witch and uses her magic to track you down, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have a fantastical, preindustrial setting, mayhem is not necessarily always going to be answered with legal or poetic justice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362422/#Comment_362422" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T13:23:21+00:00" title="February 24, 2012  1:23PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2012 1:25PM by Zak S.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Vernon">@Vernon</a> R<br/>\n<br/>\nWith all due respect, Holmes' is dead and not here and if I can blog about my game every day for years and have a tv show about it and <i><b>still</b></i> not have people grasp very basic things like what edition I use or how to spell my 3-letter-long name or whether my players backstab each other I doubt Holmes can effectively communicate the entirety of his play experience in a short essay aimed at a non-D&amp;D; playing audience in a popular magazine.<br/>\n<br/>\nTherefore I respectfully ask that we do not keep talking about what Holmes' game was or was not like.

I remember our DM constructing an epic quest for all of us in the Dragonlance setting (which only one player was familiar with), and we proceeded to shit all over the setting and cause as much chaos as the evil we were attempting to stop (mostly because we didn't want anything bad to happen to us personally).  When chaos was being rained down on a well-known city, my character (an afflicted kender rogue) decided to split off from the group and start looting.  He managed to get a fair amount before we made off in a ship.  Unfortunately one player (who was playing an evil character with his alignment hidden) decided to use his size to his advantage and take a good portion of my bounty.  Which I stole back later.  Which he re-acquired.  It was kind of a running gag.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, my character's rival had destroyed a caravan I was on in the first few sessions before our PCs knew eachother.  Something about being possessed by an evil spirit and sometimes going all super-saiyan and destroying things?  I can't remember the details.  Now, I as a player knew who it was, but because my character never pieced it together, he was oblivious to the fact that this gruff asshole was actually evil-incarnate traveling with the party.  I must've rolled 20 or so Wisdom checks, and failed all of them miserably.<br>\n<br>\nAt another point the DM let someone play a well-known character in the setting, some elvish noble, and we treated him like we'd treat any commoner.  The character was annoyed as all hell.  The player thought it was hilarious.<br>\n<br>\nSo, I mean, sometimes the whole inter-party rivalry and dickishness could get borderline annoying, but being friends with everyone at the table meant we could read eachother pretty well and we knew what our boundaries were.  If someone seemed to be getting legit annoyed, you backed off.  If people were laughing and going along with it, whatever, just keep the game going in that direction until people got bored with the tangent.  As long as you're not super-attached to your PC, it's all in good fun.  I lost 3 characters in the course of a few months (pretty high for most 3e games I played) and one wizard PC of mine must've lost his spellbook four or five times.  You just kind of rolled with it and made up the fun as you went along without taking the events in the game as a personal attack, whether it's from another player, or from some really bad luck the DM informs you about.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362525/#Comment_362525" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T20:04:57+00:00" title="February 24, 2012  8:04PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2012 8:07PM by Paul_T.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Zak, for bringing this thread to life without talking about rape. Your list of principles is fantastic! The only one I'm not sure about is this one:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zak S</cite>8. Split XP Evenly Between The Whole Group Unless You Want Backstabbing</blockquote>\nHow does that fit into this whole style of play? Are you saying, "Don't do this. It's not part of the game's style," or are you saying, "Here's a switch, flip it purposefully"?<br><br>In other words, do you think that "backstabbing" is not part of this playstyle, or just an optional part? <br><br>If it's optional, how often does it come up in your "pornstars" game? Sometimes? Never?<br><br>How does its absence of presence affect the feel of the game? How does it change the attitude of the players? (For example, I could see some people feeling comfortable about playing if they knew backstabbing was not on the table.)<br><br>This is all making a lot of sense to me, and all the replies in this thread have really helped. It is very much like I remember a lot of my gaming from high school. Except we weren't enjoying it because we really, really wanted to get more out of gaming, and it seemed like the only other tool in our box was horribly railroaded epic novel games.<br><br>Here's a quote from Jeff Rients's blog which kind of sums it all up, to me:\n<blockquote>I've experienced this before.

It started with the release of 4e; I got excited in D&amp;D; again.  (My experiences with 3e were not that good.)  Playing 4e wasn't delivering what I wanted so I hacked it a bit to follow the above list.  (Except 8 and 17, though I've tried to speed up character creation.  And 2, but most of what I see in this list is what makes a creative agenda possible.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing that allowed me to enjoy this was, I think, playing all those Forge-designed games for years and getting that out of my system.

I mean, I'm better an GMing now than I was back then, and the games we use are better designed. Back in high school we used a system that I made which, while functional, was confusing and weird. Lately I've been trying to redesign that specific game from the ground up, with a more cohesive vision (frex: pointy-hatted wizards and tree-hugging rangers out, Helter-Skelters and Snake Eaters in). It's been a load of fun, and I really look forward to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">unleashing</span> releasing it for other people to play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362620">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362620/#Comment_362620" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-25T13:59:27+00:00" title="February 25, 2012  1:59PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Like I said earlier, this is still my main mode of play for games with distinct GM-player roles.<br><br>I think a benefit that hasn't been mentioned yet is how easily a session can be generated from this style of play.
