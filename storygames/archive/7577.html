What is the background of this new indie/narrative gamer?<br/><br/>1) It's a player of "traditional" rpgs that is dissatisfied with them? You can't go wrong with Dogs in the Vineyard. The game is written with this kind of reader in mind, and the book explain very well the differences between DitV and "traditional" rpgs (for this same reason, it isn't the game I would give to a complete newbie. He would have to learn what is a "traditional" rpg before). Even if the player is not excited by the setting, try to convince him to at least try. It' really the best text for this. <br/><br/>If the setting of DitV is really a turn-off, or the players don't want to read the book, and you have to explain the game yourself, it's better to use a game "strange" enough to turn-off his "traditional" habit, that would plague the game instead.  Depending on his taste / creativity (to be able to play a gm-less game, for example) some titles could be Polaris or IAWA, for example (but only if you are sure to be able to explain and play them well)<br/><br/>If you need some "stealth" game, that at first sight seem rather "traditional" and then show rather radical ideas during play (and if you can run them well, because both have subtleties not apparent with a simple reading) you can try Sorcerer or Don't Rest Your Head (I have heard people push Inspectres for this, too, but I never player it). <br/><br/>But really, almost any game can work, if you can run it well and the players buy in the premise. If not, if you have to give them the book and leave them alone, of if you have to learn the game with them... look at DitV, above.<br/><br/>2) If it's complete newbie, the initial buy-in is even more important. Primetime Adventures, if you get a good pitch session, build that buy-in from the ground up, so if you are there to teach them the game and you have 5 sessions for a entire season it's a very good choice.  It's not so good if you don't have the time for it or if you have to give the book to them and let them play by themselves: the book is still rather long for someone not used to rpg manuals and the text is unclear in some examples and rules (how many people for example don't understand that the Producer frame every scene and that every conflict is with producer?). And the people who play it need to be at least familiar with the structure of stories ("issues", "narrative arc"... usually people who watch a lot of telefilms or read a lot have no problem with them, but not everybody do)<br/><br/>If you have to give them the book to read, you need a game really simple and able to "grabbing" their attention (to be played), and there aren't so many of them.  One game really simple, fun and playable in a mixed company is "it's complicated". The rules are really short (maybe even too much: it could have used a little more explanation examples) and it can be played with no preparation in a couple of hours.  If the company is game for something much more dark and personal, "It was a mutual decision" could be the game for them. If instead they don't want all these "relationship issues" and want a quick game of alien massacre, "3:16" should be able to grab their attention (as demonstrated by a lot of threads here...).   And if you want to save money, the Nordic free game "Until we sink" could be what you need.<br/><br/>3) If the newbie is your S.O....  why don't you use "breaking the Ice"? (or, when it will be finished, "the Fisherman's Wife"). Or, if he/she enjoy some S&amp;S adventure, even Trollbabe.<br/><br/>But really, player's buy-in is the most important factor (if the game work, I mean...), so if the players are really, really excited about something, anything at all, it's better to use something that can channel that excitation, even if it would not be the first choice, system-wise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168142/#Comment_168142" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-10T02:51:45+00:00" title="September 10, 2008  2:51AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Meg Baker's <i>A thousand and one nights</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_168149">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dogui" title="Dogui"><img alt="Dogui" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dogui">Dogui</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168149/#Comment_168149" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-10T04:23:35+00:00" title="September 10, 2008  4:23AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Played Trollbabe as first "storygame".

I also tend to think that games where the player is mostly in character with less metagaming are more suitable because they are more immediate.<br/><br/>Although I've been in a game of Poison'd with noob storygamers and they had a great time, I'm not sure they understood what the rules had to do with it except as general justification of their atrocious behaviour. So character generation really got the players in character and in the mood but thereafter the rules weren't as involved. <br/><br/>Of course, that was probably down to the GM.

It was crazy, because you could totally see the light switch being flipped - 'so this is how hippie games are supposed to work!'.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168191/#Comment_168191" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-10T07:41:56+00:00" title="September 10, 2008  7:41AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On a related topic, how is the free/demo version of Inspectres?

I not only had a traditional gamer new to indie games but someone who's closest experience with roleplaying was raiding in World of Warcraft. They took to it like ducks to water. The card mechanics took a few passes to fully get, but since you only engage them once per scene, it's easy to take your time with the process until everyone gets it. Fan mail takes a couple of sessions to really get the hang of, but that's true of even experienced indie gamers.<br/><br/>PTA is awesome for complete newbies, however you want to slice it.<br/><br/>HeroQuest and Spirit of the Century are also excellent 2nd and 3rd place picks, although SotC I'd only use to introduce gamers with traditional RPG experience. I'd stick with PTA or HQ for non-gamers. And HQ only if they are huge genre fiction fans (since that's how I like to play it).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sacredchao" title="sacredchao"><img alt="sacredchao" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sacredchao">sacredchao</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168308/#Comment_168308" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-10T11:41:45+00:00" title="September 10, 2008 11:41AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd say <i>Spirit of the Century</i>.

I think you want something that doesn't focus completely on face stabbing, or hitting ethical dilemmas. This let's them play in a way they're used to and slowly test the waters. Dust Devils and The Mountain Witch have mechanics that will likely push them to center the drama more on each other, but they don't break if folks decide to stick with traditional "we're the group" play. Mortal Coil front loads their investment, and I can't wait to see the expanded version.<br/><br/>I think there are some hidden complexities to Dogs play that may be hard for new folks to puzzle out. "What do you mean I decide how much stuff I have, and how good it is? That will unbalance the game." My very limited experience, is you spend more time trying to explain that the system will indeed work, and how it works.

Somone really ought not be choosing Traits if they don't have the gist of what it means to be a Dog, the types of folks with whom they'll conflict (family, kids), and the nature of Fallout from escalated conflicts (injury, death). The game is about moral choices in the face of a bad list of options; it's not about accumulating kills/wins. If they're not clear on that, they can't put up Flags with their Trait choices (well, can't put up informed-choice Flags). In such a case... sure, of course they'll emphasize whatever their habit of play might be, possibly to the point of being "underpowered".<br/><br/>(I'll set aside the fact that a Dog is rarely "underpowered" unless facing 5d10 of demonic influence, a hyped-up Sorcerer, or a mob--or all three. DitV doesn't really make someone "lose"--it makes someone decide what they, as a player, are willing to do to get what they want... or not, if the moral price is too high.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_168521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168521/#Comment_168521" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-11T13:23:23+00:00" title="September 11, 2008  1:23PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would vote not Primetime Adventure's or Spirit of the Century, They Both have their own conciets that seem to get in the way of the actual game when explaining it to newbs ( I've had a few crash and burns with them ).

We never got a chance to do a second session, but the first seemed to be going fairly well.  The main problem was that I had to remind the two of them a couple times that they didn't need to argue about things like whether someone was pushing too hard, that that is precisely what the system is designed for.  If someone says something you don't like, don't argue about it in out of game language, throw down an appropriate Key Phrase.  They seemed to be catching on pretty well.<br/><br/>I tried a playtest of Serial with a group that included a couple non-gamers about a month ago.  The two non-gamers actually were engaging with the game better than at least one of the two people I regularly game with, but that is apparently primarily because he wasn't into the genre and disliked the mechanics (or lack thereof) in Serial.  But if people like the genre, I think Serial could be an excellent choice.  Clear simple rules, designed to be played in a few hours in one evening.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_168719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168719/#Comment_168719" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-12T13:25:14+00:00" title="September 12, 2008  1:25PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 12, 2008 6:04PM by johnzo.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a long-long-long time traditional gamer, the first story game that really clicked for me was the <a href="http://www.berengad.com/public/beasthunters_demo.pdf" rel="nofollow">Beast Hunters demo.</a>  I think it could be a  great tool to identify people who want more story-ish play from their traditional RPG, and here's why: <br/><br/>The game is about being badass, which I think is a pretty accessible theme for gamers.  "It's like a Conan movie starring the Rock and Vin Diesel" is my pitch, or, alternatively, "it's like that weird Baron Munchausen game, but it's about kicking ass."<br/><br/>It empowers players to set scenes, make up crazy combat moves, and improvise story.  There are little story questions implied in the traits of the demo characters -- who is Arkhya? who is Harik?  Who are my ancestors and what did they teach me?  When I started improvising around those things and hearing "Yes" from the Challenger instead of "Uh, no, that's not how it works" -- that was the click moment for me.<br/><br/>There's a strong gamemaster judging the proceeding arbitrarily, which can be a familiar and comforting thing.  <br/><br/>The Challenger is in a good position to reward story generation.  When I've run the demo, I ramp up rewards when people start referencing stuff that other players have created, because it shows they're listening and engaged and they're running with other people's stuff.  <br/><br/>It encourages players to own the fun of the whole table.  When you're up in BH, you're on the spot to entertain everyone else with a tall tale of ass-kicking.  It's got just the right level of intraparty competition to get the juices really flowing.<br/><br/>The secondary goals change battles from binary win/lose enterprises to something a little more nuanced.  This is especially critical in the full campaign game, when anyone, Hunter or Challenger, can propose a secondary goal.  <br/><br/>For non-gamers?  I don't know.  Maybe Universalis?  Back in the day, I think Harper had a  Universalis night going that had a more party-game / parlor-game kind of vibe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
