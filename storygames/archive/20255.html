AW in particular means a particular season of people playing Apocalypse World in a memory diseased water world.)</i><br/><br/>So to my surprise, I'm seeing way more similarities than I expected.<br/>TG is a traddy game with a bunch of pre-written encounters and a sorta raily structure. But\u2026 looking at Adam generate the fronts, they kind of give off a similar vibe. \u201dI want to make an enclave of mutants\u201d<br/>Both games feature player input into world descriptions (the golden beetle?from TG comes to mind).  In both games, players seem happy.<br/>Both games feature a lot of ability tests. In the case of AW, it's in order to generate 7-9 results to drive the game. In TG, I don't really understand why. We haven't really seen any failure yet except fail forward.<br/>I know that I can't run games like Pramas or Wheaton does it, and kinda not play in them either (I'm too non-linear). That's the biggest difference. But in seeing how similar they are, AW comes across as traddier than I thought.<br/><br/>AW has more choices than TG, it seems. That's what makes PbtA more fun to run and to play than AGE (TG's rules). But when it comes to AW, the playground to make those choices in can sometimes come across as post-hoc and "no-myth" or just a few planned threats. In TG, the playground is like a guided tour, in AW it's "created just a few steps ahead of you".<br/>Wil certainly seems ready to improvise when it comes to details and the same goes for Adam.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446212/#Comment_446212" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-12T17:16:22+00:00" title="July 12, 2015  5:16PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you've got it backwards.

because Wil specifically wants it to happen.<br/>He says if/when to roll.<br/>He describes each roll's consequence in the fiction.<br/>He asks the Players for input here and there.<br/>He already decided what will happen next in the story, and Player's actions only have marginal relevance.<br/><br/>All the more interesting bits (affecting the setting on a triple-match roll, having the Players set-up some interconnected secrets, etc) are NOT part of the Dragon Age system, and I somehow doubt they are part of the AGE system too... they are clever ideas Wil implemented to his game.<br/><br/>In AW things do not work like this... at all :P<br/>I haven't watched the Roll20AW episodes, but I will remedy shortly, is this the correct link?<br/><span class="VideoWrap"><span

front of the MC ideas and preparation.<br/>Dice rolls are not arbitrary, with the MC possibly being the player that devotes most attention to see if the fiction triggers a roll, thus suggesting it to the table.<br/>Fronts and threats have a pre-plotted trajectory (when they have it at all) only in so far as the PCs do nothing... the moment they start to act, all bets are off, and the MC plays to know what happens next just as much as the Players.<br/>Every roll has meaningful consequences because that is how the game works, and the rules offer the specific tools to achieve that... not because the GM is a good one.<br/><br/>I don't know... looks pretty different to me <img alt=":/" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/confused.png" title=":/"/><br/><br/>One thing I also notice in TG... <br/>The mage player has very bad luck with dice.<br/>Thus he keeps failing.<br/>Thus he ended up being the laughing stock of the group, in a pretty humiliating way.<br/>He looks (mostly but not always) ok with it, and laughs along the others.<br/>I personally would not be cool with that... but maybe that's just me :P<br/><br/>In AW this would actually be <b>against the rules</b>.<br/>Obviously Wil is not being (enough) a fan of that character.<br/>And anyway rolling a 1-6 would still have allowed Wil and the Player to describe pretty awesome and successful actions... only then some Hard Move would follow (and maybe impact other PCs, and for unrelated reasons... as a bad roll is NOT necessarily equivalent to a PC-fuckup... you do everything right BUT some other shit happens)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div

From my outside perspective, the mechanics making it a total whiff plus the oft-ignored abstract nature of hit points tended to narration of rather absurd failed results, like a player missing an easy shot at point blank range and inventing an excuse why it missed completely rather than saying something like your example.<br/><br/>I don't know if this was something primarily about the play culture that I observed, or something inherent in the combination of abstract hit points and failed rolls being null results.<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446379/#Comment_446379" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-13T19:50:38+00:00" title="July 13, 2015  7:50PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I also need to add that I don't want to bring down Adam.

Not that is the only way to play, but it definitely curbed some potentially negative neophyte tendencies.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it didn't save me from a later miscommunication in a Diaspora Fate game, where one player called up an NPC radio announcer friend to warn him about a secret and in the heat of the roleplaying accidentally got the call put on the air. There wasn't a roll involved, and maybe there should have been: the player was a little upset that his intent had been subverted without discussion. It worked out OK and they ended up solving the problem via an Elvis-impersonator dubstep concert, but it's still one of my little GMing regrets.<br/><br/>(No disrespect to Wil (or Adam!) intended; just memories of pitfalls I've avoided and fallen into.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446690/#Comment_446690" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-16T06:35:43+00:00" title="July 16, 2015  6:35AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seems like he is using bangs.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446712/#Comment_446712" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-16T15:34:16+00:00" title="July 16, 2015  3:34PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wil or Adam?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446717/#Comment_446717" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-16T15:43:39+00:00" title="July 16, 2015  3:43PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wil.

Even inaction becomes a relevant choice.<br/><br/>"<i>She tears her dress</i>" was kind of just a very specific yes/no choice. Maybe a hard choice, kind of like your average 7-9 in <i>Acting Under Fire</i>, but nothing more than that.<br/><br/>And the "Dead Brother"?<br/>I agree with <a href="/forums/profile/Isaac">@Isaac</a> in considering it more like a way to force the player's hand towards the obvious boss-fight, than anything else.<br/>And, more than anything else, this even actually closed doors: this thing is tied up, you got the answers, you got revenge, let's leave it and move along with the scheduled quest :P                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447692/#Comment_447692" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-07T09:51:55+00:00" title="August  7, 2015  9:51AM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 7, 2015 9:55AM by 2097.">edited August 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Episode 9 spoiler:<br/><br/>The DM is talking SO MUCH. I know he is an audio book narrator and he does amazing job in that regard but... let the players in! This was a "cut scene" episode. I've played with DM's like this and it was terrible. Wake me up when we can <i>do</i> something.<br/>He asks the players one choice each for each scene and then say "You laugh, you do this, you say that, you do this". I don't mean to dogpile and I realize that this isn't an ordinary game night, it's a pretty high stakes show and that this is a legit approach to making that work.<br/><br/>This DM-is-talking-all-the-time isn't something that's directly dependent on the rules system. The competitor show Nimmorgeist has the same problem: even though they're running Dungeon World, the DM is talking way way more than the players combined in the first episode of that show.<br/><br/><br/>Anyway, TitansGrave turns out to have been a massive hit (it was apparently huge at GenCon).

Sometimes Will improvises a detail or object and lets players do the same. Chapters are also different from each other.  \u201dHi, you've reached the grounds of a manor, go explore\u201d vs \u201dOK now listen to me talk to you about your dreams for half an hour\u201d. The players had a lot of input up front, those ideas entered into the process. To Wil's credit, it's very much about the specific characters, their histories and quirks. On the other hand, they had to go to the manor, they've had to do this or that.<br/><br/>Themes like race, ablism, and gender are handled often, explicitly and from a perspective of meaning well. There's been a queerification of bionics and cybertech that's interesting.<br/><br/>The book is out now, so maybe it'll turn out to be less scripted than it looks.<br/>As for the goals, they're ambitious.

Popularizing RPG in general for outsiders (just like with Fiasco, DA or Dread)? Advertizing Wil's precious game idea to roleplayers?<br/>4. Does the setting feel inclusive to you?</blockquote>\n1. It's not really a scripted show, it's just a plain old <b>railroad</b> :P<br/><br/>2. Yes, extremely linear. Will had a very good and deep preparation phase where he brainstorms about stuff with the Players, and of course you can see Player input in all the parts of the game that are meaningless for the preservation of the plot. Other than that, it's your vanilla railroad, that looks good thanks to the complete Partecipationism offered by the players.<br/><br/>3. The goal is marketing. They created a whole game universe, just printed and available to buy. The show is the perfect advertisement.<br/>Also, popularizing RPGs in general is one of the stated goals.<br/><br/>4. As Susan said, yeah, it throws into the game some pretty interesting themes, and they are all played out in a well meaning way <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447944/#Comment_447944" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-12T17:03:04+00:00" title="August 12, 2015  5:03PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Episode 9 was scripted though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447945/#Comment_447945" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-12T17:05:21+00:00" title="August 12, 2015  5:05PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But the script was written after recording the previous 8 episodes so they could write it very character specific.

I couldn't sit through episode 9 because my tolerance for lengthy narration evaporated within about ten minutes and I couldn't stand any more of it, and because the fun part of the show, the part that feels the most similar to an actual game to me, was missing: the players interacting <i>with each other</i>. I wasn't watching the series because I wanted to listen to a long monologue followed by one person picking A or B, I was watching it because four people would be presented with a situation, and then they'd gang up on it. That's always fun, even within the strict borders of a Youtube series.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447960/#Comment_447960" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-13T20:04:16+00:00" title="August 13, 2015  8:04PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'd like to think that at least some of this is driven by the requirements of trying to make an entertaining, limited-length series on Youtube with episodes lasting no longer than one hour at the very most</blockquote>\nPossible.<br/>But... what about the FIASCO episodes?<br/>Totally unscripted and gm-less game that produced an amazing story, professionally edited to last just the time they needed, with all the eye-candy they needed (asides, interviews, rules explanations, etc).<br/><br/>What about MY videos?<br/>They are <b>crap</b>, because I'm totally unskilled both at using Hangouts-on-Air and any form of video editing... but just by cutting away idle chats, moments of technical difficulty and the general sloppiness of human speech (you know when you speak and every few words you go MMMM EEEEHM UUUUUHM) I manage to turn 4h of raw footage into 40-50 minutes of video.<br/><br/>I would expect that professionals would be able to do the same (and a lot better, actually) with whatever Wil and his group do during their game sessions.<br/><br/>No.<br/>I have the feeling that the big reason behind this game structure is much simpler.<br/>Wil is a "<i>good gm</i>" type of player.<br/>He enjoys many forms of rpg, but his favourite is exactly this: storytelling.<br/>He has HIS story in mind and enjoys TELLING it to the players, he enjoys REACTING to their (limited and controlled) input, he enjoys looking at the reactions of his AUDIENCE (the players at the table, not the youtube viewers).<br/><br/>We saw glimpses of this approach both in the Dread and the Dragon Age episodes of TableTop :P<br/><br/>And why not?

I see your point, at any rate, and I agree that I wouldn't really want to play with Wil if what we see on the show is very close to what he'd do in an actual game, any more than I would want to play with the guy who ran Dragon Age for them on that episode of Tabletop.<br/><br/>Still, it's hard to not respond to this with a shrug. I'm very much in the camp that says that the best way (and possibly the only truly effective way) to get people who have never played RPGs interested in playing one is simple:<br/><br/>- Meet a person who has never played an RPG.<br/>- Make friends with them.<br/>- Invite them to play this fun game that is relevant to their interests.<br/><br/>A bunch of Youtube videos about any game, no matter how slickly produced or pretty it might be, isn't going to resemble the actual experience of playing it, and so I'm not convinced that it actually matters all that much in the grand scheme of things. If it's entertaining to watch, great. And if it isn't entertaining, that's too bad. But if it's meant as some kind of commercial for gaming, well, that's going to be remarkably ineffective and very nearly a complete waste of effort, but it's probably harmless. Consequently, if you're actually making a bunch of Youtube videos about a game...well, you should probably stick with "entertaining" as your goal, unless you like inevitable heartbreak. :P

If you know and like someone, you can suggest something they'd be interested in and explain why you think they'd get a kick out of it, and you probably won't be thought of as even less trustworthy than a TV show...or at the very least, your "Actually, it's not much like what you saw on that show" explanation will get a fair hearing. Probably better than fair, because everyone already knows TV's inaccurate.<br/><br/>(And speaking only for myself, I'm not convinced that it's worth worrying about the effect most things have "on the games market." As far as the market is concerned, it doesn't seem to matter if Tabletop or Titansgrave or any other series shows good gaming or bad gaming: as long as they don't show <i>boring</i> gaming, it's working as much as any advertising can be expected to...and like all advertising, how effective it is seems like it'd only matter to people who are selling things. I feel like the rest of us only have to worry about what happens around our own table, and that we're all much more influential and important there than anything a TV show could do.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447973/#Comment_447973" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-14T14:43:18+00:00" title="August 14, 2015  2:43PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's the old \u201dyou're not gonna be a prophet in your hometown" thing.<br/>I've tried it with an old Pong game I thought would be fun at a party, so many board and card games, story games.

I rely on a much more outgoing friend of mine to find people to game with; seriously, without him to keep our gaming group full, I'd probably just do something else with my free time rather than go looking for new blood by myself. (Some of them are people he played with at conventions or game days, and others are just people he met through some other activity, got to know, and then individually pitched on trying out a game that would specifically appeal to them. I don't think he's ever tried pitching a whole group in some other social setting at one shot, though.)<br/><br/>That said, I'm pretty sure no Youtube series is going to be able to do the heavy lifting required to get a group together. I'm not even sure it can make a noticeable difference in that process, except as a conversation starter; you can start with "Hey, you saw that show and liked it?", but you're still going to have to get 'em excited about playing a game with you and help them learn the ropes the same way you would without it. (And on that level, a railroady gaming series is as good as a 'better' one, I'd think.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448009/#Comment_448009" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-17T21:00:47+00:00" title="August 17, 2015  9:00PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, for once, I agree with 2097.

I don't know.)</blockquote>\nYes, exactly;  The RPG community is small because next to no effort is being made by anyone to <b>both</b> A) Create games that can be picked up and played without someone who already knows how to play and <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> Advertise the existence of those games.  Some people are working hard to do A, but a lot of them are indie designers with severely limited ability to do B, and even the 'big names' like WotC and Paizo and FFG aren't really trying very hard to do B.  What we had here was an opportunity for someone with influence to do B, and maybe even use a game that does A and create a confluence of events that might have introduced people to the hobby.  Instead, we did B with a game that requires the traditional "and here's how you play an RPG" handholding from a veteran player.<br/><br/>People don't just magically fall into the boardgame hobby. But boardgames are an order of magnitude more popular than RPGs.  This is due, in no small part, to the fact that you can buy a copy of Settlers of Catan after you read <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-packers-of-catan-green-bays-board-game-obsession-1421346102" rel="nofollow">some dumb article on the internet</a> and you can play it!

Titansgrave and Tabletop aren't charities or public service announcements -- they are commercial products, intended to bring in revenue for Wil Wheaton, Geek &amp; Sundry, etc.. By being successful, they are sending up a flag that says "It is possible to make money by producing shows about playing RPGs," which is what just happened.<br/><br/>Therefore, it is now MUCH more likely that anyone who wants to make a show about playing RPGs will be able to get together the money to do that, because <i>now people know there is money to be made here</i>. It's proof that there's an audience for a show about playing RPGs, and it's proof that having your game on a show about playing RPGs is good for sales. (We can rest assured that if it had flopped, the take-home message would have been "Nobody who wants to make money should ever make a show about playing RPGs," and that would be the end of it for the next few years at least.)<br/><br/>In other words, just by being successful, it's creating an opportunity for other shows to come along that might better suit your desires. It doesn't matter that Titansgrave wasn't the show you wanted: the fact that Titansgrave succeeded rather than flopped just gave the show you DO want a much better chance at being made someday. That ought to give you some consolation, at the very least. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>(And even if Wil Wheaton is the only person in the world who can get an audience to watch a show about playing RPGs -- possible, if unlikely -- you should still have a little bit of hope. Someone could always put the kind of game you want to see played into his hands, or someone could always invite him to play the kind of game you want on another show. He seems like the kind of guy who'd be up for continuing to make money playing games in front of a camera.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448052/#Comment_448052" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-19T06:04:49+00:00" title="August 19, 2015  6:04AM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll add that RollPlay also turns a profit and I think many other rpg shows do, too.

Whether most of those people are already gamers or not I dunno, but there's always anecdotes on the forums about people trying tabletop rpgs for the first time, so...<br/><br/>(To be fair, though, I think Kevin's success with SWN et al is mostly because of a savvy business plan, and less because of RollPlay.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448074/#Comment_448074" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-19T20:22:43+00:00" title="August 19, 2015  8:22PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            608                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448078">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448078/#Comment_448078" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-19T22:13:45+00:00" title="August 19, 2015 10:13PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 19, 2015 11:04PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited August 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Right; So, I guess what I'm saying is "We've successfully set up the format for RPG shows to be a format that doesn't do a good job growing the hobby".</blockquote>\nFair enough; I think the only real difference between our opinions is that I don't think there <i>is</i> a way for a Youtube series (or conventional TV show, or movie, or podcast, or ...) to 'do a good job growing the hobby' no matter what the format is, at least not at the scale you suggest is possible. (I figure any show that's entertaining and can serve as even a vague point of familiarity when asking someone if they want to come play a game with you is about the very best anyone can hope for there. But I'm also in favor of anything that increases the number and variety of entertaining shows in this world, so I'm glad that this seems to be becoming a thing and I hope shows like the ones you want get made, even if I don't think it's going to be what makes the hobby 'grow.')                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C.Jay" title="C.Jay"><img alt="C.Jay" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C.Jay">C.Jay</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448084/#Comment_448084" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-20T03:49:51+00:00" title="August 20, 2015  3:49AM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't watched titansgrave (loved roll20 AW), but it seems a bit unfair to pin our hopes on "growing the hobby" on Mr Weaton.

The Fiasco episode alone pretty much proves that.  If a bunch of boardgamers didn't buy that game after that episode, I will eat my hat.  Am I "pinning my hopes"?

I'm not saying that it will magically turn it into a mainstream hobby or something, that would be stupid, but at the same time, I think that without advertising, you are looking at a slowly dwindling hobby.  Of course, <a href="http://www.polygon.com/2015/8/20/9172559/dungeons-dragons-dnd-4th-edition-one-year-later-twitch-youtube" rel="nofollow">a recent article I read about D&amp;D 5E</a> might be proving me wrong there, though hell if I know how 5E is reaching any new players.... except by apparently having a serious STREAMING presence.

The adventure it describes is <i>exactly the same</i> as the one presented in the TitansGrave show. One video reviewer even avoided reading parts of the book because they wanted to avoid spoilers for the show. And who would want to run or play this adventure after watching the show, especially since there are MAJOR spoilers at the end? I can see how it might be entertaining to read, but not how it might be useful as an RPG product.<br/><br/>On the other hand perhaps this is just the most accessible and effective method of entry to the hobby, and players will seek new RPGs as they become more aware of what they find fun about them. This makes sense to me as I find many of the more 'refined' RPGs I prefer take more <i>discipline</i> to run and play. In which case I'm worrying about nonsense again, and should instead be working to make those other RPGs more accessible somehow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454373/#Comment_454373" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-30T11:29:33+00:00" title="June 30, 2016 11:29AM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I never got through the entirety of Roll20 AW. (Or I haven't yet.) I've started most of Adam's series on there but I never seem to finish watching them. I'm all caught up on Office Hours and on Being Everything Else and Hack Attack, and I'm <i>almost</i> up to date with Swan Song. I just started episode 36 and I think there are just over 40. My favorite is almost The West Marches (even though they yanked the name from one of the posters here on S-G, Ben Robbins) and even though I've only seen like a handful. But it's so similar to the way I want to run things.<br/><br/>I started watching TitansGrave again (I saw every episode last summer) because they're posting their behind-the-scenes episodes in anticipation of the new season.<br/>When I watch Adam's games (and I now know that he has an account on here), and that goes for Steven and even like Matthew Mercer, too, I'm like: "Yup. They're playing the games" -- it's all in a tradition I'm familiar with whether it's hyper-prepped like The West Marches or B2, or it's low-myth like AW or BW, or a mix like (Adam's take on) SWN. They are streaming their games like any other let's play show, and talking about their games. And it's great and it's within genre and it's pretty much replaced normal television for me.<br/><br/>But when I see TitansGrave, it's heartbreaking. What I love:<br/>\u2022 They are so serious, they're in character most of the time<br/>\u2022 Everyone really, really cares about it<br/>\u2022 The art is great, there's music, sound effects, they built a big set in a studio...<br/>\u2022 Seriously, the sound production, their mikes etc. On RollPlay/Roll20/CritRole, there's crappy mic over skype which makes it tiring for the ears, all the noise. Here, it's a dream to listen to.<br/>\u2022 Wil's narration is great, it really shows that he cares.<br/><br/>What breaks my heart?<br/>It's so much all of my prejudice against trad come to life, come to more life than I thought possible. In the first episode, everything's going great, Wil's great, the player's are great, and then there's gonna be like a story-telling contest at the club the characters are at. And Wil asks them all to roll to see if they know what this contest is about. And all four of them flub their rolls (this is very unlikely) and he is distraught and then he tells them that they know anyway.<br/><br/>The roll became meaningless. Now, these sorta mistakes happen. I can't expect perfect play. I shut the episode off then and there. Then tried again a few hours later, resuming from where I was. And again something similar happened.<br/><br/>It's from so much a different tradition of what an RPG even <em>is</em> than I'm used to that makes it hard to watch, that makes me go "no, stop, that's not how you... uh..."<br/>But that doesn't mean I'm right and they're wrong. They had fun around the table. A large part of the audience loved it. It was a hit.<br/><br/>I just don't <em>get</em> it because <a href="http://big-model.info/wiki/Creative_Agenda" rel="nofollow">it's like the old 'we love pigs'</a> thing. We who love pigs, we saw wow, this beautiful production, these amazing players, this is going to be awesome!<br/>And then they started butchering the pigs and putting them on sandwiches and nom nom nom and we were like nooooooo!!! How could you!!!!<br/><br/>And. They also love pigs. I'm not saying they're not talented sandwich eaters or what have you. They are, for sure. They did a very very good job at what they set out to do.<br/>Heartbreaking for us                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454503/#Comment_454503" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-02T11:07:40+00:00" title="July  2, 2016 11:07AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've not yet seen the Roll20 indie sessions, but I've seen TitansGrave and let me tell you this:<br/><br/>\u2022 They are so serious, they're in character most of the time<br/><br/>No, they have good post-game editing.<br/>Most of the online play I have seen has little to no post-production. Correct me if I'm wrong in the case of the Roll20 shows you mentioned, but usually you get 3-4 hours of almost raw in-game footage. Which is awesome as analysis material, but not so good as show entertainment.<br/><br/>\u2022 Everyone really, really cares about it<br/><br/>Yes, they are paid for that.<br/>AND they are acting.<br/>I'm sure they are playing for real, and also having fun doing it (most of the time... there are some pretty obvious "player is not having fun" moments here and there) but they are also producing a professional show, cutting and pasting and re-shooting scenes, jokes, commentary.<br/>It's a professionally produced thing, not a spontaneous "let's play &amp; record it" thing.<br/><br/>\u2022 The art is great, there's music, sound effects, they built a big set in a studio...<br/>\u2022 Seriously, the sound production, their mikes etc. On RollPlay/Roll20/CritRole, there's crappy mic over skype which makes it tiring for the ears, all the noise.

I've had so many discussions online with people telling me that my ideas of "trad gaming" are wrong, and that no one plays like that - and I was almost convinced. But here, exactly, is something that looks like the gaming I remember. If RPGs never got better than that, I would have quit long ago. <br/><br/>Very disappointing, indeed. But the show is incredibly well produced and put together, and its success is fun to see. However, I would never want to play in this game.<br/><br/>I'd love to see the Misspent Youth episode, as I loved the Fiasco episode (and feel like I could play the game very well, having seen it - it serves as an excellent model for people trying to learn the game).
