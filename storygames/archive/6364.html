This kind of environmental advantage can be captured with a special Particular Strength, awarded by the GM.<br/><br/>Pick a d12 with an interesting color, that's the World.<br/><br/>The world is unique, so only one character can have it at a time. The World can be used with any forms.  <br/><br/>The GM can award or take away the World from any character at any time EXCEPT during an action sequence where it's being rolled.  <br/><br/>Note that, like any Particular Strength, using the World makes your character less likely to go on the Owe List. Also, only one die for a Particular Strength can be used at a time, so it cannot be combined with a Particular Strength. You can still describe actions in terms of a Particular Strength employed, but you won't roll the dice for it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce" title="Dave Younce"><img alt="Dave Younce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g232/thomastamblyn/Avatars/GoPlayDice.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce">Dave Younce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140890/#Comment_140890" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-23T03:05:52+00:00" title="April 23, 2008  3:05AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can you give an example of how this rule has been used in play and tell a little more about why you instituted it?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140987/#Comment_140987" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-23T16:11:19+00:00" title="April 23, 2008  4:11PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here, here.

If I prepare really well for a battle, I'm using my forms.  If I suck at that preparation, I'm using my forms.  <br/><br/>The World is supposed to give that well-positioned or well-prepared character an edge, and emphasize the environment.  That (I hope) will help encourage things like "I run up the temple steps, using height as an advantage" which flesh out the scenery around the characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141039/#Comment_141039" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-24T05:37:56+00:00" title="April 24, 2008  5:37AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good luck and I look forward to hearing how this works out.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we tend to do in IAWA is have the dice rolls indicate to us how well our character used elements such as the environment to their advantage and then we fill in the blanks with the narration. If I roll poorly, depending on the character, I don't imagine my character looking like a fool tripping over himself. Instead I try to imagine what else could have gone wrong, environmentally, distractions, selling old injuries and so on and then justify the bad roll by fleshing out the scenery.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, the dice in IAWA are all about inspiring improv and tension. So I'd love to hear how these changes affect the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141107/#Comment_141107" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-24T10:47:25+00:00" title="April 24, 2008 10:47AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            d12 seems awfully high.
