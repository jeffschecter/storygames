There's a thread collecting special moves on Barf Forth Apocalyptica, but it's not really for discussion (makes it hard to browse moves). So I thought I'd post here to talk about sweet-ass moves that you come with that also need a little discussion. So please discuss moves here!<br/><br/>Here's mine:<br/><br/><b>When you enter the Slave Pits</b> roll+hot:<br/>On a 10+ you are immediately noticed, isolated and ambushed.<br/>On a 7-9 you are approached and persuaded to sell your body into "indentured servitude"<br/>On a miss you avoid attention entirely (hotties: tell us how!).<br/><br/>I like it because it's like the Harm move: you don't want to hit this one! Can we discuss this it a bit? Do you think it's unfair to penalize people with good scores? I think this is all win, because even if you "fail", you get spotlight time and an interested thing happens to you!<br/><br/>(cross-posted on apocalypse-world.com/forums)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290081/#Comment_290081" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T16:19:53+00:00" title="August 30, 2010  4:19PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh man, I wish I had my fronts sheets with me.<br/><br/>Here's one, from memory.<br/><br/><b>When you harm one of the Frenzied...</b>, roll+harm done<br/>On a 10+ The Frenzy is your own.

That makes a lot of sense.<br/><br/>I wasn't trying to imply that Hot just meant you were pretty, but I did discount the control aspect. Confidence and control are big parts of being 'attractive', huh?<br/><br/>Thanks for the tip!<br/><br/>Edit: Actually, I don't think the inverse move makes any sense. Assuming that hotness isn't skin-deep (heh), why would people with low Hot get noticed at all? Is there any way to salvage the move so it makes sense?<br/><br/>The context of the move is important, I think: the Slave Pits are in the ruins of a dense urban area (an overworld dungeon, if you will). In this environment Hot doesn't have much salience--even the Skinner, should he find himself in these slums, wouldn't really be thinking about his appearance too much. I was going for an in-the-moment thing--what people think of at first glance.<br/><br/>I think in that context, if you're attractive you can't really hide it. You hold yourself a certain way, you say certain things, you do certain things. Even a scarred up thug will be noticed for his posture and movements, etc.<br/><br/>I think what I'll do is only unload this move when it seems relevant. If someone is Hotting their way around the Pits, for example. Or if fictional circumstances dictate that it makes sense. Perhaps as a sub-move direct attached to the seduction/manipulation moves? "Hey, he thinks you're so pretty that he gets some friends together and tries to enslave you!"<br/><br/>Maybe that too would be better captured by a hard move on a failed Hot roll.

It's also not nearly as much of a "penalty" in my game.  It goes something like this (posting from memory):<br/><b>When you enter Isle's place...</b><br/>Roll+hot.  On a 10+ you catch Isle's attention.  On a 7-9 you catch the attention of one of Isle's boys or girls.<br/><br/>Isle would be a skinner if she was a PC.  She runs the only real bar/club type place in the holding.  So yeah, it was based on the assumption that a high hot means the character is impressive in some potentially obvious way.  But it just means the PC is more likely to draw the attention of someone who might make his or her life "interesting."<br/><br/>I have a couple other custom moves that make it more likely that something "interesting" happens to someone, without any conscious choice/action on their part, if they have a high stat.  I think the others are based on weird. In particular, if weird people in my game listen to the Maw (a big f-ing crack in the ground) they're more likely to gain strange insights into their problems, but also become addicted to listening to it, and fall under its thrall.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_290322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290322/#Comment_290322" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T07:35:56+00:00" title="August 31, 2010  7:35AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A few custom moves from our play-test game:<br/><br/><b>Banging the Gong</b><br/>When someone takes the drug, roll +Cool. <br/><br/> On a 10+ treat it as a full hit for Opening Your Brain, with the MC giving information about a current, relevant situation and asking a question.

The intent is to put it between what would heal or worsen on it's own.  I have no idea whether it's kosher to skip segments of Harm, but I think it makes sense- being sick makes you more fragile, more likely to suffer from a wound that should heal normally.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite>That's interesting, since the current rules say that seizing by force pretty much needs to involve FORCE</blockquote>\nYeah, I'm no evangelist about the text, but I think this meets the spirit of the rules for Seize by Force- the character wants something and both sides of the conflict are ready to do harm over it.  In any case, it's a custom move, so you could always detail the specifics without actually calling it Seize by Force if that works better for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290349/#Comment_290349" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T08:31:11+00:00" title="August 31, 2010  8:31AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Steve Segedy</cite>You're right, my mistake.

If you had one segment filled, or took one harm after getting sick, some bruises or whatever that should get better on their own in a few days won't.  And it does that without needing to add a rule saying, "You don't heal naturally while you're sick."  AFAIK, there isn't anything in the rules that say you CAN'T skip segments... it just always talks about it with the assumption that you're moving forward or back around the circle.  Either way, it's a cool way to do something with disease.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Steve Segedy</cite>I think this meets the spirit of the rules for Seize by Force- the character wants something and both sides of the conflict are ready to do harm over it.

I was mostly just wondering if there was a difference in how much Seize by Force was supposed to be about hitting and shooting people when you were playtesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
