If I was to do it again, I'd probably also incorporate a lot of the other techniques I've learned about "structured freeform"-style play and design since then, but unfortunately I don't have all that stuff written down somewhere that's easy to peruse.  I keep meaning to blog about it or start a podcast for discussing it, but I have a couple other things on my plate right now.<br><br/>If you check out the <a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/category/exalted-hack/" rel="nofollow">Exalted hack category</a> on my blog, it has all the stuff I've posted about the hack, but there unfortunately isn't a full ruleset written out, just an assortment of notes.

The mechanics of Exalted are atrocious, especially in comparison to how streamlined the nWoD corebook is.  I mean, in each of the nWoD supplements, they seem really, really into tacking subsystem after subsystem onto the elegant core, which upsets me, but I know that WW is capable of elegant work.  The move from EX1 to EX2 saw some streamlining, but also a lot more bloat (social combat?) while also robbed the setting of its excitement, leaving only lengthy descriptions of various places.  I don't think most folks at WW realize that all the conversations that get started on their forums about rules interactions -- which they take as demonstrating excitement about their game -- mean that lots of people are trying to play their game <i>but are being frustrated because the system is impeding them instead of supporting them</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191861">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191861/#Comment_191861" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-10T09:54:42+00:00" title="February 10, 2009  9:54AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes and yes.

Jeez, never again.<br><br>I'm with you in disliking subsystem creep--your echo chamber theory about why WW invests in such artery-clogging mechanics makes huge sense.  Hadn't thought of that.  You'd think they would catch a clue from the huge number of attempts to port Exalted to *anything* else, homebrew or commercial.  For me, the turnoff is the excessive handling time that comes with Charm bloat, both as a player and a GM.  Virtually anytime a character invokes anything more complex than a simple Charm, it feels like I'm being forced into referencing two or three subsystems.  Instead of a lightning-fast display of superhuman prowess in the fictional narrative, you're mired in huge dice pools, Essence accounting, effect indexing, and paperwork.  Reminds me a lot of d20, but with more nitpickery.  Plus, to my surprise, the whiff factor remained pretty high, even when rolling monstrous numbers of dice (30+).                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191869/#Comment_191869" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-10T10:20:51+00:00" title="February 10, 2009 10:20AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Indeed.

There are even relatively elegant ways to drop massive numbers of dice on the table at once, if that's your thing.

We discovered over time that the onslaught of narrative detail was cool, but failed to generate the kind of suspense and tension we were looking for.  Eventually, my players just wanted to jump straight to the rolls without detailing in order to see how they did.  They had come to see the requirement of supplying details as onerous task rather than joyful embellishment.  The process eclipsed the result, you might say, but emergent story details and character growth hinged more on the outcome of contests than in the storm of details, which really didn't do much to highlight character-significant choices.  To be fair, I don't think Wushu was ever intended to support long-term continuous campaign play.  For short-term games or one-offs, I think it rocks.<br><br>I have <i>Mist-Robed Gate,</i> but hadn't considered it for Exalted.  My group prefers long-term play, so I've been searching for an Exalted port that supports that preference within a less burdensome set of mechanics.  I've developed an unholy fascination with comparing how all these different designs grapple with the setting's parameters.<br><br/><i>Edited to answer the last poster:  Setting details are sprayed through all the books.  A lot depends on what splat interests you the most.  I was always intrigued by the Dragon-Blooded and the Dynasty, because I wanted a "Lantern Bearers"  style of game with political maneuvering, duels, and hidden conspiracies, so I have the books that detail the Terrestrial Exalted, their culture, and the Blessed Isle.  The first edition D-B book is OK.  The Blessed Isle book that came out a couple of years ago is quite good IMHO.  Conversely, the Sidereal book offers this amazing gonzo look at playing amid Heaven, Gods, and Fate.

And if you're playing a FATE-derived game, Aspects are the bomb.  Aspects basically became tiebreakers rather than story and character drivers.  If I were doing it again, I'd strip out my Charm rules, go completely with Aspects, and make Charms either pure narrative detail or work as Aspect-related effects under the stuntless rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191987/#Comment_191987" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-10T17:04:55+00:00" title="February 10, 2009  5:04PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 10, 2009 5:10PM by shreyas.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Books I like, for setting (all 1e, I haven't read the 2ed stuff past the core, which was suffocatingly dry):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dragonblooded (really likely to come up in any game)</li>\n<li>Fair Folk</li>\n<li>Games of Divinity (unfortunately v hard to find)</li>\n<li>Time of Tumult (the part about ancient sun-worshipping dinosaurs anyways)</li>\n<li>Abyssals (the ritual-based culture of ghosts rocks)</li>\n<li>Outcastes (lost eggs is good, forest witches is great Borgstrom weirdness, mecha-japan is kinda dumb)</li>\n<li>Scavenger Sons (just a good overview, lots of paragraph-long ideas ripe for development)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>edit:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Actually, basically everything <strong>in</strong> Abyssals that's not <strong>about</strong> Abyssal Exalted is quite good.</li>\n<li>Sidereals <em>contains</em> setting stuff but it's kind of dull mostly.</li>\n<li>Lunars also contains setting stuff but it's pretty racist and terrible.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_192109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192109/#Comment_192109" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-11T11:11:36+00:00" title="February 11, 2009 11:11AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 11, 2009 11:22AM by Daniel H..">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In going back to the Exalted First Edition core book recently, I was surprised by how little setting information it contains, which is weird as that was the book that got me into the game initially (although I think it was before any of the supplements were printed).<br/><br/>To mention a few things not on Shreyas's list:<br/><br/>*I like the Dreams of the First Age sections in the Solar caste-books.

The real key is the way<br/>\nconflicts ebb and flow and sometimes abruptly jump between types of<br/>\nconflict, always managed by how much impact you're looking to<br/>\naccumulate or avoid. I don't see any reason you couldn't run a<br/>\nnested Covenant setting where the cuts go between Jade Empire<br/>\nfactions, up to conflict between the Jades and the Sidereals, and<br/>\nall the way up to sheer Solar versus Abyssal conflagration with PCs<br/>\non both sides.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
