If someone proposed a 5-session PTA or Smallville or whatever game where the concept was, "You are vampires. And you run a bakery." I'd totally be all in. I mean, the game wouldn't be 100% serious WoD-style play, but at least I would make it as serious and interesting as an interaction between, say, Pushing Daisies and True Blood (leaning towards the True Blood side). <br/><br/>There's something about a juxtaposition about something really cool and something really mundane that does it for me. Not a "I will play this game and nothing else for a year", but at the same time not "Yeah, this will be a one-shot laugh and then over" either.<br/><br/>I have actually run a game called "The Gardeners of Dune", where the players were gardeners for the Harkonnen during the Dune series Harkonnen-Atreides power shift. Big, awesome universe filled with Gom Jabbars and Mentats and Fremen Ninga, and you five are gardeners, and must GARDEN HARD FOR THE EMPIRE. It was, in fact, a one shot at a local con a few years back, but the session was filled before the convention even began (I used BESM as the rules-set). Sure there were some awesome fights and stuff, but still the concept was "awesome world, but you are mundane". Opposite of "normal mundane world, but you are awesome" like the Vampire Bakers idea, but I think the overlap is 100%.<br/><br/>Anyone else like this? Anyone have any ideas for a series of their own?<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_292015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292015/#Comment_292015" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-07T11:51:34+00:00" title="September  7, 2010 11:51AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How can I fail to like this:<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>GARDEN HARD FOR THE EMPIRE</blockquote>LoL!<br/><br/>An idea:<br/><br/>You work in a garage, under a filthy and lazy garage-owner, fixing cars of all sorts, dealing with their impatient owners ...<br/>- and that's a cover for your despicable alien nature, which you hide, being pathetic refugees from a strange planet that got blasted to pieces.<br/>- and you really hope the race that blasted your home planet is not on its way here ...<br/><br/>Another one:<br/><br/>You are werewolves, working in your own coffee-shop, trying hard to earn an income, and to oppress your animal nature.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_292019">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292019/#Comment_292019" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-07T11:58:33+00:00" title="September  7, 2010 11:58AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We had a PTA one-shot that focused on various supernatural weirdos working at Chubby and Tubby's, a sketchy hardware store in White Center, West Seattle.

Some day I'll run that one once I find a system for it.<br/><br/>I did run a two-part Dread game where the player characters were a family living in the Midwest in the early 1950s who woke up one morning to find that they were vampires. Everything was kept to a mundane, survival level with just the right amount of creepy. How were they going to survive? Were they going to have to take Billy out of school before he got to quarterback at the big game? Young Sally had to step up to be the provider by luring neighborhood children into the woods at night.They were hounded by a lone door-to-door bible salesman who managed to kill one of them by whispering a psalm to them.
