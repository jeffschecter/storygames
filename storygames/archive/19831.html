I pitched an A-Team style group in a Pirates of the Caribbean style setting. The players liked being fugitive do-gooders, but didn't really want to line up characters 1 for 1 with Face, Hannibal, BA, and Murdoc. The weird / supernatural from Pirates is fair game, and initially the tone was cheesy 80's with swordfights where nobody actually bleeds. Everybody wanted a new world setting, but there was some discussion about being in a fixed place vs. sailing around. The compromise for the pilot was setting in New Orleans, but the protagonists have a ship (in case we want to be more island of the week later). I find New Orleans while under nominal Spanish rule really interesting for all the power vacuums and institutions on cruise control.<br/><br/>All characters were jailed by the East India Company, and escaped together at some point in the past. We left the origin stories to detail through flashbacks as needed. Group includes Sneed the scoundrel / con man, Bob the mad scientist, Luna the witch doctor, and Sean the sea captain. Sneed's Edges are con man and escape artist, and his connection is his conscience as a personified NPC. He has no set or nemesis, and his issue is that he's living as an opportunist coward but deep down wants to be moral / heroic. So far, the conscience seems like a 3rd edge more than a connection but I didn't see the problem until we got pretty far into play. Bob I can't remember the exact edges, but he's a really smart absent minded guy. His connection is a former pupil who is now successful and renowned in the scientific community. His issue is that he craves recognition of his genius. (he seems like a potential master in a My Life with Master game, but that's neither here nor there.) Bob has a lab on the ship with anachronistic tech (Jacob's ladder, theremin) and biological specimens to gross people out. Luna is described as being played by Grace Jones - she is a voodoo witch doctor and the groups closest BA analogue in being tough and good at violence. She had a potions and charms shop in New Orleans that was burned out by Inigo of the East India Company. He is her nemesis, the burned out space is her personal set, and her grandmother's ghost (died in the fire) is her connection. Sean sailed for the East India Company, but started scamming and stealing from them. Inigo was onto him, and ended up torching a vessel Sean was responsible for. That vessel was carrying slaves, and some did die in the fire.... At this point I pointed out that A) that changes the tone drastically, moving it out of afternoon reruns on cable / broadcast to HBO original territory, and <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> being involved in slave trade and partly responsible for slaves burning to death undermines the character's ability to be sympathetic to an audience. Nobody seemed to have a problem with the tone shift, so I rolled with it.<br/><br/>I was really surprised how long agreeing on a show and creating characters took. We have a 4 hour block for gaming, and we were a little over 2 hours in before I framed the first scene. Only I had tried to run it before, and that was many years ago when I first discovered indie games (that didn't go well - too much baggage from D&amp;D and White Wolf back then), and only the Sean player had read and tried to understand the game ahead of time, which might be part of the problem.<br/><br/>Scenes / story and the clogged fan mail plumbing still to come when I have time....                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
