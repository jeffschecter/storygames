It was INSANE! Like, crackhead insane! It equaled and exceeded my expectations for leaving everyone breathless with laughter!<br/><br/>It was a oneshot for a group of players who were all meeting for the first time (two men and two women) and fortunately everyone was into the concept and the genre and really, really ran with it.We all decided to keep it rated PG-13 and despite some of the gutter level humor and innuendo, never had anything that squicked anyone out. <br/><br/>Chargen was quick and set the tone - once people started rolling stuff up everyone knew what kind of nutso game it was going to be. For the scenario, I used the Favor Race idea, coupled with getting through the daily schedule at the mansion. I decided it would be the day after the Master's birthday, so the house was littered with presents in every room (which could be opened by anyone for a roll on the extensive random items tables). So other than the various tasks on the schedule (make breakfast, clean up, etc) there was no scenario - I decided to allow the game to be entirely driven by the characters and what became judicious use of random events.<br/><br/>There is no way I could relate what happened in the game in sequence. Once it got started and the random events started going off and presents opened, it all just blew up! Some highlights I remember:<br/><br/>* The Master changing from a man to woman (because he accidentally was served the Milk of Fertility by one of the maids).<br/>* One of the maids was actually a man - this coupled with the above led to all kinds of madness!<br/>* All of the maids messing with each other in an effort to curry favor with the Master - lots of "accidental" trips, nasty glares, mops in the face, etc.<br/>* The sex-changed Master being disguised as a man through the application of Ace bandages (wrapped tight) and a rolled up pair of socks...<br/>* More double entendres, over-the-top slapstick, and crazed action than I can describe - I laughed so hard my face was sore afterwards.<br/>* Whacko magical maid powers<br/><br/>For me, it was a real GMing workout. Every time one of the players initiated a random event, I had to figure out how to work it into the action. More than once when I looked up the results of an event roll, I was like "What the hell?!" The players said the look on my face was priceless. A couple of times I just had to shake my head and roll with it. It was all off the cuff and totally seat-of-the-pants, and really fun!<br/><br/>I'll be looking forward to running this again!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179624/#Comment_179624" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-21T05:35:58+00:00" title="November 21, 2008  5:35AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Glad you enjoyed it. <img alt=":3" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/blush.png" title=":3"/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Montesa</cite>It was a oneshot for a group of players who were all meeting for the first time (two men and two women) and fortunately everyone was into the concept and the genre and really, really ran with it.We all decided to keep it rated PG-13 and despite some of the gutter level humor and innuendo, never had anything that squicked anyone out.</blockquote>\nAndy and I were talking yesterday, and we realized that the game never really becomes as squicky as its detractors imagine it must be, even when it gets played by the 4chan crowd online.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179628/#Comment_179628" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-21T06:47:59+00:00" title="November 21, 2008  6:47AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds awesome!<br/><br/>Quick Q: How did the Favor Race end up going down?

I think in actual play, you simply find your groups acceptable comfort level with the risque material.<br/><br/>Andy: The favor race worked very well I thought. Often two maids were competing for favor. In the end, the winner had racked up something like 40 points. I gave out Favor when I felt the master was pleased with something the maids did - if he had the occasion to say "Thank you" or the maids did more than just their job, they got points.<br/><br/>Tony: Leonidas as Master/ BWAHAHAHA!<br/><br/>Graham: I don't think you need too much Japanese genre background, though it most definitely helps. But I tend to not see this problem since I have a lot of exposure to the genre (and the people at my table last night all some experience with it to one extent or another) and Japanese culture in general. That said I do think you could spin it into some other form of slapstick, as long everyone knew it and was familiar with how slapstick in that particular form worked. I dunno, I could be wrong - maybe Ewen or Andy can chime in here on this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179695">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179695/#Comment_179695" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-21T12:10:48+00:00" title="November 21, 2008 12:10PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Part of the issue with the game's accessibility is the thing that otaku culture, as a geek culture, depends a lot on references, and embedded in all the tables are references to stuff that went beyond even my level of knowledge. If you roll up a Plugsuit on the costume change table, or you roll that the Fist of the North Star shows up on the Post-Apocalyptic random event table, some people might wind up scratching their heads a bit.<br/><br/>I don't think it would be too much of a problem to play the game, especially if you stick more to the basic rules. You can always work in your own references to whatever you do know. (Just ask Leonidas). Although my friends are all into anime, relatively few of them have actually seen much of anything in the genre proper[*], but it's mostly turned out just fine. You might might want to get people to watch/read some of, say, He Is My Master or Hayate the Combat Butler to better get in the mood.<br/><br/>At least, that's what I hope. When it comes to otaku stuff, my perspective is kind of warped these days. Hardcore otaku will probably get the very most out of Maid RPG, but hopefully everyone can get something out of it.<br/><br/>Filip,<br/>To me, Maid RPG is more of a slapstick game that has the potential to be pretty serious if you choose to make it that way (and some of the scenarios and replays show how to do this, in some cases in mid-stream). We got the designer to write a bit about creating the game and his intentions, and he said he wanted a game where the character had "romantic appeal," and then went on to basically say, "Just go do whatever you want with it."<br/><br/>[*]There was the same thing when I playtested my Raspberry Heaven game. A bunch of my friends have barely watched any Azumanga Daioh.

What I truly expect was "Tales from the Floating Vagabond" to the nth degree...<br/>\n<br/>\nI am so glad I was totally wrong!  I cannot imagine that there are people who can read over the basic rules, put it to work, and not get some really fun and funny play out of it.  The game is a absolute and total delight and I actually got to the end of looking it over and said "I need some more tables".  Those who know me know that the tables in the this book had to be something special (so special, I had previously thought that only "Doc" Cross and S. John Ross could write such tables).<br/>\n<br/>\nAdd to that the random elements system that reminds me of the curse system in "Dork Tower" (which is abused to great fun by my gaming pals).  The game is and absolute delight and I intend to play this game at a pal's up coming Bachelor Party - so geek it hurts!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179787">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa" title="Mike Montesa"><img alt="Mike Montesa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2395/2470886071_32bd4c6f2f.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa">Mike Montesa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179787/#Comment_179787" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-22T15:37:16+00:00" title="November 22, 2008  3:37PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I think once we made a couple of rolls, I didn't need to look up anything except whatever whacko random event or item we were using next.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179789/#Comment_179789" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-22T15:39:22+00:00" title="November 22, 2008  3:39PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Posted By: Neko Ewen: "A bunch of my friends have barely watched any Azumanga Daioh."<br/>\n<br/>\nFriends don't let friends not watch Azumanga Daioh.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
