Feel free to answer about your own experiences, or comment on mine, or do whatever you want with it).<br/><br/>A few people have commented lately that I seem to be very productive these days. Which is true! It depends how you look at it, of course.<br/><br/>You can work at game design several days a week, and publish one game in three years (which was pretty much what happened with Draug, my first "real" publication). Or you can do the same amount of work and publish games weekly (which is pretty much what's going on with me these days). The games will be very different, and have very different strength and limitations.<br/><br/>Still, though, yes, a lot happening these last months. Here are a few factors affecting that.<br/><br/>1. Stability. Having a stable job situation, family situation, etc, means creativity has lots of free space in my mind. For me, it doesn't seem like the Suffering Artist thing works very well. Of course, being fairly happy means I'm probably not going to be the next Kafka, but who the hell wants to live like Kafka... <br/><br/>2. Spring and summer, hooray!<br/><br/>3. Iterative design. Instead of sitting on a design until it's Done, trying to figure it all out in my head, I'm throwing out playtest documents as fast as I can. Society of Dreamers went from idea to first document in less than 24 hours, playtested and revised several times in the months after that. What's left are the pieces that survived this Darwinistic approach: What works, what makes the game fun and strange, stays, everything else goes. (Draug? I worked for months on the systems, but hardly got them playtested.)<br/><br/>4. Short-form games. They don't take long to write down, and it's easy to get playtesters. Some games can be played right off the bat - from idea to playtest, the only limiting factor is whether there are people around me right there. I thought up a game called HELP I'M A CLONE while walking to the train taking me to Arcon, and played it a few hours after once I'd arrived. (It was lots of fun, and I would have entered it into Little Game Chef, but I didn't use the ingredients. Maybe it'll appear on N\xf8rwegian Style).<br/><br/>5. It's easy to get people to playtest with locally, because there are a lot of people (many of them designers) interested in new games. This wasn't always so! There's been a lot of networking, con-building, forum forming, salons... <br/><br/>6. The fear is gone. I mean, I think I was much more worried back in 2005 about inflicting my designs on others - it felt like I'd have only one chance of Getting It Right, like every playtest was possibly the last one or only one I'd get. Now I've stopped callling them "playtests", I just say "I've made a new game, it's like this and this, want to join in?" - it doesn't feel like Work to anyone involved. (This happened with Jason and me on LitoS; we both had a "do yes" attitude, I think, and it was easy to bring in new ideas). I'm also much less worried that people will find Horrible Bugs in my games; I just take care not to promise more than I can keep. (If something's a game idea or prototype, you'll be told!)<br/><br/>7. Ideas come easy when everything can be accepted as an impulse for a game, and tools abound. I can look around me and pick things to make into a game, because I'm so used to playing so many different types of games. If you carry a belief that "RPGs must be like D&amp;D", you'll find it harder to come up with new stuff. If you, like me, believe that "RPGs are whatever I feel like designing right now, who cares what they call it", it's easy. Also, it helps to have experience from playing and designing games from many different gaming cultures - lots of tools to choose from.<br/><br/>8. Hypomania? I don't know. I've got some sort of mental up-and-down that, when I'm up, manifests in game ideas. Happy head = new game ideas popping up. (Also, being hungover can lead to game ideas; usually not happy ones, though).<br/><br/>9. Free time. I've been working less than 100% for the past half year, and time to ruminate and just hang out doing NOTHING seems to be very important when it comes to ideawork and design. I allow myself time to be tired, down and listless, to have days where I just need to sleep as much as possible and then go to bed early. <br/><br/>Anyway, I'm really happy I'm able to make so much stuff, and I do hope some of it is useful to others. They're all just games, I know - but what the hey, games are important in their own way, and not everyone can do Important Stuff. <br/><br/>So! If you want to be Real Creative And Productive, the points above would be my (current) checklist for getting stuff done.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279543/#Comment_279543" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-07T06:57:11+00:00" title="July  7, 2010  6:57AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow.

Getting my first game published in 2004 helped me get confidence about <i>publication</i>, but not really so much about <i>design</i>, I think. It certainly made it very much easier to be taken seriously; all sorts of doors have opened thanks to me having a Real Book with a Real Publisher.<br/><br/>But what's really helped me gain design confidence is making Archipelago, because it's so very much based on my own ideas and thoughts (to the extent that any thought or idea can really be one's own, of course), and it works well also for people who are not in my immediate gaming circle. <br/><br/>In a way, I've come full circle - I design games that are meant to be played (not just look good or, even worse, <i>correct</i> on paper), I design fast and loose, I have fun with my design and my play. Just like I did when I was fifteen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko" title="Seth Drebitko"><img alt="Seth Drebitko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w135/sethbashwinger/fetusgoplayavatar-2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko">Seth Drebitko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279566/#Comment_279566" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-07T10:59:52+00:00" title="July  7, 2010 10:59AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is great! \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>3.

It's just more fun that way. On my hard drive, it's dead space, and exists only when I interact with it, which I might stop doing if it doesn't feel alive and fun anymore. Putting it in other people's heads means it's alive and active, and wants to be born.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
