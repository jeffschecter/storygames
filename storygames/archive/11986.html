Adding the 4th in went pretty smoothly, but it was a little tough getting them enough screen-time due to the momentum the other PC's already had. Next session will be better for that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Character Creation</b><br/>\nAs in the session I sat in before that Chris Bennett (Ceasar_X) had run, character creation went very smoothly and we started with a set of characters already ripe with possibilities.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Establishing Hx</b><br/>\nI had read the Hx section several times and tried to grok how the the worksheet was used. I was never really confident about it though -- and the resulting misinterpretation on my part and confusion by the players made this problematic. Not from a conceptual standpoint -- I think it was more a processing issue. Upon discussing it at the end of the session, most of the confusion seemed to be on my side, the players didn't see it as that confusing.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the second session I tried to create a different form for establishing Hx and used it at the top of the session, once the 4th player had a chance to create their character. Again, the confusion ensued\u2026<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it was clear that the confusion rested with me, the MC. The players got it pretty clearly, even though there was some initial confusion that "on my turn" = my Hx with others vs. "on the other player's turn" = their Hx with you\u2026<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall players still felt that the system seemed a little complex for what it essentially does -- set starting Hx between PC's.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we wrapped up the session and talked about Hx roll over and improvement, a whole new discussion about Hx resulted\u2026<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Hx Roll Over</b><br/>\nAt the end of the second session a character with +3 Hx was awarded the +1 Hx by another PC. That made the PC's Hx "roll over"  marking improvement and resulting resulting in a drop to +1. The impression is that the History/Understanding/Relationship (Hx) had suffered when the character had changed. The player could swallow that but there wasn't anything in the game's fiction to really support this change and it seemed somehow unsatisfying.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe then started brainstorming some alternatives. I offer one of those that resonated with us  here. Not so much as suggestion, more as thought exercises and to illustrate the discussion of the topic at the table. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>\n<br/>\nThe one direction that we glommed onto was that improvement was improvement and Hx was Hx. We liked the sentiment of "Changing Hx (History) = Character Improvement", but questioned wether it was really doing that. Maybe they needed space\u2026<br/>\n<br/>\nWe then asked -- well, once we establish Hx what should effect it?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about the moves that utilize it? Helping/Interfering or Manipulating/Seducing? If you attempt one of these with another PC and you are successful, your Hx with them increases by 1 and their Hx with you decreases, and vice a versa for the opposite result and a 7-9 result had no effect. This was a little too simplistic because why would this be the case if you helped someone -- shouldn't you both increase Hx. So there was a matrix of possibilities that resulted.<br/>\n<br/>\nCoupled with this approach to Hx was the simple awarding of improvement by one player to another at the end of the session based on more open criteria like -- wether the PC had undergone a significant experience or if they had changed in some other way warranting improvement.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso coupled with idea was the idea that Hx topped out at +3 and bottomed at -3 and didn't wrap around more like the other Stats.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, an idea\u2026seems a bit complex though and removes the relationship of Hx and improvement\u2026<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>First Session Workup</b><br/>\nAs I said character creation was smooth, entertaining in fact. Another thing that generated a lot of juice was the follow-up questions -- not only in the first session, but the second as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the suggestions in the text is to "draw maps like crazy." I like drawing maps and have used a similar technique for other games I've run. Here's the main Hardhold and details surrounding the immediate area as well as a larger area that I made for the second session.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://dalehorstman.com/misc/DEPOT_Compound.jpg" rel="nofollow">Depot Map</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://dalehorstman.com/misc/DEPOT_Area_Map.jpg" rel="nofollow">Larger Area</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAt the end of the session I had several questions, possible Fronts (though many of them were problems on the Home Front) and lots of questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could have had a few more NPC's. I think I had 6 at the end of the first session. That seemed low to me\u2026<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Hard Moves</b><br/>\nThe second session was enjoyable. I found that most of the MC moves were simply things I already do. What I didn't do was make them HARD enough. I could have pushed and threatened MUCH more. I think that's a tendency I have from my own play style. I challenge, push, and prod PC's normally. I heap lots onto their shoulders, but I don't think I threaten them like they need to be threatened for Apocalypse World.<br/>\n<br/>\nCoupled with the fact that the lowest roll at the table the whole night was a 6 (before any adjustment) the characters accomplished their own moves easily and resisted and bowled through most of mine. I think there were two 11's a 12 and a couple of tens as well. It felt a little flat\u2026but I think it lies more in my lack of HARD moves than their good luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also felt myself a little distracted by my Fronts. I kept referring back to them during play and that interrupted my usual "flow". I wasn't as confident setting them up as I should have been. They also should have been HARDER. I'm going back and adjusting them before the 3rd session. I also found myself looking a couple of things up during the session that also chopped things up a bit. That is in part just learning the game I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this report is productive\u2026<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had a good time playing!<br/>\nDale                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267991/#Comment_267991" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-20T18:41:56+00:00" title="April 20, 2010  6:41PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On rolling over Hx: The book explicitly states that when go from +3 to +1 Hx with a character this means you have established <i>a new baseline</i> of history/understanding between the two characters, from which future increases will or will not then proceed. From a fiction standpoint I see it as the character reaching an understanding of the other character that is no longer contingent on circumstances or future relationships, but essentially permanent: they will always know that character better than they used to, regardless of future outcomes.<br><br>I'd actually like to see that reinforced mechanically, though given the over-complex-feelingness of Hx I can see why you'd want to avoid adding more to it. But a permanent +1 for Hx-based rolls (while still tracking additional 'contingent' Hx for further bonuses) regarding that character would seem appropriate, and also add punch to interfere/assist moves over longer campaigns (my feeling from our game was that Hx stuff was kind of toothless mechanically, though I really enjoyed thinking about it at the end of sessions, as a player.)                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267996/#Comment_267996" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-20T20:06:30+00:00" title="April 20, 2010  8:06PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice compound!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268392/#Comment_268392" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-22T16:02:43+00:00" title="April 22, 2010  4:02PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            FYI: There are new Hx rules.
