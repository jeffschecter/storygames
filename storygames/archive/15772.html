I invite anyone interested in providing feedback to participate.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis survey is being conducted for academic and informational purposes; it is not being conducted for purposes of marketing, and is not affiliated with any game company. It will not ask you how much money you make, what games you\u2019ve purchased, or how much you\u2019re willing to spend.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead, you will be asked questions regarding the games you play, your personal gaming history, and how you feel about certain aspects of game play. Many of the questions relate specifically to the <b><i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i></b> game, a common touchstone for most RPG gamers. Others do not, but relate to other aspects of gaming. And some of the information is for demographic purposes (age, nationality, gender, etc.).<br/>\n<br/>\nTo participate, you will have to download the survey from the following site:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.mediafire.com/?dvrtdmco8l55hq6" rel="nofollow">Gaming Survey</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIt is in a <b>MS Excel format</b>, and consists of <b>125 questions</b>, most of which are \u201cyes/no\u201d or \u201cmultiple choice.\u201d None of the questions require comment or essay answers. Some of the questions are personal; if you feel disinclined to answer a specific question, that\u2019s fine, but ANY information you can provide is helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you have completed the survey, you need to email it to:<br/>\n<br/>\ngamingsurveyresults AT gmail.com<br/>\n<br/>\nNo email address or name is required for the survey; all answers are anonymous and the individual surveys will be deleted once the information is gathered. There will be no follow-up emails and your personal information will NOT be distributed to others.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am looking to gather as much information as possible, as I feel there just isn\u2019t real, hard data on RPG gamers in general. A lot of assumptions are made about people who play role-playing games, but there isn\u2019t a whole lot of facts to back it up. This survey asks a lot of questions to gather many points of data. Please feel free to distribute this survey to other gamers that you know or direct other web sites to it; if you have a blog devoted to gaming, I\u2019d ask that you mention it to your readers. It doesn\u2019t matter what type of gamer you are (or whether or not you still have time and interest to participate in role-playing games)\u2026if you were EVER a table-top gamer, I am interested in your feedback.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you to all participants.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor more information about me: I am a gamer (and sometime designer) myself. I have a blog that I use to discuss role-playing games, my own gaming ideas, and the usual smattering of rants and random opinions. This survey is not about promoting myself or my blog; however, if you are curious you can find me at:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://bxblackrazor.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">B/X Blackrazor</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThank you again.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/StephaniePegg" title="StephaniePegg"><img alt="StephaniePegg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/185/n6ACKVL4YBWQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/StephaniePegg">StephaniePegg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357831/#Comment_357831" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-04T23:52:11+00:00" title="February  4, 2012 11:52PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 5, 2012 1:09AM by StephaniePegg.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seriously?

As I said, you don't have to answer any of the questions if you don't want (there will be a % of "declined to answer" for each question), but any info you can provide is helpful. As for the order of the questions...yeah, I'm kind of new at this "sociology experiment" thing. I tried to group them as best I could.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope to have the results organized better.<br/>\n<br/>\n@ I understand folks' concern. All I can suggest is to create a new email account on gmail or yahoo or whatever to return the results. Date of birth alone isn't usually enough for identity theft, and I'm not looking for names or SSNs or mother's maiden names or anything. You'll have to gauge your own level of risk.<br/>\n<br/>\n[that's not intended to sound like a dare!]<br/>\n<br/>\n@ Eero:<br/>\n<br/>\nExcel is just what I use, and the best way for me to organize the data I receive.

Too much work to download it and go clickety click in Excel, and then send it by email. (It's not like it's a <i>huge</i> amount of work, but then my interest in the project is merely that of a sympathetic on-looker, which isn't much for motivation.)

It took me maybe 10 minutes to fill out and submit.<br><br>Post-submission feedback, Jonathan:<br><br>Story Games folks may be grouches, but they're usually right. It'd seriously increase your response rate and data integrity if you did this up as an online survey - ideally paged into questions groups with context - instead of as an Excel sheet. Typing "Very Important" and "Somewhat Important" into several dozen little boxes is obnoxious (even copy + paste was not especially ideal). Checking radio buttons is way easier and also keeps you from having to do post-data collection edits and interpretations to aggregate the data right. While reviewing I now see I wrote "MP" instead of "NO" on at least one question, and that's unfortunately for you to clean up. All online survey tools will export to Excel so you can analyze your data, and many even do beautiful aggregation and reporting for you.<br><br>The demographics section is needlessly intrusive. I'm a very transparent person and had concerns about filling them out. Time and city of birth in particular is of no use to you whatsoever. I'd rather answer questions about income, hobby expenditures, and games owned since those could at least provide more meaningful data for the survey.<br><br>You're likely going to see a serious selection bias from putting the 90% of the survey that deals specifically with D&amp;D right up front. If I were you, I'd put the more "generic tabletop RPG" questions up top right after demographics. As it stands, as a person for whom D&amp;D is not particularly high on my excitement list, I got a sinking feeling around question 50 or so, that my responses were pretty much useless and painted a very odd picture of me as a gamer (like, I was introduced to D&amp;D in 1994, have played it at least once per year 3 times since then, but I currently play RPGs weekly and have an established group - all these questions are intertwined and my responses were so off compared to each other they made me feel like I was violating control questions). It wouldn't surprise me if some who get emailed a link to the survey by their friends will just stop after glancing at the first twenty-odd questions as they feel it doesn't apply to them.<br><br>Of greater importance, is the focus on D&amp;D to try to create some common gamer ground, or is it to specifically analyze D&amp;D gaming habits? If the former, anecdotally, my answers will pollute your data pool, as D&amp;D is no more a touchstone for me than, say, Call of Cthulhu is. My formative gaming years was spent playing a game derived from BRP-based rules (no levels or classes, less emphasis on dungeon delving, more on epic high fantasy, task-resolution type mechanics widely applicable outside of combat). Certainly this was due to me gaming outside of North America for the formative period of my gaming days, but I have met many North Americans with the same basis. Makes me wonder if the 100 questions or so that you have specifically on D&amp;D-style mechanics and play culture could be made more general to apply to a wider audience. While D&amp;D may be the biggest individual game on the market, now and in the past, all those games with a base mechanic derived from attribute + skill with no classes or alignments (CoC, White Wolf, Ars Magica, Shadowrun, GURPS, Unisystem) combined comprise a much larger base.<br><br>The above paragraph is all contingent on the notion that you're looking for common gamer ground, by the way. If you are, in fact, specifically looking for feedback on experiences with D&amp;D, kindly ignore (just recognize the inherent selection bias in your results). <br><br>What if my kids or spouse introduced <i>me</i> to D&amp;D? My wife was introduced to D&amp;D earlier than I was, and has played that game more than I have. Would I still put down YES on the "I have introduced my kids / spouse to D&amp;D", i.e. is the info you're trying to glean that my family is aware of and potentially involved in it, or that I specifically introduced them to it?<br><br>Throughout the survey, given the emphasis on D&amp;D and the intermixing of D&amp;D-specific questions with ones which spoke only of "roleplaying", I was confused as to if you meant roleplaying in the more general term or D&amp;D in particular. As one example:<br>60. The last time I played D&amp;D with others was (month and year):<br>61. The last time I played with someone new (for me) was roughly (year):<br>62. The last time I introduced D&amp;D to an adult (over age 18) was roughly (year):<br>etc. Is question 61 about D&amp;D or intended to be more generic? I couldn't tell, so wrote down ?. In actuality, I played an RPG with someone new (to me) two days ago, and regularly do so, but if I'd put down '2012' and then elsewhere said that 'the last time I played D&amp;D was Oct 2010' the results would've looked very odd.<br><br>Scales. For some questions, you probably want to use them, even though they can slow things down a little. For example, it somewhat irks me that my response that "we sometimes have a couple of beers while playing D&amp;D" is lumped together with "we get together to smoke crack and arbitrarily move minis around a board while giggling hysterically". <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br><br>Finally, I know you're trying to cast a wide net here because you're not sure what trends you might be looking for, but if I were you I'd stage this a bit differently. Start with demographics and questions on RPG customs and culture in general. Look for trends. Zoom in on a couple of trends and do a follow-up survey with questions targeted for those trends. A good example of how this could be carried out is the Daedalus Project (<a href="http://www.nickyee.com/daedalus/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.nickyee.com/daedalus/</a>), which attempted to do the same kind of broad survey for MMORPG players.<br><br>Don't take this too harshly, please.

I don't take it harshly; I appreciate the criticism.<br/>\n<br/>\nI admit, the survey IS more Dungeons &amp; Dragons-centric than is probably useful for a look at the RPG hobby in general. I have been working with and within the D&amp;D; community for the last couple years which has probably colored my whole approach (the idea for it came out thoughts on that particularly large group of game players). However, I also wanted to ask the indie community for feedback because...well, look, I completely stepped away from the D&amp;D; hobby for close to 15 years but was still very active in gaming. If I'd been asked to complete this survey 5 years ago, my responses to a lot of questions would have been very different myself, as I was as "grouchy" a "story gamer" as they come. However, I did have a long history of D&amp;D; gaming prior to that, and I think I still would have been able to provide some useful information to this kind of survey despite being a "non-D&amp;D; player."<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not a sociologist and I'm not pursuing a doctorate in "gaming studies" or something. The results of this survey is going to be skewed regardless due to it being targeted at on-line communities. But I suppose, in the end, that's the community I'm interested in, since those are the folks with whom I interact the most with regard to the gaming hobby.<br/>\n<br/>\nCall this an introductory attempt at gathering some facts. Maybe I'll get something more refined together in the (near) future.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358181/#Comment_358181" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-07T09:22:53+00:00" title="February  7, 2012  9:22AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Blackrazor</cite>I'm not a sociologist and I'm not pursuing a doctorate in "gaming studies" or something.</blockquote>\nHonestly, this is where you lost me.<br><br>You said you're trying to gather "real hard data" but I honestly don't think any useful data will come out of this.
