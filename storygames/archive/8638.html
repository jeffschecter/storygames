Sci fi setting. Shared world building. Make 3 proto PCs per participant, these are the main characters of the story. Each player selects one each as 'main character', flesh it out a bit and fill in stats. The GM gets the rest to use as NPC contacts/opponents.<br/><br/>Each PC and NPC shall have a Goal, something that they are actively pursuing. This goal has two meters, one "Progress" and one "Obstacle", if the Progress meter maxes out the Goal has been reached, that PC is happy.  If the Obstacle meter maxes out the Goal has become forever unattainable, that PC is not happy.  Once a meter maxes out that PC's story has reached it's conclusion, narrate epilogue and move on with a new PC.<br/><br/>The general idea is that the players should each play a PC somewhere in that shared world, though not necessarily in the form of a full blown traditional party, but rather as parallell stories, each leading along it's own path to either the PC reaching his goal, or failing to reach it.  As the PCs fail or make progress on their goals some sort of galaxywide conflict progress in the same manner, shadowing the life of the PCs. (Sort of like the computer game Wing Commander II, where how well you did on the missions reflected on situations far away, you did well and things went well back "at home". (At least that is how I remember the game...))<br/><br/>But what do the other players do when their main character is on the other end of the galaxy, possibly not even aware of the existance of such a person?  I don't want a lot of downtime, but still I want these concurent stories. Possibly even exchanges back and forth mid action, like in a book, where one section is about hero A fighting the baddies and just as it gets exciting the narration shifts to the suffering of heroine B in the hands of the \xfcberbaddie, and then back again to A still in that same fight sequence.<br/><br/>I have thought about the Panty Explosion solution where other players narrate the effect of die rolls. But I have never played that game, any comments on it's applicability for my purpose?<br/><br/>I have thought about just giving a player a Fate-point or similar as soon as he cuts his scene, that would lend itself to stopping at cliffhangers all the time, but might turn very confusing with many players. Comments?<br/><br/>I have thought about handing all the NPCs over to the players as well, the GM only narrates setting and handles rules, like setting difficulties of tasks and so on. Maybe some incentive like bonus for those players that play an NPC under someone elses turn. Comments?<br/><br/>I have thought about not doing anything about it at all. The players can sit back and listen, actively, to the other stories, and plan their next move in the meantime. Comments?<br/><br/>Have I missed any obvious option?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191273/#Comment_191273" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-05T06:56:31+00:00" title="February  5, 2009  6:56AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            it seems that if you're intending for player's character never to directly interact with each other, it might work to make the game GMless and distribute supporting characters among the other players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191276/#Comment_191276" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-05T07:26:12+00:00" title="February  5, 2009  7:26AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The other players can make more PCs.

Lots of games do keep players of off screen characters engaged by giving them something to do, but your determination that you need to give "inactive" players something to do is jumping to a solution without having first articulated that your actual concern is player engagement.<br/><br/>Player characters in My Life with Master aren't always simultaneously on screen. And if your character isn't on screen, the game doesn't give you anything to do. But you stay engaged because the on screen characters are dealing with the same primary antagonism as your character, and also because you had a hand in creating that primary antagonist. Bacchanal is comprised of player stories told in parallel that only sometimes feature the crossover of characters and events from other players' stories. Everyone stays engaged because the game throws difficult and meaningful storytelling challenges at the players.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191366/#Comment_191366" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-06T00:01:12+00:00" title="February  6, 2009 12:01AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul,<br/><br/>Thanks for your input. I'll have to look at Bacchanal some time, it seems interesting. But I am confident that I want something in the game mechanism that activates players whose main characters are out of the narrative focus. Maybe it is just the crowd that I play with, but I feel that it is important to activate the players. I myself also dislike beeing left out of awesome scenes. :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191387/#Comment_191387" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-06T08:49:36+00:00" title="February  6, 2009  8:49AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe you've thought of this, by why only one PC per player?

If they haven't experienced it, they panic at the notion of the players having "nothing to do."  But I've observed it again and again: <i>Listening is doing something</i>.<br/><br/>The other thing I've noticed -- at least in certain games I've GMed -- is that people are often grateful to have the downtime.  Often when playing a scene I'll spot a moment of panic in the Player's eyes.  They simply don't know what their character is going to do next.  So I relieve the pressure on the Player but cutting to another PC at the table.  This gives the Player uncertain about what to do next a moment to come up with an idea about how his PC will act or respond.  <br/><br/>I'm glad you've had the results you've had.<br/><br/>My only problem now is I'm trying to figure out how to explain to people how or why this idea of rotating story-time works.  I might end up having to say, "Try it, you'll see it works."  But that seems kind of lame.<br/><br/>Any other observations from your games?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202256/#Comment_202256" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-16T06:14:45+00:00" title="April 16, 2009  6:14AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, in my experience, not everyone stay engaged when it's not their turn in My Life with Master.

Specifically I'm talking about <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2476" rel="nofollow">"Weaves" and "Crosses"</a>. Both of those techniques have the effect of creating continuity between otherwise independent scenes. The theory here (and that's "theory" with a little "t") is that a player will stay interested in another player's scenes/storyline if that scene/storyline contains stuff that affects or involves stuff from their own storyline. <br/><br/>To continue expanding Paul's post, in MLwM for example, every scene either directly or indirectly involves the Master, who is important to everyone's individual storyline. Thus the logic follows that everyone should stay interested whether they are active or not in a given scene.<br/><br/>IME, that sort of thing works fairly well, though like I said, it's just a design "theory". It doesn't work 100% of the time, but I don't think anything does. I'll point out that Crosses and Weaves would probably be real easy for you to implement in your game, given that the players create a list of primary characters before play. Just make sure that a given scene involves at least one of the "proto-PCs" in some fashion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202267/#Comment_202267" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-16T08:26:44+00:00" title="April 16, 2009  8:26AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, thinking about this reminds me of my never-completed design <i>"In a Land Called..."</i> <br/><br/>That game was intended for GM-less/GM-ful play, but rather than a strict "rotating GM" model that mandated player roles, I wanted a loose GM structure that allowed individual players to choose whether or not they wanted to be active in a given scene. My idea was to come up with some sort of mechanic that mandated one or more players to act as the "protagonists" and one or more players to act as the "antagonists". Any leftover players could then choose whether or not they wanted to help "GM" the scene by playing either antagonistic or "support" characters.<br/><br/>My impetus for that sort of structure was that I enjoy---or sometimes need---downtime, like Chris was saying.

There is no need for a far fetched party configuration, players can have whatever PCs they really want, and the story will make sense anyway. Also, players get time to really think about what their character should do in a specific situation, or how they should react.  I often find myself in retrospect regretting they way my PC acted in some situations, when I did not have time to think I acted the way I would have done. But I am not my PC.<br/><br/><br/>As for other observations, my main one is related to "the story will make sense" above.  My game is pretty much shared world building followed by the participants setting scenes for their own PCs. And every time we have completed the world building step I feel the same "This will never work! These places in the game world do not make sense! These PCs have NOTHING in common!". But every time as we get into the endgame I am amazed to see all those things that actually  tied the PCs together, and made it into one coherent story anyway.<br/><br/>The form of playing, at least for me, makes a sum bigger than its parts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
