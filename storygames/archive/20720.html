My group of players doesn't really need help to build tension between their characters, since most of them find fun going paranoid / psychopath / distrustful at the slightest excuse. Okay, perhaps that's too much. Let's say just that they find easy to improvise reasons for tension but have a hard time making up reasons for trusting and liking each other. That's why this list of questions is geared to help their characters get together. I'll probably let them choose one or roll for it.<br/><br/>Besides this list I'll also ask them what does their group do, to help them agreed on a single group objective, despite all the personal agendas of their characters. So well, I'd like your help to make up some more questions or spot potential problems on the ones I've got here.<br/><br/>So far I've got:<br/><br/>-You owe your life to another PC. Choose who and explain what happened.<br/><br/>-Someone in the party made inadvertently something you found admirable. Who and what?<br/><br/>-Choose another player. brainstorm between you both one NPC both your characters hate. Explain how yo get to know him/her.<br/><br/>-Choose another player. brainstorm between you both one NPC both your characters respect/admire. Explain how yo get to know him/her.<br/><br/>-Choose another player. brainstorm between you both one NPC both your characters fear. Explain how yo get to know him/her.<br/><br/>-You've found the advice of someone from the party to be right on the spot. Whose advice was and what was it about?<br/><br/>-One of the party members always know where to get the best food or lodging in a town. Who is it?<br/><br/>-You like a lot one of the other PC's cooking. Who and why?<br/><br/>-When you get drunk you always ask one party member to do his/her trick. Who is it? That player get's to make up what the trick is.<br/><br/>-You always remember and tell a joke one of the PCs played to some stranger or opponent you all faced before. Who was it? That character's player gets to make up what was the joke like.<br/><br/>-You all have a favorite town. What's its name and what it's like?<br/><br/>-Who of the PCs was present when you decided to be an adventurer. How did that person influenced your decision?<br/><br/>-Choose another PC. Your characters meet through a common friend. Who was it?<br/><br/>-You just discovered one of the PCs is a blood relative. Who is it? What about that person would you say it confirms that fact?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455156/#Comment_455156" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-18T19:21:39+00:00" title="July 18, 2016  7:21PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 18, 2016 7:33PM by Paul_T.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How about:<br/><br/>-Choose a character you had a major disagreement with.

Didn't worked. I went back to them and asked this new group if they all wanted to good or evil alignments. I'k totally okey with any side as long as they all choose the same side. If they want to play Grand Theft Dragon, why should I try railroading things another way?<br/><br/>But when players in the same group choose different alignment for their characters, or even play characters of the same alignment whose concepts have no points in common, at least in my group that means they will naturally roleplay themselves out of the group generating tension whenever the slightest excuse arises. It isn't even out of malice, there can be misunderstandings or just an attempt at humor, it doesn't always go to too far and when it does it's so terrible we all laugh but the character chemistry is ruined and whoever got out of the group ends up making a new character geared for payback.<br/><br/>So, instead of just agreeing not to go there (cause we usually do before starting the game but that's no guarantee they will come with the same mood to the game) I prefer to give (particularily the problematic players) some inspiration material so their characters don't just start the game just as total strangers, ready to betray each other at the slightest provocation. This also helps expectations about the group to be discussed openly before the game, instead of everyone making assumptions about what should everyone be doing for each other, which is where most of our problems start.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455163">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jangler" title="jangler"><img alt="jangler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jangler">jangler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455163/#Comment_455163" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-18T23:03:15+00:00" title="July 18, 2016 11:03PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, IMO alignment has always been a rather silly idea. In my experience most people don't pick an alignment and then decide to play the character that way; they decide what their character is like and then attach an alignment label to that concept post-hoc, just because it's in the rules.<br/><br/>\u2026 but if a player decides that "chaotic evil" is the best descriptor of their character, then I think you have to watch out regardless of what alignment the other party members are. Translated into the tongue of Reality, "chaotic evil" means "selfish, backstabbing jerk" \u2013 which is quite an obstacle to party cohesion even if all the other characters are the same.<br/><br/>As an aside, I like that the LotFP core rulebook states that "In the real world, every human being that has ever existed has been Neutral."<br/><br/>\u2026<br/><br/>I think the backgrounds (including bonds/flaws/ideals) system in 5e is pretty limp-wristed. A lot of the traits are either too ethereal or too minor to serve as anything except vague hints about a character's personality, and most of them can't even be contrived into a means to get the PCs to care about each other.\n<blockquote>I've seen and copied questions from many places</blockquote>\nYeah, cherry-picking prompts that fit your agenda from more narrativist games is probably a good start. I think the important thing is that your players have a hand in creating those aspects of their characters, and didn't just pick them off a list as-written. You might even start off with no specific prompts at all, and just ask pairs of players how their characters know each other. Players are well-known for coming up with all sorts of ideas that a GM couldn't possibly have anticipated. If your players end up just staring blankly at each other for more than a minute, then you could start to throw in prompts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455167/#Comment_455167" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-19T19:15:43+00:00" title="July 19, 2016  7:15PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 19, 2016 7:16PM by David_Berg.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>-Choose another player. brainstorm between you both one NPC both your characters hate.

I watched a bit of the demo video, and it's a promising concept I would happily try.<br/><br/>David, above, makes a very interesting point, indirectly:<br/><br/>What is the purpose of these questions? The more you can nail down exactly what the *goal* is here, the easier it will be to pick or write appropriate questions.<br/><br/>I can think of a variety, all the way from "giving the players excuses for their characters to work together/like each other" (in which case "pick a character who once saved your life" might be just right) to colouring existing relationships to giving the characters things to talk about in moments of downtime to giving characters reasons to prefer one fellow adventurer over another to helping the players predict each character's future choices (as alignments somewhat do) to establishing goals to work on together (as in some of Dave's suggestions), shaping future play. <br/><br/>I also agree that D&amp;D alignment is a very, very bizarre idea. You start with the basic premise that we're dealing with a team of people who work together and trust each other with their lives... and then have them choose "alignments" which quite clearly position them against each other (at least half the time). Outdated game design, in my opinion, which could be done much better if re-built from the ground up (and with clear creative goals, as I suggest above).<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455186/#Comment_455186" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-21T20:39:40+00:00" title="July 21, 2016  8:39PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of my favourite roleplay moments was creating a Dr. Frankenstein/Igor relationship with another player in WFRP 2ed.

Really interesting suggestions everyone! Sorry I couldn't comment back earlier. I'll definitely allow my players more freedom and use first the implications of their character's existance to draw lines between them, ask them for further ideas to bring the group together and then use these resources to inspire them.<br/><br/>For example, one of my players already created a Goliath Barbarian with the outsider background, insisting that on his tribe he used to do menial work until he realized that the totems had been giving him signs that his destiny was somewhere else, and now they had left him behind. The tribe shaman rushed him to follow their steps. It's good so far, except that nothing here helps to connect him with the rest of the party.<br/><br/>Implications: <br/>-there's at least one Goliath tribe on the setting. <br/>-What he considered menial work was done at 10000ft on more or less vertical ground and while common for him, it's impressive for everyone else.<br/><br/>After further questioning the player, we defined another tribe, but their rivalry was limited to a yearly gathering for a ritual fight between members of both tribes who had issues among themselves.<br/><br/>Enter the rogue elf, another PC. The player still hasn't established too much yet, but he mentioned that he wanted to play with the concept of how having such a long life span makes him feel as if whole decades pass too quickly for him. So I asked how old was his character and he said 150 years old. I suggested him that that was enough to probably have met the parents/ancestors of all the members of the party, which he found interesting.<br/><br/>Implications:<br/>-there is (or was) at least one elf settlement in the setting.<br/>-There's a high chance that not every elf has it easy, for this one to become a rogue. Are they at odds against other races? how bad is their situation? I still need to ask this to the player.<br/><br/>The goliath player seemed to thought for a moment that this new information changed anything about his character and told us that since his character wasn't particularily notable and was an outside, there wasn't any way the elf could have know about him. I replied him that for a goliath he wasn't notable at all, but for an elf it's entirely different to see a "kid" about HIS size tending to frigging scary mountain goats on vertical terrain. He liked that, and the elf player and me liked that this also stablished the rogue as an adventurer, even before the time of the PCs, something we haven't see often enough on our games but that perfectly makes sense given the elves lifespan.<br/><br/>So that gives me one good way to link them all in the worst case. I'll try to find some more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455254/#Comment_455254" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-25T16:55:15+00:00" title="July 25, 2016  4:55PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Yeah, IMO alignment has always been a rather silly idea. In my experience most people don't pick an alignment and then decide to play the character that way; they decide what their character is like and then attach an alignment label to that concept post-hoc, just because it's in the rules.<br/><br/>\u2026 but if a player decides that "chaotic evil" is the best descriptor of their character, then I think you have to watch out regardless of what alignment the other party members are. Translated into the tongue of Reality, "chaotic evil" means "selfish, backstabbing jerk" \u2013 which is quite an obstacle to party cohesion even if all the other characters are the same.<br/><br/>As an aside, I like that the LotFP core rulebook states that "In the real world, every human being that has ever existed has been Neutral."<br/><br/>\u2026<br/><br/>I think the backgrounds (including bonds/flaws/ideals) system in 5e is pretty limp-wristed. A lot of the traits are either too ethereal or too minor to serve as anything except vague hints about a character's personality, and most of them can't even be contrived into a means to get the PCs to care about each other.<br/></blockquote>\nAfter playing with just the traits and bonds I've got to admit that it's quite weak. I've used Fate Aspect-like bonds with more sucess in other games. Well, it was more like phrases that defined certain moral standards or honor codes, or direct links to other party members, that I could invoke as a GM to get backstabbers in line. Alignments OTOH I see now like an useful crude guide for people with no experience on acting, to help them keep their characters consistent along the campaign. It enforces the GM to remind them to keep that consistency. Effective as it is, it's still primitive and limitant.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455255/#Comment_455255" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-25T17:14:01+00:00" title="July 25, 2016  5:14PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Warriormonk!<br/><br/>I think that's definitely cracking in - draw the players into telling stories about their characters with the DM as line-drawer.

I think that one key here is that these questions should come from the implications/consequences of whatever the players create.

I think that one key here is that these questions should come from the implications/consequences of whatever the players create. My friend tried open-ended questions when DMing Pathfinder, but it still felt somewhat railroady to me. I think that if the GM just shows the players the connections between what they have created and how things could crash it should be more than enough.<br/><br/>That's why despite we're about to start playing next sunday I haven't prepp'ed anything for the campaign, except for all the material I'll need to improvise over whatever they make up for the game, and I'm feeling relaex and quite confident I can pull an excellent campaign from this.<br/></blockquote>\nI think the "design solution" to fix railroadiness is - like you say - to prep DMs to react to player creation with constructive implications and consequences. <br/><br/>So really, I don't want a list of power <i>questions</i> but a list of power <i>reactions</i>. <br/><br/>Hm. I suppose it would be a list of "If that, then this" options, the more pressing implications brought to bare when players establish their characters as powerful:<br/><br/>So, if a player is establishing his character as an unbeatable warrior, then the "warrior" reaction chart might read "Of course, Victorious One, but what powerful enemy have you made who wishes you dead yesterday?"<br/>Whereas if the fighter player just established his character as the veteran of the last great war the reaction might be "Of course, Sargeant, but what rumour about you circulates amongst all who served?"<br/><br/>Am I making sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455526/#Comment_455526" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-07T17:31:08+00:00" title="August  7, 2016  5:31PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">@Potemkin</a>, so basically "yes, but", right?<br/><br/>Where the "yes" is to some character aspect the player creates, and the "but" concerns some sort of situation in the world which impacts the character(s) and might need to be dealt with?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455527/#Comment_455527" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-07T17:49:01+00:00" title="August  7, 2016  5:49PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ha!

Sounds like a solid principle for a certain type of adversarial storytelling, and I could see extending it to "no" and "and" as well.  Kinda in the same ethos as "you ask far too much!" from Polaris.<br/><br/>In the kinds of games I think WarriorMonk is talking about, though, I don't think players can just say stuff like "my guy is unbeatable" and make it so.  So I'd worry only about keeping "but"s fun for play, rather than scale or balance.  Well, that is, unless you totally ditch Pathfinder expectations and allow stuff like, "Yeah, my guy's a level 1 fighter, but he also happens to be king!"  In <i>that</i> case, I'm with you -- the downsides of being king should be bigger than the downsides of being a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy who has a line on rare poisons (or whatever).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jangler" title="jangler"><img alt="jangler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jangler">jangler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455531/#Comment_455531" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-08T00:28:51+00:00" title="August  8, 2016 12:28AM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had a player declare that his first-level fighter is the greatest warrior of his nation, as decided by a contest.

He wanted to play a legal good character.<br/><br/>Then there was an assasin thief, another thief, a warlock and a dwarven ranger (who didn't made it to the first session). I gave them all the aspect "without the goliath, we're screwed" and with the goliath's player we end up agreeing in "my party is the lesser evil" for his character, meaning that he knew they would end up doing bad stuff, but has found out most of the other adventurers to be far worse. <br/><br/>On top of that, we came up with a way for him to roleplay his LG: he's the "good cop" and will usually warn people trying to threat anyone in the party that they are bound to end up badly. If the NPC should persist, then he could walk with his conscience at ease and leave the party to do their worst.  The funny thing is (and he agreed on this too) that his character has CHA as a dump stat, so basically he's the first one to talk when things start to get violent and will possibly end up sounding more intimidating than diplomatic.<br/><br/>The assasin is a hired criminal and being an elf, the oldest one in the party (250 y.o.) He did said that he chosed an elf because he wanted to go for an atemporal character. For him decades may pass in the blink of an eye, so I ended up having his character meeting the parents of most of the PCs and even saving the warlock when he was a kid. He even got appointed by the warlock's mother (a black dragon) as bodyguard/tutor for his son, as she sent him to the world to find his own treasure. <br/><br/>Well, more like threathened than appointed, as she gave him a golden draconic coin she can track anywhere and vowed to kill him in the worst possible way if he didn't ensure her son got at least a decent heroic death at the hands on an important foe, if worst were to happen. In the session the assasin often shows this coin when he introduces himself and the warlock, usually right after this one tries something that could ruin social encounters.<br/><br/>So basically, I ended up using a few of their flags to connect each other and got lucky I nailed player's tastes on one side and that they collaborated nicely for the rest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455536/#Comment_455536" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-08T18:11:12+00:00" title="August  8, 2016  6:11PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Sadly our first session was kind of chaotic, so I ended up asking a few questions to the players about their characters, giving their character sheets a quick look and suggesting some connections (though a part of it was GM fiat) while just being careful of making sense.<br/>...<br/>So basically, I ended up using a few of their flags to connect each other and got lucky I nailed player's tastes on one side and that they collaborated nicely for the rest.</blockquote>\nSounds like you landed that pretty flawlessly.
