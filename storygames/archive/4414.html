It looks like we're going forward on playing a game of Rifts via Skype.<br/>I'd like to use this thread to discuss both scheduling and game expectations.<br/><br/>Commondialog, are you going to be GMing? I got that impression, and I think that's awesome.<br/><br/>Hopefully you don't consider this too control-y from a player, but I think we should all throw out some suggestions and expectations, and see if we can establish some consensus on some things.<br/><br/>1.) I'd like the game to have a party structure, and when we're all online and playing together, the group is together as well.<br/><br/>2.) I'd like our party to have a fairly unified feel to it. A backstory, a goal, a couple uniting factors. That doesn't mean we can't all be wildly different, but I'd like there to be some sense to what brings us together, rather than "you were all hired by a mysterious man".<br/><br/>3.) I was thinking about playing a renegade/ex Coalition soldier, who suffered through a lot of chemical experimentation, and as a result can't control all of his nervous impulses. So sometimes his body goes ahead and shoots the woman, even though he's screaming at himself not to, in blind panic. I want to play some form of tragic specialist soldier, I know that.<br/><br/>4.) I want to be from Free Quebec, personally. Free Quebec is detailed in World Book 20 - Canada, and World Book 22 - Free Quebec. Maybe elsewhere as well, I don't know.<br/><br/>5.) I just want to mention, I torrented a bunch of Rifts stuff. If anyone wants a certain book and doesn't want to spend the monies to acquire it, I'd be happy to email it to them. Just, y'know, if your ethics are as bad as mine are.<br/><br/>6.) I want to push for playing a fairly "straight" RIFTs, with two exceptions: players have some pretty heavy flagging capabilities (and the GM pay attention to them), and use explicit scene framing.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99728">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/commondialog" title="commondialog"><img alt="commondialog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/commondialog">commondialog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99728/#Comment_99728" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-28T08:59:26+00:00" title="September 28, 2007  8:59AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joepub, thanks for starting up this thread.  Can anyone who is interested in this game whisper me an email address if you have not already?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn answer to your questions, I will take on the running of this game.  I am definitely looking forward to doing so.  To your specific comments:<br/>\n1.  I am fine with this.<br/>\n2.  I could not agree more.  I'd like to work on the group's backstory together.  I find the "you all meet up in a bar and are thrown into a fight and become a party" DEEPLY unsatisfying.<br/>\n3 and 4.  So you want to be from Quebec, join the Coalition, be a test subject (why your character?) who then escapes.  What OCC are you thinking?  That sounds like a Crazy to me, but Canada may have some goodness in it.<br/>\n5.  I can neither confirm nor deny my desire for the torrents.<br/>\n6.  I am definitely cool with this, but I have two thoughts.  One, to me flagging is a word that can mean different things to different people.  Let's work through how to flag in a way that's consistent with Palladium on this thread.  But so you know, as a GM, I don't prepare overmuch.  I tend to start with a premise and then build the actual game around player flags as I understand them.  As for scene framing, I am all for it as long as you the players will help me through it.  I am not the world's strongest scene framer AND I have found that scene framing in traditional games can be tough.  That being said I honestly want to get better so hopefully you can bare with me?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow does everyone feel about me starting a Wiki for the game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/commondialog" title="commondialog"><img alt="commondialog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/commondialog">commondialog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99828/#Comment_99828" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-28T14:26:22+00:00" title="September 28, 2007  2:26PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Upon further conversation, let's strike the whole part about not being good at scene framing.  I think I may have some terminology mixed up and some bad examples of what that means.  So let's assume that I can actually describe what happens in a scene and we'll discuss what we want from scene framing...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99833/#Comment_99833" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-28T14:43:39+00:00" title="September 28, 2007  2:43PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm cool with a wiki being started.<br/><br/>As for scene framing, what I mean by that is: If what's important is a knife fight on a rooftop with two Headhunters and a Juicer, we frame to that. If what's important is getting onto the rooftop using tactical prowess and all of our cunning, then we frame the scene back a bit further to include that. You move to the important parts, skipping past the mundane and uninteresting.<br/><br/>Now, that's tricky, because what's important is a very subjective thing. But I think that if you've got no stealth types, and no one has made any flags regarding sneaking or using technology to avoid surveillance, you can frame like "You manage to make it through the security, dispatching a couple patrollers and dog boys along the way. You finally arrive in the Library Chamber." No one is particularly invested in that part of the mission, so why drag us all through it?<br/><br/><br/>Does that make sense? Does it sync up with your idea of scene framing?<br/><br/>Others: Am I way off? Is this something that's unappealing?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/commondialog" title="commondialog"><img alt="commondialog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/commondialog">commondialog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99870/#Comment_99870" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-28T19:51:56+00:00" title="September 28, 2007  7:51PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting...Thanks for clearing that up.  `I think that it makes sense and what you're trying to say is let's not roll a bunch of dice when we can just tell the story.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm a big fan of say yes or roll the dice and let it ride (thanks Luke.)
