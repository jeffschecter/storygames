For awhile, I thought someone was. But, since I haven't heard anything, I'm assuming it's dropped off the radar. I wonder...does that mean I've got a clear shot at it?<br/><br/>Let me explain: Once, awhile back on The Forge, there was this guy Mathias Jack, who talked about a game he was making. This game was called Fate, Luck, or Will--FLoW for short. Everything in the world was under the influence of Fate, Luck, or Will. Nothing else, not talent, beauty, intelligence, vision, or any of that shit mattered in determining if something was going to happen or not. Your character found this out the hard way, by surviving something that should have killed him. Like Jeff Bridges in Fearless, he came through where and when others didn't. Like the guy in Intacto, he knows how to manipulate it ever so slightly. Like Bruce Willis in Unbreakable, he had something keeping him focused, even if he occasionally lost sight of it. And like the chalk-outlines-in-cute-teen-bodies that littered the Final Destination films, Fate was looking for ways to rectify its mistake, subtle if possible, but if not...  <br/><br/>It was set up something like this: You know how the new World of Darkness has its attributes set up like  a grid? There's the ever-popular Body/Mind/Social divide, but there's also another divide going on, but there's also a Power/Finesse/Resistance thing going on. FLoW was set up like that latter grid. Fate was Resistance: no matter what life threw at you, you were covered, because as long as you had Fate enough on your side, you'd walk out alright even if a nuke dropped. Lung cancer? Mysterious remission. Bullets raining down on you? You aren't touched. They try to break you? Isn't going to happen. Luck was Finesse: you could dodge shit like a zookeeper in the monkey house, even if some bastard gave all the monkeys crank and Ex-Lax for lunch. To hell with a bullet hitting you, the gun wouldn't even be able to fire. Stay one step ahead of the cops, the crooks and the IRS. And your lies are spun from the purest fool's gold. Power becomes Will: When you get fed up and start hitting back, Will determines how hard you hit, how well someone listened to you, how easy it was to get the goods on someone, and how effective those goods would be in your hands. Also, there was a RoShamBo thing going on: Fate trumped Will, Luck trumped Fate, and Will trumped Luck. In no way did they mix.<br/><br/>I wanted to play this game, but I wanted more. I wanted characters to be able to spread some luck around if they chose to. I wanted them to spend some Fate and hex someone, either preventing them from doing what they're supposed to do, or setting them up for an Omen-esque accident of the fatal variety. I wanted these people to be able to alter destiny and fate, as long as they didn't mind the fallout. Hell, I wanted these characters to shoot beyond the Entropomancers and head straight for the Sidereal Exalted...but at a price: that price being their ability to stay grounded, to be able to relate to regular human beings. <br/><br/>But I also want their Doom hunting them, looking for the one that got away. I want motivations like the Muses from Nine Worlds, such that if they run out, your character is either going to drift away into something like the Statosphere from Unknown Armies, or end up dead in a way that looks like how he would have  died from his original accident. And like I said, if the characters get too powerful, they start to drift away from being able to affect things, except in extreme results. <br/><br/>I want magic, but the kind that's low-key and subtle and looks like action-movie physics until it gets too out-of-control. <br/><br/>Anyone have any ideas for mechanics like that? I keep envisioning something like Sorcerer, but not quite. Anyone have any ideas for what could motivate someone in that position? Because I really want this game. I've wanted it for so long, and it looks like it'll never materialize. If I have to do it myself, fine, but I'm open to suggestions. If it's still being made, I'd really like to hear how it's coming along, and I'll be happy to playtest.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103028/#Comment_103028" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-14T16:27:17+00:00" title="October 14, 2007  4:27PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 14, 2007 4:31PM by Joe Murphy.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Phew.

I can live with the dominant die triggering some cool stuff, but I wonder how to trigger the unintended side-effects of getting too powerful. I definitely want to pull off the Legend side-effect from Scion, where the person whammied can somehow end up tied up in the character's life for better or worse. <br/><br/>Either that, or use regular cards. Clubs for Will, Diamonds for Luck, Hearts for Fate, and Spades for Doom. But...what determines how many cards I get?

It's kind of interesting how everyone's looking for a dice-based mechanic. <br/><br/>And of course, now I'm thinking about kitbashing Fastlane into FLoW. Have Fate, Luck, or Will instead of using the PANGS attributes. Get an idea about how to set limits on what extra stunts are available at what score, of if I should just let people spend extra chips to pay for those bonuses.<br/><br/>EDIT: But everyone is currently leaning to DRYH, right?
