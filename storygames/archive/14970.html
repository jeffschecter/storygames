It went okay.  Characters &amp; starting situation built plus a few scenes &amp; couple quick one-sided contentions muddled through.  I bollixed up the Connections roll procedure and I think real world humidity sapped some energy from the game.<br/><br/>My question is about surveillance.  One PC, "Gum", gathered from Tang Lam, a splicer Connection, that C.N. Tai, another Connection he feels affection for, was in danger - somehow mixed up with some Russian mobster-types.  After that scene he set his buzzer drone (cam, linked, mic, rotor-fan) hovering outside C.N.'s dockside garage to keep an eye on her place in case any trouble came her way there.  It felt like we should engage the mechanics because he was wanting create a "sticky" situation and he would get some benefit out of the surveillance.  On the other hand, he'd spent 4 Kred on the thing.  No one is opposing it so it's clear there's not going to be a roll regardless.  I said he could use it to put a positive adjective on C.N. that might help justify a vector towards protecting her or intervening in any later Contention that might develop, but I also indicated he could just "do" it without placing an Adjective if he wanted to hold on to all of his Push dice for now and drone would be there and might lead to some interesting things in the narrative but that there would be no mechanical benefit in that case.  He went that route.  Does that sound about right?<br/><br/>We had two Contentions where one of the parties remained unaware of the presence of the other.  Should those be avoided/rare?  <br/><br/>After the group left Tang Lam, undercover cop Katie Cheng doubled back and wanted to hear/watch a vid call she expected he would make immediately after their meeting.  Tang is paranoid and has security cams &amp; sensors around his whole apartment so I decided it shouldn't just happen automatically.  Her Hack isn't so good so she elected to climb outside his balcony and Detect v Detect to listen via the air exhaust and sneak a peak at who he calls.  She succeeds, placing an Observed adjective and gets a fair amount of information.  Because Tang is so cautious and maybe because I want to engage with the Contention mechanics we are learning I decide Tang will "fight back" even though he's unaware of her presence.  I briefly considered simply having him try to detect her and placing a Caught adjective on her but because Katie feels Lustful towards Tang and I think it might reveal some interesting character dynamics I decide Tang uses Coax v Coax on her to see whether she feels any Shame in spying on him (the information she'd gathered didn't indicate any pending betrayal on Tang's part).  Nope.  He turns towards the balcony after the vid call and she's already gone.<br/><br/>We had a similar kind of one-sided one-party-oblivious Contention afterwards as "Gum" tails the Ku Tsang Motorcycle Club through the Eastern Harbour Tunnel and "Aztec" hacks into the lead biker's Nav system as they follow.<br/><br/>I felt disinclined to really fight back much in either of these Contentions; it's hard to see how to escalate the situation without any Push dice.  To the degree I even know so far, I like what is developing.  It's good I now have some time to lock down what some of these links on the plot map mean; I had a difficult time thinking up quickly the nature of each of the links as they emerged in play.  It's looking like I'll get some Push dice early next session as they get in the face of some of these Traid members.<br/><br/>I like how the PCs have a good chance of placing Adjectives and changing the narrative with even a "1" or a "2" Verb rating; no one has any verbs primed yet.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340329/#Comment_340329" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-24T10:00:49+00:00" title="August 24, 2011 10:00AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We just played the second session of our game set in the LA Sprawl (I'll be putting up an AP for that later). Our first session went very much like yours, and I also struggled to remember the Contention rules. The players wanted to use the dice and take action, to hack for information, snoop a crime scene, etc. In each case I basically made up target numbers (loosely based on threats from the book) and let them roll, but it was clear to me afterward that I should have just let those actions happen, creating fictional color and tension, and give them information. <br/><br/>We did better with it in our second session, but I still had to work sometimes to think about who the protagonists were working against. In one case the investigator wanted to find the Sunset Crew by hitting the streets and asking around. I decided it was his Detect versus the lowest Prowl among the Sunset Crew, reasoning that it would be the weakest link that would leave a trail he could follow.<br/><br/>I agree that it's nice that the PCs get a lot of early wins in the game- the GM doesn't have any Push dice to make it harder, so unless they go up against somebody with good stats, they're likely to win. When they win, they want it to matter, so they make it sticky/locked and give up their dice.

Using money as a motivator, I did the standard mission contract thing I'd done dozens of times with Cyberpunk games twenty years ago.  I think the dead-Connection-before-the-game-even-starts from the rulebook is really dynamite and I strongly considered stealing it but as PC was Lustful towards him and another Trusting, that seemed too promising to kill off .  He was also the only NPC initially connected to the mission seed as two PCs had gone to him for splice favors.<br/><br/>The three-point mission seed + the four Connections on the map (one connected) on the starting plot map is quite a bit of material to make decisions about immediately.  More temptation to start a game by killing a Connection off...  Ace the one guy connected to the conspiracy and make them dig through the wreckage.  Relationships and revenge are probably better catalysts than Kreds.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340345/#Comment_340345" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-24T11:06:01+00:00" title="August 24, 2011 11:06AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>After two sessions we're juuuust starting to see the complete game economy in action.</blockquote>\nI'm thinking Technoir, like Apocalypse World &amp; Burning Wheel, is not going to be a particularly good con game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340352/#Comment_340352" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-24T11:47:59+00:00" title="August 24, 2011 11:47AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: nemomeme</cite>I'm thinking Technoir, like Apocalypse World &amp; Burning Wheel, is not going to be a particularly good con game.</blockquote>\nI played with Jeremy at Gen Con in a two hour game, and while it works fine it does come off as more of a demo at that length. I'm guessing that a four hour slot with two or three PCs and some strong front-loading of the plot could work really well.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: nemomeme</cite>Are the PCs in your games all kind of a "team" initially?

It worked out that two of them knew each other through criminal connections and two set themselves up as private investigator partners. The fifth guy is a bit of lynchpin, in that he sort of knows them all. So in a rather classic plot arrangement, the story started in two places (a Connection being murdered and another Connection hiring the investigators to retrieve valuables from a stolen car) and is gradually knitting together. So initially we were just moving the spotlight around, but then the PCs all got together before the end of the session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340358/#Comment_340358" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-24T12:24:54+00:00" title="August 24, 2011 12:24PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2011 8:16AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm thinking for a one-shot introduction you'd need to pre-bloody some pre-gens, or find a way to do it quickly immediately after they generate their dudes.

While I love the character creation, I will be providing a selection of pre-gens that are 75% done - all that will be left to do is pick a 3rd Connection, assign Connection relationship adjectives, call in favours, and perhaps do some supplementary pre-game shopping as a result of those favours.

It was also my intent to simply use the opening session as an opportunity to make characters and learn a little about each of them.  I see what you're saying though and in the future I think I'd more likely use the opportunity to try to see/detect the PC, my NPC's Detect against their Prowl.  <br/><br/>That has its own issues when the GM doesn't have any Push dice though; Tang detecting Katie hanging from his balcony and spying on him would have fundamentally changed the nature of their relationship for a very long time to come.  I guess the inference there is that if you can't back up the repercussions of a successful action then you shouldn't take it and that the PCs have free reign to do all kinds of fleeting things until the GM gets some Push dice.
