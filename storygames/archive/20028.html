And you're right! But the RPG is a lot more broad than that, covering Pretty much anything where the action is assured, the stunts awesome, and the system is about whether you have an impact rather than whether the cool thing you just described actually happens. Of course it does.<br/><br/>You want to pick up a ladder, swing it wildly, knock down six guys, then have two of them bum rush you against the wall? Done.<br/><br/>You want to blow a hole in the floor to get the drop on the guys below you, spinning in mid air to plug five guys between the eyes, in the heart, or in the junk, before you land in a three point stance? Done.<br/><br/>It's <i>that</i> kind of game.<br/><br/>I might also suggest <b><a href="http://www.museoffire.com/Games/about.html" rel="nofollow">Capes</a></b> if you want to experiment with being GM-less, but I <i>always</i> suggest <b>Capes</b>. It's fantastic for putting the attention and focus right on the conflicts that matter to the characters on screen, and those characters might not be the "protagonists" at all. It's pretty all 'round awesome and its a shame it doesn't get more attention.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442854">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442854/#Comment_442854" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-14T11:13:03+00:00" title="February 14, 2015 11:13AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 14, 2015 11:23AM by Rickard.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Feng Shui 2</b> is coming out soon.

It is a very unusual concept (so much so I've had trouble selling it to my players in the past). But you can skip that aspect and play it straight. What most impressed me about HKAT (particularly when you consider the time it was written) is it really seemed to be the game that understood the subject matter, and in a way that wasn't poking fun at it. For the movie list/description alone the book is worth it (I had the second edition so can't comment on the first). Skarka definitely has a handle on Hong Kong Martial arts and action films. Absolutely had a huge impact on my viewing and how I approach martial arts in game systems.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DavidSchirduan" title="DavidSchirduan"><img alt="DavidSchirduan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DavidSchirduan">DavidSchirduan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442882/#Comment_442882" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-14T21:50:16+00:00" title="February 14, 2015  9:50PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh man, I've had a ton of fun with Wushu, and wrote up my own little hack for Star Wars:<br/><br/><a href="http://schirduans.com/david/my-creations/jedi-wushu" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://schirduans.com/david/my-creations/jedi-wushu</a><br/><br/>Wushu works well, but requires a small group familiar with kung-fu fight scenes.

We weren't playing kung fu action \u2013 I actually picked the game up from a very, very traditional dungeon crawl in the <b>D&amp;D</b> style, then changed systems in mid-game to <b>Wushu</b>. It was fantastic. Everyone was already invested in the tropes and understood the tropes of the kind of story that was going on, so when I turn them loose to actually make things happen that they expected to be able to happen \u2013 it was insane. People were having some of the best times of their lives, and I didn't actually mind that I was running a GM-full game.<br/><br/>That the game is now free just puts the capper on an already awesome choice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DavidVS" title="DavidVS"><img alt="DavidVS" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/nMT00GFQS5U2U.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DavidVS">DavidVS</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442952/#Comment_442952" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-17T02:54:19+00:00" title="February 17, 2015  2:54AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You could adapt my <a href="http://davidvs.net/hobbies/pathfinder-wrestling.shtml" rel="nofollow">wrestling house rules</a> for Pathfinder.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
