The large number of them suggests either the game is so popular that everybody wants to mould other games in its image, and/or it's incredibly easy to hack. I'd like to address the second possibility, and widen out the question: is it a lot easier to hack than other games, and, if so, why? The only system that seems to come anywhere near, AFAIK- in terms of volume of output on forums about hacking it- is Savage. But I have another question? What makes folk want to hack a game at all, rather than stick to the original? IOW why hack AW for game X, instead of just running either AW or Game X?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414314/#Comment_414314" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-19T06:02:27+00:00" title="May 19, 2013  6:02AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 19, 2013 6:04AM by JasonT.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I only have a moment to post, but I really like the questions starting this thread, so I'll quickly add something before I scurry off.<br/><br/>Is AW easier to hack: The fewer/simpler rules a game has, the easier it is to hack. I have really enjoyed hacking Castle Falkenstein over the years because the rules are amazingly simple and put a lot of control in players' hands. AW is very similar in both of these ways.<br/><br/>Why hack a game rather than playing the original: Genre appeal meets rules friendliness, I imagine. I have more friends interested in playing D&amp;D-style fantasy than post-apocalyptic drama, so I ran Dungeon World for them as a sort of gateway drug into Apocalypse World. I'd really much rather run a game with AW-style rules than a game that requires a D&amp;D Insider subscription just to manage character sheets, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg" title="semajmaharg"><img alt="semajmaharg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/482/n0TRVVHW3SOVY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg">semajmaharg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414316/#Comment_414316" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-19T06:09:19+00:00" title="May 19, 2013  6:09AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 19, 2013 6:12AM by semajmaharg.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are some games which have wonderful, evocative settings, but broken systems, so I can understand the desire.<br/><br/>I don't entirely go along with the Everything World mentality though.

But I can explain why I hack things.<br/><br/>Sometimes when game designing, I find a dynamic in another game that does exactly the thing that I want.  That is, two or more mechanics interact in a way that creates the desired player behavior.  And if I take that dynamic out of its existing context and lug it into a different context, it can serve a novel, useful purpose.  So like if I want to make a game about inevitable downward spirals into self destruction, I could try to make my own game and possibly have the mechanics fail to interact properly <b>or</b> I could grab Graham Walmsley's <i>Cthulhu Dark</i> and reskin it to be about whatever I want my game to be about.  Graham already figured out how to make the mechanics do what I want, so the initial bit of game design is already taken care of.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414322/#Comment_414322" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-19T07:10:27+00:00" title="May 19, 2013  7:10AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 19, 2013 7:16AM by Rickard.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>is it a lot easier to hack than than other games, and, if so, why?</blockquote>\nI can give an easy answer to this, because I experienced (and gotten feedback about) the same thing with my game.<br/><br/>It's because it provides, and is mainly about, a game play. About how you should use the game; how to handle the mechanics in given situations and how to create situations.<br/><br/>The only thing the "hacks" does is reskin the game, while keeping the same game play. <b>Fiasco</b> does the same thing. Each playset is actually a hack of the game while the game play is kept. That's one thing I find so brilliant about those games.

We've been over this.<br/><br/>And if you've been keenly following the online apocrypha, then Vx basically tell you, in ambiguous terms, how he made the game, how the game works, how it doesn't work and how you too can make a game as good as it or better.<br/><br/>Thus, disciples (such as Saint Harper, Saint Mcdalno, Saint Walton and Saint Latorra and the Thin Ghost) have had a pretty easy time writing their own gospels, err... hacks.
