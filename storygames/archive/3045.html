To remove the need for a color or exposistionary scene in game-play.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. To provide a quick means for people to be invested in the other chracters in a given session.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have some concerns about the system, in that its very much like requiring players to play on a play-by-post forum(though not in a very interactive fashion, which I'd view as a weakness of play-by-post) and there's a possibility of a cognitive disconnect between the non-interactive prequels and the interactive game play.<br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts, suggestions for a better system, referalls to similar ideas?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69643/#Comment_69643" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-16T09:44:22+00:00" title="May 16, 2007  9:44AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like bluebooking, Sean, which is an awesome technique in lots of games.  Basically, players are allowed/encouraged/required to write out short scenes or journal entries for their characters in between the regular face-to-face sessions.  This leads to some fantastic investment, although unless there is some mechanism to share the results, it can lead to some divergence and confusion, as I'm working off of an understanding of a bluebooking scene that you are unaware of.<br/><br/>The term 'Prequel' seems to suggest that they happen before everything else in the game.  If they're always between in-game action, may I suggest "interstitals'?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_69732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Musgrave" title="Sean Musgrave"><img alt="Sean Musgrave" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Musgrave">Sean Musgrave</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69732/#Comment_69732" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-16T13:14:50+00:00" title="May 16, 2007  1:14PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, you could be right about Interstitials being a better term. I'll re-evaluate it at the end of the week or so.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm wondering if I should employ the reward process during Prequels/interstitials - Part of me says that it'd be good to have a reward system there, to reward people for addressing their goals and whatnot. <br/>\n<br/>\nPrequels/Interstitials are basiccly a time wherin the player has complete control of the scene - Part of me says its kind of a bonus scene wherin the player can set up circumstances whoever they want for maximum reward, while another part of me says that its not normal play and shouldn't have the normal rewards.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69761/#Comment_69761" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-16T13:55:55+00:00" title="May 16, 2007  1:55PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For what it's worth, <em>Full Light, Full Steam</em> (my game) allows bluebooking between sessions.  There is a slight reward to it: if the journal entry or whatever falls under the auspice of one of your thematic batteries, you can 'charge' it and use it in the subsequent session.  So if in my journal entry I display how I'm a badass Veteran, in the next session I get a die-bonus when I do badass Veteran things.  The thing of it is, this reward is actually pretty slight -- it's basically a modest bump to one die roll -- but it works, it gets players doing it, and more importantly to me, it helps focus those bluebooking entries to emphasize the characters, rather than being unfocused "and then I did this" sequences.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
