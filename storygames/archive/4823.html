The whole thing can found <a href="http://polyfem.blogspot.com/2007/11/beloved-jakob.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. There I write amongst other things following\n<blockquote>I have a small game for you. Beloved Jakob is what I call a conversational game. It's for two players and no GM. The game consists of three pdf files. Both players read the short introduction file. Then the players divide the two player files between them, read their character file and engage in a conversation. This conversation is the game.</blockquote>\nYou can find the text in English as well as in Swedish. <br/><br/>On another note: Over <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=25175.msg243347#msg243347" rel="nofollow">here</a> in the playtest forum at the Forge me and Emily Care exchanged the following lines:<br/><br/>Me:\n<blockquote>There is almost no plot, the game is almost fully about their discussions about their memories, guilt, feelings and the problems of treating all this. It should be mentioned that the game is propelled mainly by the character descriptions which quite clearly defines the character and what will happen during the game (although this is usually invisible to most players when reading only one character).</blockquote>\nSven:\n<blockquote>This is an interesting aspect of scenario and various types of structured freeform play. It makes the writing, and interpreting for play very different. Do you have any reflections on the relative strengths and weaknesses of this type of presentation? It's something I'm thinking about a lot right now.<br/></blockquote>\n<br/>This very miniscule scenario (Beloved..., that is) is a rather extreme version of that type of game and if someone here would like to read or play I would be very interested in listening to any type of comments, (even language nitpicking) but especially comments from this aspect. (As late as yesterday I played Spione, which gave some interesting thoughts on this, but I keep that for later.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108359/#Comment_108359" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-15T04:58:14+00:00" title="November 15, 2007  4:58AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 15, 2007 5:06AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some thoughts - <br/><br/>The experience of play (and the outcome, which is the less obvious part) would be quite different in person as opposed to via telephone.  having the hang up as a way to end play definitively is a really powerful tool and i think the telephone version would ultimately be stronger.  <br/><br/>I only read Mia at first, based on your comments, and you're absolutely right - it'd be a bit of a leap of faith to engage with the game based on that incomplete understanding, but the two interlock nicely to propel the conversation.

I must admit it never crossed my mind that this was something in need of mentioning, but I realize now that with a different rpg background than me you might expect the character text to be more of general character background than being specifically written to create certain discussion with someone who has read the other text. With the other character, Lars, there is a possibility for a player not to communicate all his secrets to Mia, but I trust that most players would push a bit extra to get as much as possible through. <br/><br/>Since you both agree on the introduction I will probably do a change there next time I come around to some editing.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Merten</cite>Excellent background writing, Sven.

And the reoccurring statements are not only done in that fashion for some poetic reason, but also because they are in my min keys to the respective character, especially they are keys to the main difference between the two characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sven" title="sven"><img alt="sven" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sven">sven</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108500/#Comment_108500" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-16T04:01:39+00:00" title="November 16, 2007  4:01AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            BTW, Merten, you read the English version, right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108506/#Comment_108506" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-16T04:50:24+00:00" title="November 16, 2007  4:50AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sven, I agree that it is well written (in English).

I like it!<br/><br/>Put the two players in two different apartments in a way so that they can see the other player through the window, but not hear any sounds. Ze coolness! actually.<br/><br/>(BTW, my Finnish is limited to the words for one, two, three, sauna and some words for body parts usually hidden.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Sven, I agree that it is well written (in English).

The English text is slightly more straight forward than the Swedish version, since I am not totally idiomatic in English. (I use much more English than Swedish in my daily life, but I normally talk to Turks speaking English and these days Swedes speaking English, so I get these strange habits.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108513/#Comment_108513" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-16T05:57:56+00:00" title="November 16, 2007  5:57AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the idea of playing voyeuristic, <i>Rear Window</i> style.
