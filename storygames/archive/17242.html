If the winter landscape hates the PCs, then the cold bites them in their faces. I can also give strength to an environment (or a person ... or even a personality) by describing a contradicting emotion to what the PCs sees. The dark empty halls may give a calm sense, the torturer are really a nice chap or someone who's angry tries to control him/herself and can even give away a smile.<br/><br/>Cheers!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391051/#Comment_391051" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-21T20:12:32+00:00" title="September 21, 2012  8:12PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 21, 2012 8:14PM by Noofy.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jared's rule of three<br/><a href="http://urdwell.blogspot.com.au/2006/09/technique-jareds-rule-of-three.html" rel="nofollow">urdwell.blogspot.com.au/2006/09/technique-jareds-rule-of-three.html</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391053">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391053/#Comment_391053" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-21T20:44:06+00:00" title="September 21, 2012  8:44PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 21, 2012 8:45PM by Rickard.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a cool rule. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I still remember one of my players way back who wrote long descriptions about his characters, and after hearing about his cold blue eyes, the fine fabric in his clothes, bla, bla, bla, I kinda had enough. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> So nowadays I tend to just describe what's standing out from something.

I would notice it, but not speak up due to thinking that is your style of narrating.<br/><br/>For the second, me and Rudy made a really stupid-I mean silly way to do that by making the focus about drawing out the scenes versus roleplaying and having someone sketch on the fly. Inkcadia also does something similar, but the game is called Super Happy Sunday Apocalypse. Think comic strips with Chibi characters so it's easier and fast to draw for good times. You can see it next week or so when I upload it to the Mom's Basement Podcast website.<br/><br/>Edit: crud, I totally forgot to add to the thread. I would say the writing system I came up with a few months ago. Narcissistic, I know, but it has helped quite a bit with the players who aren't fully sure what they are doing in the game for their character. Plus, it's always entertaining when they trash talk each other after they're done writing their letter.<br/><br/>The game/system is called We'll Send It To Them and the full rules are on the IndieGoGo project if you just want to fully read them. It's best suited for after session roleplaying or for conflicts you want to stretch out (like a jedi lightsaber fight and such).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391078">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391078/#Comment_391078" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-22T07:17:29+00:00" title="September 22, 2012  7:17AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah I was a big fan of <a href="/forums/profile/BlazmoIntoWowee">@BlazmoIntoWowee</a> 's use of the camera techniques in our G+hangouts game of Psi*Run.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391079/#Comment_391079" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-22T07:24:38+00:00" title="September 22, 2012  7:24AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Jared's rule of three<br/><a href="http://urdwell.blogspot.com.au/2006/09/technique-jareds-rule-of-three.html" rel="nofollow">urdwell.blogspot.com.au/2006/09/technique-jareds-rule-of-three.html</a></blockquote>\nOf similar use, my favorite method of generating character descriptions ever remains Over The Edge's Signs. Basically, for each trait, you figure out some way in which that trait impacts your appearance or easily-observable behavior: so a trait like "fighter" might have a sign like "well-built", "always carrying a weapon", "lots of scars" or whatever, as long as it made sense for the trait: and you would, since you had four traits, end up with four awesome descriptors which, like Jared's Rule of Three, nicely alleviates the "height weight eye-color"-style details.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391142/#Comment_391142" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-23T07:15:17+00:00" title="September 23, 2012  7:15AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>Explicitly cinematic camera tracking shots.</blockquote>\nCare to elaborate, perhaps with an example? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I've been playing a lot of action RPGs these last few years, so this sounds interesting.</blockquote>\nIt's mostly about making an effort to be mindful of including more dynamism and movement in my static descriptions. A lot of what others have said about describing the viewpoint of an observer shifting to pan and zoom to give what would otherwise be bog-standard ten-foot room descriptions some sense of happening in time and leading directly to whatever action is going to happen there.

During combat, when playing action styled RPGs, I explain to my players that they should see a combat round as the camera is shooting their character. Each new action with each PC is like the camera is cutting between them. So when the camera isn't pointed against their character they may do something else in between. Perhaps climbing up the mast so they can have a duel there, moving to the stairs to fight off the queen's royal guard or discovered something in the scenery that they may use. As you can see, it's mostly about moving (I don't play with rules for movement at all in any RPG, except tactical ones). I've discovered that it's a technique that's quite common in action movies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391225">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391225/#Comment_391225" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-24T12:33:05+00:00" title="September 24, 2012 12:33PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 24, 2012 12:46PM by Upstart.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is tangential, but at the moment I'm really interested in converting this kind of evocative narration into hard rules that actively push the GM and the players to describe stuff.

It follows this simple list:<br/><br/>(0. Tell your intention.)<br/>1a. Say what you use in the roll.<br/>(1b. Roll the dice.)<br/>2. Describe how the roll takes effect in the fiction.<br/><br/>Lets say you want to roll for the skill/trait/whatever Cake Baking. You roll and succeed (or fail), and if you don't describe what you did then the roll was pretty pointless. Nothing happened because you gave no input to what would happen (and so didn't the system either). In some games (most games?), the GM usually wants to give some modification to the roll. In that case, you use number zero on the list.<br/><br/>I usually don't care what the players roll for, as long as their motivate how they use the skill to achieve what they want. "You want to unlock a door with Pie Baking? Sure, as long as you can describe it." How did Odysseus escape the cyclops using a riddle? This is something you can use with any dice mechanic or with no randomness at all, as long as you or the system gives something to the players to include in their descriptions. My name for this sort of thing is \xbbcreative challenge\xab. Been playing with this for the last five years.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
