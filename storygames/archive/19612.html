Allthough I'm not the illustrator, I'm the graphic designer. So my job is to make pretty much everything that isn't writing, building rules systems or drawing. Layout, typography, ornaments, getting it ready for print, those things. And unfortunately our illustrator does not have a deviantart page or any type of online portfolio as far as I know. There are some more illustrations on our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/jarnringen" rel="nofollow">facebook page</a> and on www.jarnringen.com\n<blockquote>Pappa -- a question on the setting -- what sort of factions are there?<br/></blockquote>\nSo, these are the main factions that we are featuring in the book: First you have the Ambrians led by queen Korinthia, who brought her entire people from the war devastated lands in the south, to rebuild her empire and claim the resources of the forest. Ambria is divided into seven duchies (funny word), and they are in turn split into smaller areas called baronies or counties depending on size. Then you have the barbarians of Davokar and the plains to the west. These are the people who lived in the area before the Ambrians arrived and they have a better understanding of the forest and have a fragile agreement with the mysterious elves on how to treat nature. The barbarian culture is built around taboos on what not to do, where not to go, what not to hunt etc. There are twelve different tribes (there used to be thirteen before the Ambrian army "pacified" them), each with their own leader, and the ways the different tribes handle the arrival of the Ambrians has led to some conflicts between themselves. <br/>The major religious power in Ambria is the Church of Prios, the sun god. They are a powerful organization and are responsible for the interpretation of Prios commandments and to ensure that the Ambrians harvest the treasures of the forest in a steady pace to save their dying god. You also have Ordo Magica, the most powerful order for scholarly studies and the nurturing of magical abilities. They are mainly focused on exploration of different areas such as botanics, knowledge of elves, categorization of beasts, mystic powers and artifacts, and also the exploration of Davokar itself and the ruins of Symbaroum.<br/>Then there is the Queens army, which includes the hunter brigade - an intelligence and reconnaissance force who mainly operate at the edges of the kingdom.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Denys" title="Denys"><img alt="Denys" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j128/iannoble/elf-pic.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Denys">Denys</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435990/#Comment_435990" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-29T14:30:04+00:00" title="July 29, 2014  2:30PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pappa -- very cool.

This is really gorgeous.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the two previous games were of the type of 90:s style RPGs with a very low degree of proceduralization for GMs unless you bought into their adventure path-like campaign books.<br/>Coriolis also suffered from a core book whose setting was, rather than succint and expandable, more phrased as a tease, implying that you should get more books.<br/>I\u2019m <em>not</em> saying that they just pushed the core books to sell other books or tried to push any kind of shenigans like that. They are good people.<br/><br/>I\u2019m just saying that both games were of the type of game that I found really hard to run.<br/><br/>I wish I had a name for that category of games.<br/>I\u2019ve said before that in the seventies, the games were like \u201cOk, DMs, make a world \u2014 and here are some tools for that \u2014 and set the players loose in that world\u201d. Worked great.<br/>In the modern day, the games were like \u201cOk, tables \u2014 here is how you create a story together, and here are some tools for that.\u201d Also works great. Plus, the old style of \u201cset them lose in a world\u201d has been rediscovered and I love that style so much.<br/><br/>But in the middle there was this huge like thirty year long dark age of games that were like \u201cOk, DMs, be good and experienced and know that a good story should have it\u2019s ups and downs and peaks and also you should create an exciting story where the players are the heroes and yeah. Um.\u201d Rules for the players became detailed with plenty of skills and advantages whereas the GM\u2019s role became more and more implicit.<br/>I could never run any published \u201cpath\u201d-style adventures successfully nor understand how I could run anything in these games except improvising, in which case the rules got in the way rather than helping. So Underg\xe5ngens Arvtagare &amp; Coriolis were a bad fit for me personally.<br/><br/><br/>Symbaroum looks amazing and maybe, as you note, Apocalypse World inspired mechanics can be a good fit. Its MC moves are an interesting way to proceduralize the way some GMs (for example in the Talislanta community) ran those games.<br/><br/>Good luck with the new game, guys!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436152/#Comment_436152" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-01T07:26:24+00:00" title="August  1, 2014  7:26AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I\u2019m going to give it a chance of course!

Each scene leads strictly to the next.<br/>Scene 7 can lead to either scene 8.1 or scene 8.2, but either leads to the end scene. The final scene is just a long boxed text. The same no matter what happened.<br/><br/>On page two it says: \u201cShould the player characters do something not mentioned in the description of the scenes, it falls to the GM to improvise and carefully guide them back to the main line through the adventure.\u201d<br/><br/>I don\u2019t know how to run these games and I don\u2019t know how to play in them.<br/>That\u2019s just how it is.<br/><br/>Good luck to those who make this game and to those who buy it. The rules are simple, straight-forward and BRP-like and there\u2019s nothing in the rules mandating the adventures to be run like this. I guess it\u2019s meant to be like a tutorial, but my experience is that such tutorials are hard to run. I\u2019m sure you can have fun with it especially if you bring in a little sandboxy sensibility to it. The set up \u201ctreasure hunters in the wild forest\u201d is awesome and the foes in the forest are inspiring and interesting.<br/>Unfortunately the core book is detailed about the fluff for the regions surrounding the forest \u2014 the fluff the player characters have to abide by \u2014 but very vague about how to run the actual forest.<br/>Another game that loads a lot of complexity on the players and leave the GM up to tell a great story in some vague manner.<br/><br/>It is so beautiful though... maybe I can mash it up with some other game? Take what works from Symbaroum and insert it into the structure of a game I know how to run... Yeah, it\u2019s salvagable.<br/><br/>TL;DR: no need to learn Swedish. Get it as an art book and make up your own stuff. Get the map so you can use the place names.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436512/#Comment_436512" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-05T23:19:31+00:00" title="August  5, 2014 11:19PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 6, 2014 4:44AM by 2097.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It\u2019s not similar to Apocalypse World.

It's frustrating for me to engage in that - it's why I never ran modules growing up. I love tactical or concrete rpg games, but if there are no rules to help stories grow organically, it seems you're stuck in that awkward halfway house of "let them loose" and "adhere to the story"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436589/#Comment_436589" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-06T13:19:48+00:00" title="August  6, 2014  1:19PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I often think I am so innovative with my \u201cGrand Theory of 90:s Gaming\u201d but then I re-read Forge stuff and go \u201cOh, yeah... that\u2019s right, those guys realized this stuff, also...\u201d and I don\u2019t feel so clever anymore.
