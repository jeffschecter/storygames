Legend is a permanent part of your character sheet - possibly added to a wider variety of roles, but it is also more expensive to develop.  <br/><br/>Without the book in front of me, InSpectres Bank vs. Cool might be a starting place, but I'm looking for other suggestions or thoughts....                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonP" title="JasonP"><img alt="JasonP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wishray.com/jp/the_penguin.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonP">JasonP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146355/#Comment_146355" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-28T04:56:10+00:00" title="May 28, 2008  4:56AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can really dig some of the ideas that come into my mind upon reading this, and I would strongly urge you to develop without constraint at this point. I would first try and figure what the game it about, meaning what the characters do and who they are before doing anything else.

For sometime, I have been toying with the idea of "level" as a measure of how wide a character's legend had spread and that the whole game was really recounting of the heroes' adventures by bards.  I'm not sure how fame is fleeting ties in - but somehow it feels like a "spend your XP" for great effects now - or save it for later to level up.  <br/><br/>In both cases, there is a balance thing in there that troubles me.  I want it to be a struggle for the players to decide to save up for legend - not the obvious path.<br/><br/><br/>In the end, Your callouts are sort of why I threw this out as a "little idea".  It's scratching around in my head and I'm not really sure what to do with it yet.....                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146457/#Comment_146457" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-28T11:50:52+00:00" title="May 28, 2008 11:50AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, legend is like a stat that is always in effect. If you have Legend 2, that legend follows you around everywhere you go.<br/><br/>Fame is like XP. You do something big, you get a pile of Fame. You can spend it to improve rolls here and there, and sometimes that will net you more Fame - success builds on success. But there is always the chance of failure, and you can fail big-time, too, and lose all your Fame. Or, you can bank it, and use it to build up your Legend. It takes a lot of Fame to create a little bit of Legend, though, and it takes time - you can only put so much Fame into Legend every session.<br/><br/>But once you have Legend, it always works. It's always there for you to call on, and it can't be taken away from you except by new generations of people who forget you or never learn who you are.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146711/#Comment_146711" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-29T13:27:00+00:00" title="May 29, 2008  1:27PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 29, 2008 1:27PM by Tristan.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For a gladiators campaign I once played, we used a nice Fame and Legend scores rule.<br/><br/>When the gladiators won their matches, they won fame points. The more spectacular and/or inspiring the win, the more points it earned. Defeat meant loosing fame, but not always (some lost matches could just as well raise the fame of a very loved gladiator, the same way it sometimes does in Wrestling matched).<br/><br/>Fame points were good for social stuff. They helped you impress the crowd better (they started recognizing your signature moves and stuff), to intimidate less famed opponents and even to get special prices for stuff (I call that the "superstar effect").<br/><br/>If you didn't fight regularly enough, the masses started forgetting about your deeds. They are only interested this much in a "was", with so many "are"'s out there. So after some time without someone witnessing your awestucking moves and tactics you'd start loosing fame points at an accelerating pace (1 lost point after a week, 2 the next one, 4 the following one...). So you'd want to remain fresh in the minds of the audience.<br/><br/>Another important aspect was the area of influence. At first only people who have watched you know you. Your fame is so small it only counts for some people (those within your arena at the time)...<br/><br/>Then, as your fame grows, more and more people know you by name and recognize you by what you are. So your fame works for people in your city. After a while, the word is starting to spread, and more people have heard the tales of your amazing combats and your (in)famous skills.<br/><br/>Finally you reach a state when your reputation has grown so much that people start spreading rumors that are perhaps not as realistic as the true facts. You defeated those two clockwork bulls while blindfolded and with a hand tied to your back. Your ultimate finishing move won you the love of the Caliph's daughter. Even Brom the Nasty fears facing you at the arena...<br/><br/>By this stage, your fame points start "evolving" into legend status (something like David's idea of "buying the Legend points with fame points" doesn't seem so bad at this). The good part is your legend points no longer are subject to time losses. You are a legend now, and people will remember you whether you fight or not. Everyone in the Realm knows who you are, your name, signature moves and your most famed and cool victories. Legend points are more powerful and are useful in a more wide actions range. They can be used to gain influence with the aristocracy, to enhance your economical capabilities, to make people trust you easier, to command others to do what you ask them to...The bad part is your name no longer belongs to you. You owe everything you are to your audience. So you have little privacy, you inspire both the hottest love and the coldest hate, and people have elevated you to an idealistic status... So any defeat people witness will most likely harm you more than ever. Even the most meaningless lose could mean you'd loose Legend points (and those are expensive to say the least). So you have to learn to pick your fights.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
