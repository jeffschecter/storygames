I read them, and I translate them into language that makes sense to me.  This is how I read them:<br/><br/>Some people say things like "This would never happen in a decent group, so let's not worry about it.  It's purely hypothetical."  Other people say things like "This would never happen with a decent system, and if we had one, then we wouldn't have to worry about it."  And, of course, they're both right, at least part way.<br/><br/>But what is it that good groups and good systems do that prevents the sorts of breakdowns we've been discussing?  It finally dawned on me:<br/><br/>They promote the free flow of information between interested parties.<br/><br/>Stakes setting?  Yep.<br/>Scene framing?  Yep.<br/>Effective social negotiation processes?  Yep, same thing.<br/><br/>So I say, when you read a chunk of game text about how a group should function, ask yourself:<br/><br/>Does this text promote or hinder the free flow of information between group members?  In what ways?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150539/#Comment_150539" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T12:32:40+00:00" title="June 13, 2008 12:32PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure its that's straight forward, look a dinner mystery , the free flow of information HAS To be hindered in order to maintain mystery. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don't think there is the one true good, ever                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150542">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150542/#Comment_150542" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T12:34:17+00:00" title="June 13, 2008 12:34PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the way that Vincent has broken down System, on the Forge and (mostly) on Anyway, to the way that you answer two questions:<br/><br/>What should I contribute to the game?<br/>How should I treat my fellow players' contributions?<br/><br/>When everyone knows the answers to those questions for THIS group, for THIS game, for THIS session, then you've got a real type of thing goin' down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150558">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim" title="Jeffrey Straszheim"><img alt="Jeffrey Straszheim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim">Jeffrey Straszheim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150558/#Comment_150558" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T12:58:03+00:00" title="June 13, 2008 12:58PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Logos7</cite><br/>I'm not sure its that's straight forward, look a dinner mystery , the free flow of information HAS To be hindered in order to maintain mystery.<br/></blockquote>\nSure, but the anti-rule-zero folks are absolutely correct that if the GM just keeps ignoring rolls behind the screen, and shit like that, and doesn't pay attention to what the players are feeling, the game will likely suck.  I'm sure that is what Max is talking about, not that the GM is obligated to point out every secret door.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150623/#Comment_150623" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T16:12:30+00:00" title="June 13, 2008  4:12PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you value the mysterious parts of a mystery remaining that way until such time as it's time for them not to be, then you're not an interested party for those bits of info.
