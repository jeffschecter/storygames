It has some similarities to Exalted, but is set in the modern day, with the characters as the offspring of the gods of various pantheons.  It's pretty stylish, it has centaur motorcycles and dwarves that turn to stone in the sunlight and things explode and there's magic.<br/><br/>I was a bit inspired by how great the Tenebrous r-map came out without even any significant attention on my part, and intend for the game to have a much more wide, and deep, relationship map, with unexpected relationships popping up here and there, and the players taking on NPC roles on a semi-regular basis. I may also have some inconsistent narration and basically all the junk that I love.<br/><br/>I read about someone's (it may have even been a story-gamer's!) Cyberpunk 2020 campaign called <i>99 Problems...</i>, about a rapper's entourage and their adventures in a teenage wasteland, I mean their adventures in the future.  I immediately thought the format for this game would be like a really stylish television show, with each problem actually numbered. So someone would come in with a subpoena that conflicts with a flight to Tokyo and there would be a freeze-frame on the subpoena and there would be a graphic that said "PROBLEM 8", or a guy suddenly popping up in a restaurant with mini-guns and yelling and starting to fire, there would be a freeze-frame and a graphic that said "PROBLEM 19", and the show would be over after 99 problems. I have no idea if this is what that person's game was like. But that's what I thought it SHOULD be like.<br/><br/>Anyway, I was trying to think of a good name for the campaign that would suggest a certain kind of format, like Lexicon is played through entries in a dictionary, and my idea for "99 Problems" would be to divide the game into problems.  What should I do for a game of modern-day children of the gods having high-flying, face-punching adventures and the ripples of their activities and the magical world they're in spreading ever-outwards in a relationship map that would even, could such a thing be imagined, be better than my Tenebrous r-map?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_78533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78533/#Comment_78533" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-28T12:52:29+00:00" title="June 28, 2007 12:52PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I suggest "The Game I Invited Kynn To Play."<br/><br/>Or Pandora's Boxers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_78536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78536/#Comment_78536" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-28T12:57:53+00:00" title="June 28, 2007 12:57PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps you could call it The Attributes of the Gods, and find a nice list somewhere of all the specific, Homeric words or phrases associated with all the different gods.
