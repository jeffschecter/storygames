The cleric thinks that the bard is better at being a cleric than the cleric is, since the 7-9 is much less stringent for the bard when healing through arcane art, vs. a casting of Cure light wounds that could be revoked or put the caster at -1 until their next casting.  This has been exacerbated by the bard choosing healing song as an advanced move, giving him 2d8 heal, where the cleric won't get that until level three, and even then will dedicate the majority of their spell list to it, when the bard gets it as a choice of three useful buffs in arcane art.

On a 7-9 for the cleric, it might attract some unwanted attention, he might lose the spell, he might get -1 for a bit, HIS choice. So, the cleric is like a bard who will never accidentally heal his enemies, but can choose to take a small ongoing penalty or forget the spell if attracting extra attention would be really bad. <br/><br/>Now, I mean, the 2d8 versus 1d8 thing, the bard DID sink a move into being a good healer. The cleric could do likewise! You want to be a healbot? First Aid lets you get Cure Light Wounds for free, Empower Spell could DOUBLE ALL healing on a good roll, etc, etc. And that's not even touching the level 6-10 moves.<br/><br/>And don't forget Divine Guidance! Is your cleric's deity a god of healing and restoration? Whenever he fulfills a petition, he could be getting healing and restoration for him or his allies from on high, no roll needed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nifelhein" title="Nifelhein"><img alt="Nifelhein" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/888/nUG22UPKX7MJD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nifelhein">Nifelhein</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403548/#Comment_403548" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-12T08:48:25+00:00" title="January 12, 2013  8:48AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            D&amp;D players often pick loose a spell over the other options, that might be the issue there too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403556">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JLHBurnett" title="JLHBurnett"><img alt="JLHBurnett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/722/nB1X4KGH4YFEW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JLHBurnett">JLHBurnett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403556/#Comment_403556" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-12T11:52:15+00:00" title="January 12, 2013 11:52AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The first time the bard rolls a 7-9 on Arcane Art and heals the dragon they are fighting for 2d8 hp, I think their opinion might change.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403557/#Comment_403557" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-12T12:02:31+00:00" title="January 12, 2013 12:02PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Bard move calls for him to "weave a performance" into a spell.

And, on a 6 or under, you can highlight the differences in how their magic works by how they botch -- perhaps once or twice on a miss, the bard's magic only heals the party's foes, or alerts more foes, while the cleric's misses tend not to do that sort of thing.  <br/><br/>I'd also just like to mention that it's odd when people go into a game like this with a competitive mindset that they're worried about who can heal the hardest!  <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ninthcircle" title="ninthcircle"><img alt="ninthcircle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/505/nCDTHAFF3E2HP.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ninthcircle">ninthcircle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403819/#Comment_403819" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-16T12:56:26+00:00" title="January 16, 2013 12:56PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you all for the excellent feedback!
