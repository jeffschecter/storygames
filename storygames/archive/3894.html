If, on the other hand, you're asking me if what i do feels like it belongs in the category of "proper" games, i.e., having winning conditions and so on, then, no, it most definitely is not. Particularly because i actively steer away from that feel. The more it feels rigorous, the less i like it, and the more it feels competitive, the less i like it. The rules are, for me, usually a necessary evil, occasionally a useful aid, but never the structure of the game, or the most important part.  In fact, it would be fair to say that, for the most part, the rules are there for the other players, because otherwise they won't play with me. RPGing is always collaborative storytelling; if it starts to feel like a game, however, something is going wrong.

Do all games have winners and losers?  Do they all have unforeseeable outcomes?  Do all games emphasize rules over tools?  I don't think debating those questions would provide much benefit other than to incidentally find out what others mean when they use the word, and that benefit goes barely any farther than the one particular conversation.<br/><br/>I might call "house" a game if a better word didn't instantly pop to mind, but I don't <i>think</i> about it the same way I think about activities I'd call games more readily.  The kids are certainly playing (roleplaying, even), but other than the occassional argument about what should happen next, they aren't trying to win anything.  There aren't any formal rules, and the informal ones are made up on the spot, hence the occassional argument.  There are no end conditions, nor any is there an agreed-upon goal.  Not all the participants are even supposed to have fun, because the entire "play session" may be someone else's turn to have fun.<br/><br/>But it's still a lot easier to call it a game than a "play session."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Addendum:  All of my D&amp;D3.5 experiences I would consider games.  They were, in fact, very Gamist in nature.  Although power gains were as often a tool for maintaining illusion as for rewards, the focus for the players was on who could use their character's resources to necessitate the greatest twist in what we expected the DM's planned storyline to be (with props given to risk-takers).  So there was competitive tension between the players and each other and between the players and the DM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_87498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87498/#Comment_87498" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-11T09:00:45+00:00" title="August 11, 2007  9:00AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just a quick note about this thread: I don't mind people discussing semantics, identity politics, theoretical definitons of the term "game" etc if they want to - but what I'm really after are (short) examples of role-playing experiences, and what people would call those experiences.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87506/#Comment_87506" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-11T09:35:45+00:00" title="August 11, 2007  9:35AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there's a real difference between toys and games.<br/><br/>Greg Costikyan's <a href="http://www.costik.com/nowords.html" rel="nofollow">definition</a> of game: "A game is a form of art in which participants, termed players, make decisions in order to manage resources through game tokens in the pursuit of a goal."<br/><br/>In RPGs, goals have an extremely open scope, The goal can be "leveling up" or "amassing gold," but it can also be "killing the dragon," "finding the lost kingdom," or "overcoming my self-destructive impulses and reconnecting with my son."<br/><br/>All my RPG experiences are games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_87590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/woodelf" title="woodelf"><img alt="woodelf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/woodelf">woodelf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87590/#Comment_87590" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-12T01:22:04+00:00" title="August 12, 2007  1:22AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>Yeah, there's a meaningful gap between "I'm playing with my Legos" and "You want to play Legos?"</blockquote>\nIs there?

Toys are the building blocks of games. I suspect that for our purposes, though, a goal must be understood by the participating group, implicitly or explicitly if there's to be a game. It's not enough to set your own goal and accomplish it, in secret, without the rest of the group ever knowing or caring. They don't necessarily have to be formalized or spoken by the group, but they have to be understood. In general, I've found that games tend to be better when goals are explicitly laid out in the form of flags.<br/><br/>If my goal is "overcoming my self-destructive impulses and reconnecting with my son," the rest of the group has to know that on some level so they can both witness that journey and provide adversity to it (even if only one of them is providing the adversity).<br/><br/>I think this discussion has always been in Creative Agenda territory. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87609/#Comment_87609" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-12T08:07:37+00:00" title="August 12, 2007  8:07AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>Is there?

Shreyas' "Do you want to play Legos?" not only implies more than one person but that they are <em>engaged in some form of directed activity</em> called Legos. <br/><br/>In this line of reasoning "playing Legos" is different from "playing with Legos" because it is the <big>opposite</big> of what you describe below:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: woodelf</cite>it was still pretty much aimless, with minimal conflict, no meaningful conflict, and no real point.</blockquote>\nand as your post articulates the difference between the two it implies there is one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_87689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87689/#Comment_87689" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-12T19:38:43+00:00" title="August 12, 2007  7:38PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>No, I'm specifically talking about engaging in shared activity as opposed to lonelyfun.

This was longer than six months ago, in fact about a year ago, but it stands out as an example.  It was definitely roleplaying.  We'd probably refer to it as a game, even though all the rules were spontaneous and implicit in how each person was playing.  I would define it as play, not a game, since I require some structure for something to be a game.<br/><br/>However, if game and play are synonyms for an activity that exists in a trinity: work, art, play, then it would definitely be a game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_87953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87953/#Comment_87953" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-14T02:45:01+00:00" title="August 14, 2007  2:45AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>No, I'm specifically talking about engaging in shared activity as opposed to lonelyfun.

So there's a meaningful difference in the game-ness of an activity, when the only change you make is the number of people involved? So a solo activity can't be a game? Solitaire doesn't qualify? Or am i now misreading you?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
