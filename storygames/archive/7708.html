They might be high magic, they might have ca-razy races or the like, but in the end most of the setting seems downright normal, compared to some fantasy anime/manga/books that I've been seeing lately.<br/><br/>For example, looking at my favorite anime, 12 Kingdoms:<br/><br/>*The sky is overhead. <i>Above the sky</i> is a giant ocean. There are some mountains that are so high they stick out above the sea even.<br/>*Animals and people are not born from mothers: They are all born from trees. Animals from "animal trees", people from "people trees", in these kinds of egg-sacks. There are rules about how to summon a baby to be born from a tree.<br/>*Kings/queens are selected by unicorns (unicorn-people, actually), one unicorn per kingdom. They are granted immortality for their rule. If they become corrupt, or their reign offends the heavens, the unicorn will suffer an illness and die, and the king/queen shortly afterwords.<br/>*The shape of the land is a perfectly symmetrical shape:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.clho.net/anime/twelve/12-map.jpg"/><br/>* There's also monsters, some of which can be controlled/bound through magic, but that's not that unusual for fantasy.<br/><br/>From there, there's lots of cultural quirks, most seeped in Chinese history/fantasy (most leaders/nobility have two or more names, their "real name" and their "public name", the organization of the government, etc).<br/><br/>So, the thing is, I'm like, "How can *I* come up with stuff like that", the "weird" stuff.  I mean, it sounds easy and all, "OK, so there's an ocean above the sky!", but I'm wondering if there's some sort of mental exercise one can come up with to basically turn up the Strange? Some sort of brainstorming that can result in ideas like that?<br/><br/>I have no problems coming up with cool quirky cultures, magic effects, and general cosmological quirks ("heaven/hell works like this", "this is how the Gods work", etc), but having problems with making genuinely unique-yet-simple-sounding things.<br/><br/>Any creative writing tips that could help here?<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171207/#Comment_171207" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-25T09:17:46+00:00" title="September 25, 2008  9:17AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Skimming through my planescape collection (and later, mimir.net) used to do it for me.  <br/><br/>Then I made a random cosmology generator, and it was so sweet... six-armed guys running around on forests which were themselves rooted on continent-sized leaves of the vines that had been draped over a dead world-tree ... but then I lost the tables.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171213/#Comment_171213" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-25T09:34:05+00:00" title="September 25, 2008  9:34AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wonder if some random pairing might work well?<br/><br/>If I take some features about the world and pair random words with them, they'll probably create some bizarre images.<br/><br/>Sky: <i>Railway</i><br/>Born: <i>Music</i><br/>Kings and Queens: <i>Asteroid</i><br/>Land: <i>Bipedal</i><br/><br/>Taking that all literally, there's a land where the sky is crisscrossed by railways, taking people from place to place; people are born of music; it's ruled by sentient lumps of rock; and the land itself walks about the world.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171214/#Comment_171214" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-25T09:36:01+00:00" title="September 25, 2008  9:36AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My roommates were watching 12 kingdoms and what struck me was how much internal logic the world had and how it all became fucked up with drama.

The king must travel the land, gaining the vote of each druid in turn.  But one king traveled the land, killing any druid who wouldn't give him their vote.  So, a spirit was bonded to those who sought kingship and even if they did not obtain the crown, they were bonded for life.<br/><br/>This is how our nobles gained such insight into the spirit world and how so many of noble blooded ended up being half spirit, many kings and would-be kings mated with the spirits bonded to them to keep them from gaining druidic choice by force.</i><br/><br/>So, start simple, complicate it with sex, passion, hubris, murder and so on.

I've found myself getting really annoyed at some of the stuff that's come out of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Weird" rel="nofollow">"New Weird"</a> writers.  Sometimes they work, sometimes they really, really don't.<br/><br/>Going the route Ryan describes (random tables) might be a good place to start, but I think a big part of cosmology is its underlying truth and meaning.  Cosmologies come out of attempts to understand things at the largest scale possible: cosmos + logos = encompassing the universe in words, and I think a truly "throw everything and see what sticks" process doesn't produce truly meaningful cosmologies.<br/><br/>Weird is fine, but I think cosmologies work because they have an underlying worldview or viewpoint - a truth.  What does it Mean-with-a-capital-M.  The "everything comes from the trees" world you mentioned is a wonderful one, but I think it works because it seems to have a certain viewpoint.  One that comes to mind is that everything in that universe has a place. Even the leaders are chosen by a natural process, and their failures are dealt naturally (they sicken and die, making room for the next one). That, in turn, fits wonderfully with the perfectly-symmetrical land.  It's ordered, not in a clockwork fashion, but rather something closer to the natural balance of an ecosystem, expanded to cover even things like politics and geography.<br/><br/>I guess what I'm trying to say is that I think a truly great/interesting cosmology comes from the mashup of some truly weird elements connected by an interesting, underlying truth.  Upping the Weird for its own sake can give you a "wow" factor, but ultimately come off as meaningless.<br/><br/>Just my $0.02. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>-d-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171222/#Comment_171222" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-25T10:05:08+00:00" title="September 25, 2008 10:05AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Andy, I suspect the secret to this is to be someone like Judd or Vincent or Fuyumi Ono.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/boulet" title="boulet"><img alt="boulet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/534/nTWF4B3HT5CT6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/boulet">boulet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171227/#Comment_171227" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-25T10:20:19+00:00" title="September 25, 2008 10:20AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the collision method : take two elements which don't need to be related to one another, collide them, create correlations, melt/substitute/switch colors and flavors.

I could start toying mentally with a society of mercantile people engaged in overseas trade who have a tendency to interpret signs in some irrational way. Or I could try to use the weird phobic relationship Dali had with womanhood to sparkle a trait of my fictional setting, making parallels with the fact that Minoans seemed to worship mostly female deities.  <br/><br/>My $0.02 approach                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171269/#Comment_171269" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-25T12:36:51+00:00" title="September 25, 2008 12:36PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 25, 2008 12:37PM by J_Walton.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's surrealist fantasy and then there's like, anthropological fantasy.  The former has really crazy shit just for weirdness sake and the latter has stuff in it that real people in the real world might actually believe or have believed to be true.  There's a huge spectrum in the middle too, yeah?  Like, an ocean above the sky?  Totally reasonable.  That's why the sky is blue.  That's where rain drips from.  Etc.  While surrealist fantasy comes, yeah, from the juxtaposition of seemingly incongruent elements, anthropological fantasy comes from observations of real world cultures, either done by the authors or second hand through reading and research on mythology and belief systems and culture and art and the like.<br/><br/>For example, in the Four Nations setting that me, Shreyas, and Thomas Robertson were working on a few years back, dead people journey after death to the land of the dead on foot.  Like, they got up from their death bed, packed a few things, said goodbye to their loved ones, and set off towards the place where dead people lived.  Those who were too attached to their mortal life to leave, the folks who hung around tormenting the living, those were ghosts.  And, for me, that was inspired by this story I read:\n<blockquote>Long ago, the living [tso] could see the dead [ne], and the dead could see the living. Living and dead both attended the market: one that side of the street the dead sold their things; on this side the living sold theirs; and the dead took the same form as the living. At that time, they used copper money, not paper. The dead used paper to stamp out coins that looked just like the copper coins of the living, and with this money they bought things from the living. But the living were not to be trifled with. They put the coins in a pan of water: the real coins made of copper sank, and the paper coins made by the dead floated. They returned the false money to the dead, and gradually the dead could no longer buy from the living; they could buy only from other dead. If your father died, you could go to the market the next day and see him. But it was not permitted for living and dead to speak to each other. The dead were punished if they spoke to the living -- their officials taxed and fined them -- and the living were afriad to speak to the dead. So living and dead could only look at each other. Then, as now, the dead sometimes harmed [ko, literally "bit"] the living, but the living could beat the dead in return, so the dead had no power over them. Disgusted with this situation, the dead petitioned for a bamboo sieve to be set up between themselves and the living. The living could see the dead only vaguely, but the dead [being closer to the sieve's holes] could see the living clearly. The living did not like this, for the sieve was too thick to beat the dead through. The living were stupid: some say they asked for a paper screen to be placed on their side of the street; they could beat the dead through the paper, but they could not see them at all.</blockquote>\n--  Erik Mueggler, <i>The Age of Wild Ghosts</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171299/#Comment_171299" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-25T13:48:18+00:00" title="September 25, 2008  1:48PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a suggestion. I haven't tried this but it sounds like it would work.<br/><br/>1. Soak yourself in symbolic stuff. Read a book on Tarot or symbols or symbolic animals or dream interpretation or whatever. Or some strange fantasy (Eddison, David Lindsay, Lord Dunsany in his stranger moments, George Macdonald, Charles Williams) might do it, but it might also predispose you to certain answers. Perhaps read the strange fantasy first, the symbolism stuff afterwards.<br/><br/>2. Incubate it. By this I mean: sit in a comfortable chair and let yourself go off into a dreamlike state. You might even fall asleep. But in any case, let logical thought go, ignore your real environment, just drift off and wander mentally.<br/><br/>3. Your brain produces weirdness like a fruit tree produces fruit.<br/><br/>4. Have pen and paper or a voice recorder at hand so that when you come to from your fugue, you can capture the weirdness before it evaporates.<br/><br/>5.

Or if they're not coming out well, keep doing it for practice.<br/><br/>(This is for "surrealist fantasy", not "anthropological fantasy")                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/joshua%20neff" title="joshua neff"><img alt="joshua neff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.goblin-cartoons.com/images/lantern.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/joshua%20neff">joshua neff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171402/#Comment_171402" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-26T04:22:31+00:00" title="September 26, 2008  4:22AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had a suggestion, but Clinton got there first.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171631">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171631/#Comment_171631" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-26T23:54:01+00:00" title="September 26, 2008 11:54PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another alternative is for someone to create 'How to Host a Cosmogony.' <br/><br/>I have some ideas about how this would work - based on some very rules light games me and a friend ran way back in the late 90s. We basically played some games in which the players each created one of the gods who created a fantasy world. Each picked a domain - these ranged between those that you might expect (war, love, etc) and a few on the ludicrous end of things (one subgenius fan played the god of slack, I believe). We played out turns in which the gods did various things - acts of creation, warring with each other, seducing each other, and so forth. I think we created a map as we went, too. The idea was that we would end up with a world suitable for playing a fantasy game in, although none of the games I recall ever got past the first stage ("gods create world, include many cheap jokes").                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171646/#Comment_171646" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-27T02:30:33+00:00" title="September 27, 2008  2:30AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Something I toyed with recently is the idea that much of Western thought (if that's a valid category at all) is dominated by dualistic thinking.  Whether that's a product of a specific cultural heritage, an innate biological imperative, or whatever, I don't know, but we tend to construct meaning around binary oppositions of concepts, of these "good" and "evil" are the most obvious, but they're kind of fractal in the sense that the closer you look at things, the more binary oppositions appear.  Structuralist (and Post-Structuralist) theorists like to make lists that describe cultural elements like this.  For example:<br/><br/>Nature : Civilization<br/>Woman : Man<br/>Native : White<br/><br/>Would be some of the factors associated with a typical Western film.  Interesting subjects for drama tend to occupy places between these two.  So, from the previous example, Cowboys span the divide between "Nature" and "Civilisation".  "Violence" is an issue that's also problematic to the binaries from the above list (which is arguably why it's such a big theme in Westerns).<br/><br/>So, one way to make an interesting, unusual, and compelling fantasy setting would be to create a list of overarching binaries, for example:<br/><br/>Truth : Lies<br/>Desert : Swamp<br/>Man : Woman<br/>Human : Elf<br/>Direct : Indirect<br/><br/>And then you make play about characters who problematise those divisions, so, for example, Half-Elves, frontier-dwellers, people who can detect lies and create illusions, and so forth.  I think the key to doing this well is to find binary oppositions that make sense to you, even though they're not exactly how we percieve things ourselves, so, for example, we don't usually associate deserts with the concept of truth, but it's easy to see the connection.  Adding fantasy races in there makes things interesting.  The association of Elves with Women, for example, tells you a lot about how elves are percieved. <br/><br/>Flipping any one of the above binaries would produce interesting results as well.  I'd advise against doing this too much, as you want the overarching themes to remain recognisable, but, for example, flipping "Men" and "Women" in the above list really changes the gender roles in your setting.  That's exciting to me.<br/><br/>A more difficult task I think would be trying to construct a culture around a non-binary set of ideas.  I'm not sure how you'd do that, but it would be interesting to try:<br/><br/>Earth : Water : Sky<br/>Stationary : Movement in a direction: Constant change<br/>Woman : Man : Shaman<br/>Trees : Animals : Birds<br/><br/>Or something like that.  I don't think it's perfect, but I think you can come up with some very unusual, very "alien" cultural traits this way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
