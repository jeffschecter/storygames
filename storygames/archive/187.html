                    Stupid Question time! I hope this is in-bounds. The basic jist goes: <br/>
<br/>
I've read quite a bit about Burning Wheel around this corner of the blogosphere, enough so that i'm left wondering what makes it so special. It looks nice and crunchy, and i like me some crunch. <br/>
I undersand that the Belief system is supposed to be quite attractive, but it seems to be fairly traditional, otherwise, to judge from the website's blurbs.<br/>
<br/>
Would you recommend the game? What does it do that makes it worth buying?<br/>
<br/>
How does it compare, in the roughest sense, to the newer crop of indie games such as Dogs (which i have, and love) and the latest things, like Shock (which i'm so buying when it comes out, assuming Joshua isn't charging an arm &amp; leg for it!) and so on?<br/>
<br/>
Does the game work on its own, or does it need to be hacked into the shape everyone seems to enjoy?                </div>

                            We gave up on BW because we're lightweights, so take my comments with a grain of salt.  <br/><br/>The whole beliefs, instincts, and traits element is really great, providing clear flags about what the players think is important and driving play.  As a GM it is very easy to structure a session based on hitting BITs.  <br/><br/>Character generation is super fun in a crunchy way, time consuming but rewarding.  If you are into elves, dwarves, and orcs BW's take on them is stellar.  The duel of wits mechanic can be lots of fun.  The books are attractively laid out and reasonably priced for sure.  That's all great.  <br/><br/>My group spent <em>ages</em> trying to make BW combat work for us and totally failed.  We found that the scripting system became an unacceptable interruption - it jarred us out of the fun narrative and into an extremely detailed  process none of us enjoyed.  It does what it is supposed to do, once you figure it out, and it turns out that isn't what we wanted.  I found myself as a GM avoiding conflict because the enthusiasm and interest in the group just ground to a halt.  As a note we tried to "fix" the system in various ways and realized that it is a tight package, and tampering with it was not productive at all - take it as is or don't play it.  <br/><br/>Lots of people adore BW and rightly so.  I know there are people here who will scream that I was doing it wrong, that I'm a fucking idiot, etc, and that's cool.  I'm just relaying our experience and hope that is helpful to you.                        </div>

<blockquote>Would you recommend the game?</blockquote>
Gladly.
<blockquote>What does it do that makes it worth buying?</blockquote>
The Belief, Instinct and Trait mechanics and how they tie in to the <em>artha</em> award system are a great engine. <em>Duel of Wits</em> is a neat way to resolve player and/or character conflict without violence. Of course, when that fails, <em>Fight!</em> beckons. <em>Fight!</em> takes a bit of getting used to. It can be nasty, brutish and often short... but it works, for my money. Chargen is really satisfying; the Lifepath system builds enough backstory in to give me a sense of a character that's lived a life, without requiring that I go generate an 8-page back history. Instead, I can flesh that out later with <em>Circles</em>, one of my favourites. Just in terms of the game concepts, I think it's worth the money.
<blockquote>How does it compare, in the roughest sense, to the newer crop of indie games such as Dogs (which i have, and love) and the latest things, like Shock (which i'm so buying when it comes out, assuming Joshua isn't charging an arm &amp; leg for it!) and so on?</blockquote>
Difficult to make a direct comparison. I've found that BW has informed the way I run Dogs and <em>vice versa</em>, and it is without doubt one of the games I keep coming back to, but that may be due to the company I keep. (See below.)
<blockquote>Does the game work on its own, or does it need to be hacked into the shape everyone seems to enjoy?</blockquote>
I disagree with Jason - the mechanics work fine, and can be learnt and applied cumulatively. You don't have to start fighting with <em>Fight!</em>, for example, you can use versus tests instead until you want (effectively) to bring down the pain. Out of the 'box', it comes with all the skeletal system you need to run a medieval fantasy for $25. You and your players will flesh out the skeleton with their character concepts, beliefs, instincts &amp;c, to create a fun world to play in. There's a load of alternate settings, expressed as new sets of Lifepaths, available for download on the BW forum and the new Burning Wiki.<br/><br/>Full disclosure: I'm friends with Luke. For values of 'friends' that include periodically wanting to murder him, particularly at the table. I also help look after the wiki.<br/><br/>- Alexander                        </div>

                            I'm not friends with Luke (not out of choice, we simply have never met), and I haven't actually *played* BW yet. That said, just from the joy I got out of reading it and burning a few characters I got my $25 worth out of it, and once I get out of my AD&amp;D 2e group, I will definitely run BW for my next fantasy game. The benefits of the system have already been explained above, and I would also like to emphasize that the crunchy Fight! mechanics are optional. The book's pretty clear that each group needs to figure out which of the subsystems they will use. I'd also just use versus tests for a while.<br/>
<br/>
There are a couple of other mechanics I really love, especially Circles. It allows players to specifically look for NPCs that fill a certain function, and that enables them to drive the story forward by establishing that those NPC relationships exist in the first place. I can't explain it well, but you'll easily get it when you read the rules.<br/>
<br/>
I also like that there's no coin counting involved, and that all larger purchases are simply handled via Resources rolls.I hate counting coins; that's the kind of detail that hinders rather than helps my involvement in the game world.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the BW support is great. The web site has lots of resources, and questions seem to be answered very quickly.                        </div>

                            Stefan:<br/>
I hope this question is in-bounds as well, as I'd like to ask the same thing about roughly 20 different games myself.<br/>
But BW! Short answer is I'd recommend it very highly. I have the Revised Core books, the Monster Burner, and just yesterday bought the Dark Elves, Under a Serpent Sun, and Jihad print supplements from Luke (those three supplements are also free pdfs on the website, along with a bunch of other play-aids and sample scenarios).<br/>
Before addressing the game in play, though, I feel like I have to mention that the books as physical objects are some of the best that I own. The core and the MB are both perfect bound with matte covers. They have great layout and design, faultless editing (that I can see), and really cool B&amp;W artwork. All of which is just my roundabout way of saying that in my entire collection of hard-copy indie games, BW is my favorite to hold and look at.<br/>
<br/>
Crud. Alexander and Christian beat me to the punch while I was typing. So... everything they said. One thing that I'd like to expand on, though, is that the game functions on multiple levels of complexity. You can run a quick rip and run game with nothing but the bare-bones rules (the... hub?). This is how I believe Luke runs most of his con scenarios; quick and dirty. The book recommends that you move slowly, dipping into all the crunch as needed in play. I think a lot of people disregard that advice, then become frustrated that there's more to learn (Abzu, you need one of those angry demon heads there). I think that's just a feature of BW, though. There's always going to be more to learn. I've played around nine times, and I'm still learning. That's fine with me, though, since I like what I'm learning.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if I would claim to be *friends* with Luke. Can anyone ever really touch the sun?                        </div>

                            Thanks everyone - those are exactly the sort of responses i was looking for. <br/>And it doesn't matter if you're friends with Luke or not, testimonials are testimonials, after all! &gt;_&gt;<br/><br/>With all that justification, i'm pretty much sold.<br/> <br/>I love the names of the rules, and style. <i>Circles</i> sound very interesting - perhaps, something akin to proto-NPCs.<br/><br/>I've seen what pictures they have on the website - Even though i prefer PDFs on principle, those *are* very nice looking books, and really help with the sales pitch!<br/><br/>I'm pretty used to steep learning curves - i also play games like <a href="http://www.adastragames.com/products/adastra/av.html" rel="nofollow">Attack Vector</a> when i can - but i'll try to take it one step at a time, when/if i put together a game.                        </div>

<p>My thoughts echo Jason's... we couldn't take the combat mechanics, and they felt very cognitively dissonant. The layout of the character book doubled the already considerable time it takes to make a character.</p>

                            So the combat mechanics - the scripting system, i assume - seems to be the big sticking point for people.<br/>
<br/>
I take it the problem is that the game basically crashes when everyone has to stop and plan out what they all want to do, as opposed to the back and forth of Dogs. Any other Cons? <br/>

                            I believe the problem is that more people <em>think</em> the game crashes when it comes time to script a <em>Duel of Wits</em> or <em>Fight!</em> combat than have actually tried it out. In practise, scripting either is like a sub-game unto itself, relying on the skills you have, your assessment of the opposition, and how well you know the other player.<br/><br/>To be fair, when you're still learning the system, it can slow down a bit (and you can totally fuck yourself by scripting the wrong action). However, I found the same thing when I first started playing <em>Dogs in the Vineyard</em>: strategising with the dice was not well integrated with, for example, the colour of <em>See</em>s. It took a while; now, it's like breathing. Just as there are neat dice tricks you can do with DitV (like the first time you <em>take the blow</em> with eight tiddler dice that a Dog expected you to block with your big guns... sweet), there are strategies with DoW and Fight! that become apparent after more experience with the system.<br/><br/>You'll fail hard if you blow it: scripting an <em>Incite</em> in a Duel of Wits, then realising you don't have an open skill to use when you get to that volley... well, you can be out of the argument. That's pretty much a mistake that everyone makes. Once.<br/><br/>There's definitely a hump with the conflict mechanics that you need to get over, but they're the heart of the game: compromise, fighting until you can't take any more, blood, guts and Steel. I love it.                        </div>

                            First: What do you want from a fantasy game? I don't recommend stuff in a vaccuum.<br/>
<br/>
Burning Wheel has many cool features, but whether those features are suitable to you, I can't know.<br/>
<br/>
It has no setting for example (it has some setting based assumptions however, which I find at odds with the lack of further exposition of a setting.) Is it good in a vaccum? It is not a spacesuit. What do you like in fantasy game-ing?                        </div>

                            So, i understand that the two biggest points that turn people off of the game are:<br/>
<br/>
1. Script-writing requires a time-consuming  preparation period that breaks the flow of gameplay &amp; narrative<br/>
<br/>
2. Planning scripted-actions requires overcoming a steep learning curve in order to reduce the instances of unforseen major, or even crippling, fallout from action combinations<br/>
<br/>
I imagine that the only real way to ameliorate these points is to *really* study the system, learn as much as you can about the potential outcomes, and make sure everyone accepts that disasters can &amp; will happen. <br/>
<br/>
My history in gaming is largely with GURPs, usually in a highly tactical, crunchy, combat-oriented mode, so i'm used to some aspects of these problems. Not that i terribly like having to deal with them!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks agian for all the commentary - Any other things i should look out for, good, bad, or ugly, in Burning Wheel?                        </div>
