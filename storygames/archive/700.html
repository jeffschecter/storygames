<p>(I won't have a game ready; maybe you will?)</p>
<p>I had the idea of making a small take-home slip of paper, perhaps about business card sized, with the logo for your game on it, obligatory description, and some neat flavor text. If someone wasn't ready to buy the game then and there, they could take the card with them. (Or, if you sold out, or your game is only in PDF format, or not on the shelf, you can still have these cards with you.) This could help a unsure buyer make the purchase later (even if they're not ready at the con). The downside is that LOTS of people will just pick up business cards with only the attention of "collecting" them... but then I guess that's neat too.</p>

                            That might be a good way of doing pre-advertising for your game, too.  <br/><br/>For example, this would be a GREAT way to advertise <i>Decade</i> which is card-based, and then all I have to have ready for GenCon is a playable version online, or even a promo website with a quick-start version.  Plus it only costs $40 to make a whole lot of nice cards.  Genius, Dev!!  Thanks!<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            It'd also be pretty cool if you could sum up the rules or have a mini-game on the back of the card.  Check out: www.vistaprint.com for business cards.  They do a great job and are pretty cheap depending on what you buy.  250 bcs for $15 plus shipping.  They also do magnet business cards which people really like. I have people ask for multiple magnets that I do.  A cool logo, tagline, website listing might end up on someone's fridge.                        </div>

                            It's a solid idea. I know as a Booth Money in the past, I imagined how great it would be NOT for Business Cards, but to hand out "Game Cards": That is, the front has a pic of the game or some sort of figure/smbol from it, and on the back is the website and your name.<br/><br/>With business cardss, they'd just be like, "Who was this guy again? "Happy Elf Studios", what the fuck did they sell?" when they got back home.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            I picked up loads of cards at Spiel, and they were handy when I was writing about it for Realms. I haven't really followed up on many of them though...<br/><br/>However, Andy's right though, Game Cards are much cooler. Especially if they're usable, like a mini pre-gen character and a note to "use this for our booth demo!" That way you might catch folks who just browse around day 1 and will come back for more later.                        </div>

                            Cheapass Games would write a simple fun little game and print that on their business cards.  And the Icehouse people condense the most common rules of their games onto business cards, but accompany the business cards with more complete rules.<br/>
<br/>
There's no reason you couldn't try writing a super condensed rpg and putting it on there as well.  Certainly, I've seen games simple enough to fit on a card.  Or at least putting all the player relevant rules on a single business card, to consult during play, like how old school GM screens had all the GM relevant charts on there.  Then you give away the cards with a basic understanding on the game as a free demo, but they need to purchase it to really understand the game or play.                        </div>

                            As it turns out I've got a bunch of (<em>a bunch of</em>) unique Roach cards that were not used in the game - I had originally planned on offering them in sets of eight as part of a "fun pak" or some nonsense.  The plan now is to hand-stamp them with the Bully Pulpit URL and use them as giveaways you can add to your Roach deck.                        </div>

                            I'd actually recommend against this.  A business card will just get lost, and your "click-through" rate will be negligible -- for every hundred cards you give out, I expect you'd get less than one sale.  If it costs you a couple bucks for a hundred  cards and you make a couple bucks off  a single sale... you can see where I'm going with this.<br/><br/><em>However</em>, there are ways around this and better ways to do this.  The first is what Jason proposes -- ie, he already has these cards lying around and all it's going to cost him is some hand-stamping time.  Also, handing potential customers an artifact from the game rather than an advertisement will actually work better -- we're all very practiced at ignoring advertisements, these days.<br/><br/>Spending a little more money, you can create a mini game or micro game that prints up on something hand-sized that can be given out to people.  If it's a <em>functional</em> thing, they'll be more likely to keep it around, maybe try it out -- even if they never try it, they will be <em>thinking about how they might try it</em>.  That's why the artifacts work better than advertisements.  You'll think about a game card and what else it entails about the whole product; you'll actively dismiss an advertisement from your headspace.  <em>Fireborn</em> did this, although they went a little overboard and did a full-color poster thingy which probably cost more than was cost-effective.<br/><br/>The other thing that anybody with a product at Con should be doing is using character sheets <em>with your freaking URL printed on them</em>.  The one thing that a potential customer is most likely to take away from any gaming table is their character sheet, and if your demo is any good, that character sheet will be invested with memories of entertaining play.  If it also says on that sheet where to get the game, you're golden.                        </div>
