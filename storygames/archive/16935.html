It is, naturally, going to be a website focused on roleplaying/story/whatever games.<br/><br/>The website is projected to be launched mid-October. It has a name, but I'm holding onto that until it's a sure thing.<br/><br/><b>What I want from you: Reviews.</b><br/><br/>While the website will have more than just reviews, that's still being figured out, so I'm not going to announce it here, yet.<br/><br/>I'm looking for a specific kind of review:<br/><br/>1. Based on actual play. No reviews based on reading the game. State how many sessions you played either in your review or directly to me when you send it. You can also review a game multiple times! Play it, review it, come back to it, review it again, if you have a fresh take on it.<br/><br/>2. No scores, no numbers, no stars. This is about reviewing your play experiences, and it's my position on this website that those can't be quantified, and in fact it's unhelpful to try to do so.<br/><br/>3. A review of the <i>game</i>, not of the text. Talk about how the game works when you need to, but don't feel the need to break down the game into its component chapters in the text and examine it that way: you're looking it through the lens of your play experience, nothing else. If we want to know exactly how the game works from beginning to end we can read the game text. When we read your review we should feel what you felt when playing the game. That said, it's fine to talk about the text of the game in your review, especially as it relates to your play. I just don't want bullet-point reviews of the text.<br/><br/>4. For starters, <b>read these reviews</b>: <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/reviews/30/" rel="nofollow">Kill Puppies For Satan</a>, <a href="http://www.actionbutton.net/?p=1227" rel="nofollow">Super Mario 3d Land</a>, <a href="http://gfbrobot.com/2012/01/03/apocalypse-world-an-mcs-review/" rel="nofollow">Apocalypse World</a>, <a href="http://gfbrobot.com/2012/03/05/we-played-polaris-and-now-there-are-none-who-remember-it/" rel="nofollow">Polaris</a>, and <a href="http://gfbrobot.com/2012/07/13/an-intense-review-sorcerer/" rel="nofollow">Sorcerer</a>. They (the last three especially, as they're my reviews) aren't the be-all end-all of great reviews, but they are the kind of thing that I'm shooting for on this website. Rambly is OK. Idiosyncratic is OK. I want reviews that give people a sense of what it's like to play this game, such that they want to go out and play it or avoid it. In my reviews I started adding a "Play This If/ Don't Play This If" section at the end. You don't have to use that format, but do your best to give people enough information and enough of your experience that they'll have a reasonable idea of whether they'd like the game or not. No scores!<br/><br/>5. I'm interested in weird and experimental formats. Comic-as-review (even if you think you can't draw)? Video reviews? A review interspersed with fiction? Yes, please. And more. <br/><br/><br/>So, it comes down to this: <i>Why</i> should you write reviews? For you, I'm not sure. I've personally found that writing a review is really a pretty incredibly enriching and rewarding post-game experience--it forces me to sift through our play and articulate my thoughts about a particular game. It provides a satisfying sense of closure to playing a game. You can make it your own. I used to think about writing reviews, and five minutes trawling through RPG.net's review pages stole away any desire: I didn't want to write that kind of review. So then I found <a href="http://www.actionbutton.net" rel="nofollow">actionbutton.net</a> (video games) and realized I could write reviews however the fuck I wanted to.<br/><br/>Beyond that, I just enjoy critically examining games and game experiences, as well as sharing that with others. Write a review because you like to think about games, you like to stretch yourself, you like to introduce people to new things, and you like to engage in critical dialogue.<br/><br/><b>If you are writing a review, send submissions of at least 800 words to me at hcotterson at g male. If you're doing a comic or another funky format, don't worry about the word count</b> (There'll be a better process once the website is up and running).<br/><br/>Submission isn't a guarantee that it'll get posted, but if it doesn't look like the right fit we'll be in dialogue and no one will steal your words. You can send a shorter, tentative draft to me if you're interested in posting but not sure that you're "doing it right". Hint: you probably are, but I'll look at those, too. I'll edit your submissions, but you'll get to approve the edits before I post 'em, if you want to.<br/><br/>Again, the website will launch (projected) in mid-October, so your review won't show up until then. I'd like to open with a bang, though!<br/><br/>Any questions?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_385711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385711/#Comment_385711" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-24T19:37:34+00:00" title="July 24, 2012  7:37PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eagerly awaiting.

How the text impacts the experience of play seems extremely pertinent (as in "it was awesome once we figured it out but we wasted an hour jumping back and forth between pages trying to decipher what we were supposed to be doing"). Lots of games are effectively oral traditions (you were taught to play by someone instead of learning from the text), which is great if you have access to those teachers but doesn't help anyone else out in the wide world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_385712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385712/#Comment_385712" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-24T19:41:09+00:00" title="July 24, 2012  7:41PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Ben, thanks for asking about that.

Plus I like writing and reading long reviews. I don't want it to be a bite-sized review site ("bite-sized" and "review" almost seem like oxymorons to me). To be totally transparent and show how unoriginal I am, my first model-inspiration for this site has been <a href="http://www.actionbutton.net" rel="nofollow">actionbutton.net</a>, who write what I think are the best goddamn reviews of games (videogames) I've ever read. They also write looooong reviews (like a 13,000 word FFXIII review). So that's where I'm coming from, at least initially.<br/><br/>But: A few people have been having issues with that, saying it hampers their interest and involvement in this endeavour.

If comics reviews start becoming a thing with momentum, then maybe I'll have some better criteria for them regarding length.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_385959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/StuMc" title="StuMc"><img alt="StuMc" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/StuMc">StuMc</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385959/#Comment_385959" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-29T23:07:08+00:00" title="July 29, 2012 11:07PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That Apocalypse World review is awesome!<br/><br/>You have a gift sir and I'm looking forward to seeing your site. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Stu.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_385961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385961/#Comment_385961" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-29T23:54:41+00:00" title="July 29, 2012 11:54PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, thanks Stu!
