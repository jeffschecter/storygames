It's a traditional RPG like DnD, except there are more exceptions, etc. I knew once this game, but I really know nothing about the new edition which is a total overhaul. There aren't enough GMs and for personal reasons I really would like to help by GMing.<br/><br/>The problem is, that the adventure to be played will most probably have crucial points where system should be used (such as fights and magic - with huge spell lists OMG) and the <del>GM</del> game and most probably the adventure, too, will lack any help for the GMs (such as the threat level is in DnD).<br/><br/>On the other hand the number of GMs is scarce, because four parties sent their applications after the deadline. The developers didn't want to include them, but the publisher is pushing them, so they must GM them. I think that this means that some compromises are acceptable.<br/><br/>I'm curious if anyone has any advice to me. Shall I insist to GM to a late party and tell them (before or afterwards) that because of this they will have / had a less valuable session (not with these words)? How much should I dare to change the adventure to my likings to make it easier to GM?<br/><br/>Any ideas are welcome. Even the stupidest ones, so please don't hesitate. Thanks.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208094/#Comment_208094" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-19T08:09:16+00:00" title="May 19, 2009  8:09AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know someone who was a little familiar with Magus, but I don't think he's knowledgable about the recent edition. <br/><br/>I would suggest that players who sign up have an agreement with you that you're running _that game_. You might run a better game, but they may well be signing up to get a taste for the new edition (that would be a motivation of mine, anyway).<br/><br/>Why is the publisher pushing people...?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208098/#Comment_208098" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-19T08:23:08+00:00" title="May 19, 2009  8:23AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joe Murphy</cite>Why is the publisher pushing people...?</blockquote>I think even I can guess at this one.
