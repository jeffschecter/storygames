No GM. I facilitated but jumped in to play a character. I had deliberately not read all the scene descriptions up front but tried to play it "from the text". After 1 hour warm up (talking about setting, expectations and trying out the rules) and 3 hours play we got through 5 scenes. A GM may be able to pace it quicker - but to play it in 'a single short session' is a bit optimistic. We have scheduled another session for the second part. Characters in play: Conductor, Engineman, Quiet Man, Adjudant, Countess. We took our turns within each scene quite loosely.<br/><br/>Stuff that worked well:<br/>* Resolution cards. Be sharp on the task to achieve and when to go for the resolution card - giving the card to another player to interprete is a fun trust builder.<br/><br/>Stuff that worked ok:<br/>* Fate cards. They got the story moving - but deciding when to draw and how to interpret it to match both character and story element was sometimes difficult. Advice: Earlier in a scene is better than later.<br/>* Story elements: Delegating ownership of the train, the passengers and the outsiders explicitly to a single player is powerful - the abstract ones are more difficult to combine with fate cards - but will bring violence, fear and loyalty into the game.<br/>* Try in a different way: Replaying a scene is powerful - but can also throw the player down a less interesting path.<br/>* Scene text and ideas for things to throw in the scene.<br/><br/>Stuff that could be made stronger:<br/>* Initial characters relations could be stronger and requires players to push for them to evolve rather than settle.<br/>* Creating and resolving a secret for each character is much work and takes time.<br/>* Hitting the character destinies requires much focus for each player and reduces focus on the other player's destinies. <br/>* Pretty Girl is not very interesting for character development.<br/><br/>Notes on playing GM-less:<br/>* Having someone to know the overarcing plot before and gently steering the fiction could have been useful. We had to retrofit a bit. That might not have been a GM though - just having one player read all the scenes before could help.<br/>* Having the support of a GM to develop the character destinies could be helpful.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261100/#Comment_261100" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-09T23:39:47+00:00" title="March  9, 2010 11:39PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Frederik, when you used "try a different way", did you replay the entire scene?

This gave a more serious tone - which I liked. I understand that the technique can also be used to just change a detail - however, this filtering process often takes place anyway during the idea brainstorm for e.g. interpreting fate cards.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261445">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261445/#Comment_261445" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-11T10:53:25+00:00" title="March 11, 2010 10:53AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for these notes, Frederik. I've never run the game GMless and I was pretty confident it would work, so your feedback on what went well - and not so well - is quite valuable. <br/><br/>Were your character secrets open or closed? What would you recommend in terms of revising secrets and destinies? <br/><br/>Some of your observations may be group-specific - I've seen the Pretty Girl become the hub of the action twice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frederik%20J.%20Jensen" title="Frederik J.
