Fastaval 2012 is April 4 - 8 in Hobro, Denmark.<br/><br/>I find the selection of games very good this year which makes it difficult to decide which ones to sign up for. Per Fischer's Crossroads (inspired by Sorcerer) and Asbj\xf8rn Olsen's Cracked (do I sense Bliss Stage here?) triggers my story game nerve, but I am also tempted to sign up for the classic intrigue scenario The Executioners and Alex Uth's Denmark noir crime drama Tracked.<br/><br/>Finally, don't forget the Indie Block Sunday afternoon where Eppy will run Swords without Masters.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.fastaval.dk/program-events/?lang=en" rel="nofollow">Browse the complete program</a>.<br/><br/>(and yes - this year Fastaval is fully in English (or at least Danglish) - you can sign up in English - and a lot of games will run with English groups).<br/><br/>Which games are you exited about?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360505/#Comment_360505" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-19T04:49:11+00:00" title="February 19, 2012  4:49AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 19, 2012 4:49AM by Emily_Care.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In addition to those, I'm excited about playing <a href="http://www.fastaval.dk/tiny-liverpool/?lang=en" rel="nofollow">Tiny Liverpool</a> by Mikkel B\xe6kgaard, a story about two from a small industrial town in Denmark and how life dashes their dreams. Two pairs of players play the brothers as young men, two as old. And <a href="http://www.fastaval.dk/the-day-the-door-opens/?lang=en" rel="nofollow">The Day the Door Opens</a>, a dark humor comedy set in a British crime thriller. Eppy &amp; I will also be GMing Evan Torner's <a href="http://www.fastaval.dk/metropolis/?lang=en" rel="nofollow">Metropolis</a> , which lets the players act out the story of the Fritz Lang film. My favorite part about this game is playing the city--when players are not a character in  particular scene they get to enact the elements of the city itself, which reflect and heighten what is happening in the story. It's a beautiful evocation of the way the image carries emotion and meaning in<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Expressionism" rel="nofollow">German expressionism</a> in films.<br/><br/>Can't wait!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
