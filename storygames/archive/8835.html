I've got what I think is a pretty good manuscript, and I'm currently working on a second revision of it, but I'm not stupid enough to think that I can catch all the mistakes and inconsistencies that get slipped in there while I am away from my computer. Any volunteers or recommendations? I'm writing in English English as opposed to American English, if that makes any difference to anyone. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I am stupid enough to think that I can do the layout myself. Is this a mistake? I've got no experience but I have been reading up on the subject (I've read the Non-Designer's Design Book and I'm reading this odd little book on typography). I think I can do it. What kind of things do amateur layout designers usually get wrong?<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nMark                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece" title="Brennen Reece"><img alt="Brennen Reece" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece">Brennen Reece</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195525/#Comment_195525" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-04T16:28:49+00:00" title="March  4, 2009  4:28PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mark,<br/><br/>It would be a mistake to think that you'll get professional results from your first attempt at layout, even if you are really reading up on it. I think the best you can hope for is that your layout won't completely suck. I know people with degrees in graphic design who have been working in the industry for several years, and their layouts still suck. I guess it depends on how professional you want your game to look. You should use a designer with a proportional amount of skill/experience.<br/><br/>As far as newbie design mistakes:<br/><br/>Using a typeface because it looks cool<br/>Not using a grid<br/>Not using enough white space<br/>Using fonts that come pre-installed on your computer<br/>Using free fonts designed by amateur type designers<br/>The text size is too large<br/>Poor kerning in display text<br/>Arbitrary sizes and spacing with both columns, margins, gutters, callouts, and images<br/>Text line length is too wide<br/>Centering headings<br/><br/>...just off the top of my head.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195529/#Comment_195529" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-04T16:43:39+00:00" title="March  4, 2009  4:43PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mark, you can absolutely lay out your own book, just don't expect it to look all glitzy and slick.

If you can afford the time, do the layout, then put it aside and come back to it later. As later as possible, with fresh eyes. Even a few days of distance can be great.<br/><br/>There is no shame in copying page construction from someone else. Find a book that has good layout, bust out your ruler, and measure. Line length, margins, type size, everything. Classic layouts are classic for a reason.<br/><br/>Don't use a typeface that was designed in the last 10 years unless you are a huge type geek and know what's good.

Gary Gygax managed to share his ideas with the world and his layout was the worst. A number of fairly "classic" indie games have really strange layouts that I feel do injustice to the text, but I still play the games and have a great time. Embrace the "do it yourself" thing if that's what you want, if layout isn't something you care about.<br/><br/>On the other hand, layout isn't just about "pretty." It's about clear presentation. Great layout can make your game easier to understand and play.<br/><br/>Figure out what is important to you, the creator, and prioritize your time, energy, and money.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray" title="Tim_Gray"><img alt="Tim_Gray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray">Tim_Gray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195696/#Comment_195696" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-05T15:14:37+00:00" title="March  5, 2009  3:14PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There was a recent thread on RPGnet about editing and layout; specifically, whether those things being not so good would stop people buying stuff. General consensus was that we could all think of books that had problems, and we wished general quality standards were higher, but the RPG-buying public (online at least) don't actually care that much about these things so long as the product has good stuff they can use.<br/><br/>Anyway. If you want to learn how to do layout you have to start doing it and try things out and gradually get better. If you want it to be good from the start, get someone in.<br/><br/><br/>Don't use Arial/Helvetica or Times New Roman as your body font. They're good fonts but people are overexposed to them (and Arial is really bland). Somebody said don't use free fonts that come pre-installed - actually some of those can be quite good, but you need to get an idea of which to trust. *In general* serif fonts are preferred for body text as being easier to read - you can have sans serif body text, but it needs to be picked more carefully. (I've published books in Gill Sans, which worked for them.) Fonts have different feels even if they look quite similar. Try setting up a document with a paragraph of text formatted in various different fonts, print it out and see what each block says to you.<br/><br/>Don't pick a font that doesn't have the right embedding permissions and end up redoing your whole design partway through.<br/><br/>Do use enough white space so that stuff doesn't look crammed together.<br/><br/>Switch off end of line hyphenated word breaks. (And if possible hunt down the people who invented them.)<br/><br/>Left justified/ragged right text is easier to follow than fully justified.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195702/#Comment_195702" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-05T15:32:46+00:00" title="March  5, 2009  3:32PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 5, 2009 3:33PM by Josh Roby.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tim Gray</cite>Don't use Arial/Helvetica or Times New Roman as your body font.

That allows you to get the PDF printed and allows you to update the book when and if you have need.  In InDesign especially, there's a menu option to create a nice little package of all the files and dropped-in images and everything.<br/><br/>I might also advise getting the entire text in XML and have the InDesign file use the XML as source, so you could update the XML with a text editor at your leisure and then the InDesign would update automatically.  But I'm a stickler for archival value, and for most indie game purposes XML isn't a valuable use of anybody's time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soviet" title="soviet"><img alt="soviet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/715/nBVUFTQIKLVIT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soviet">soviet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195937/#Comment_195937" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-06T12:46:30+00:00" title="March  6, 2009 12:46PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think I could pass for a student anymore I'm afraid :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195950/#Comment_195950" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-06T13:38:12+00:00" title="March  6, 2009  1:38PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: soviet</cite>The way I see it is that I'm making an object.

People would cry when they used it, but you would have to sell it for $100,000 (and hope to sell ten) to recuperate your costs. You'd probably lose a million dollars and no one would buy it or play it and know how wonderful it is.<br/><br/>You could spend a day and no money up front to make it, and it would probably be an ugly text document you printed out of Notepad and stapled in the upper, left corner and sold at cons. Every dollar you charged would be profit. You could sell it for 25 cents. At such a cheap price, maybe you'd sell hundreds or even thousands of them. Lots of people would enjoy your game.<br/><br/>Somewhere between those two extremes is the right answer for you and your product. Every production choice you make will come with costs and benefits, which you must weigh.<br/><br/>Remember, the first edition of Dungeons and Dragons looked like crap, and it sold thousands of copies and started a gaming revolution.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195951/#Comment_195951" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-06T13:39:18+00:00" title="March  6, 2009  1:39PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Roby</cite>but<em>if you are a student</em>, buy a copy of Adobe Creative Suite, which includes InDesign.

Every semi-competent painting or building adheres to one, either consciously or not (if you guys want to argue this, let's take it somewhere else). There are tons of books about grid systems in design, and you owe it to yourself to read one or two of them. Note that these aren't just equally spaced squares, but proportionally spaced columns and baselines.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clyde%20L.%20Rhoer" title="Clyde L.
