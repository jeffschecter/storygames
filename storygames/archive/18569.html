A group of friends on vacation in Japan are arrested because they are suspected to have killed the Emperor. None of them speak Japanese, the guard doesn't speak their language well. They are pressured to either confess or to implicate someone else. It's not about whodunnit, but rather about what the group will do to deal with the situation.<br/><br/>It will be our first larp of that type and I've never GMed a larp before. I do GM 'normal' RPGs, though, and my players will mostly be experienced roleplayers.<br/><br/>Has anyone here played that particular game before and has some advice? Or does something stick out for you that you would or wouldn't do? Since the GM doubles as the guard in the game, I would leave the group alone for part of the game when I'm taking the players out of the cell one by one. I'm not sure about that - ok, I'd be just next door in another room, but it feels a bit weird to leave my players on their own. Or am I just being overprotective?<br/><br/>I won't have eight players, so some characters won't be in the game. Would you make sure to have the real killer in the game or leave it to chance?<br/><br/>Any suggestions or advice are very welcome.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417596/#Comment_417596" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-01T07:01:07+00:00" title="July  1, 2013  7:01AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems like there are some warm-up exercises already baked in, with the ball of yarn and whatnot.

Some players might be irked by that setup. Though I'd be okay with it if I knew it was random. (You don't have to tell them upfront, but you can tell them afterwards.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417602/#Comment_417602" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-01T11:03:56+00:00" title="July  1, 2013 11:03AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, good catch.

There is another character who may or may not have been a part of the plan, so there's a good chance that one of those characters will be in the game. So I'll leave it to chance. <br/><br/>As for leaving the players alone: I don't really worry about the game coming to a halt, they will probably be hard to stop once they get going. I do worry about something happening, like someone needing to stop the game for some reason, while I'm out of the room. Yes, my players will be able to manage that by themselves, too, but I'm not completely comfortable with the thought. I will definitely make sure that I'll be able to hear what's going on. <br/>But now that I've written it down, yeah, I might be overprotective.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
