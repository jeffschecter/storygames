This year we have about the same number of games, divided about equally between RPGs, board and card games, and miniatures games. We also already have $1300 in prizes and expect this to increase by several hundred dollars by the end of the week. There is no charge at all for the event, though you can get an extra raffle ticket by bringing a non-perishable food donation for <a href="http://www.northwestharvest.org/" rel="nofollow">Northwest Harvest</a>.<br/><br/>We will be running events from 1pm to 5pm on Saturday November 17 (the Saturday before Thanksgiving); set-up can start as early as noon and packing can go as late as 6pm. The event takes place at <a href="http://www.thirdplacecommons.org/" rel="nofollow">Third Place Commons</a>, located at 17171 Bothell Way NE in Lake Forest Park. There is a fancy food court on the premises.  :-)  <br/><br/>We believe our participants will be even happier than last year, as we have worked on ways to make it easier to find specific games and keeping the game tables for gamers only.  We will have local "gamer celebs" Wolfgang Baur and Erik Scott de Bie running games, and we have a good choice of games, new and old, indie and traditional. You can download the draft program from our Website and read the detailed game descriptions. We hope our event will rock your socks off, so come out and play!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
