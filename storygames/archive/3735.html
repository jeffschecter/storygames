The players were me, Lindsey, Mark, Joshua, Seth, and Andy as GM.  Interesting thing was that noone, including Andy, had ever actually played the game.  This made for some delays before and during play that wouldn't have been there had the game been familiar to everyone.  Still, the mechanics are simple enough and communicating how to do stuff didn't take long.<br/><br/>The Set-up:  Recently the Ark had opened its doors and started setting up outposts and villages in the areas surrounding it.  It had established trade relations with several existing villages in the area.  One such village had just discovered a rich vein of iron in their mine.  The Citadel and the Ark were both interested in profitable trade arranges with this village and had established good relations with the headman of the village.  Unknown to any of the parties involved, a Misbegotten had taken residence in the mine and  a group of Dragon Cultists had infiltrated the community in order to cause enough pain and suffering to coax their master from the depths of the Sea of Mists.<br/><br/>The Characters:  I don't remember the name of any character except Helena.  All I remember are the roles and who played what.  I'm a sad, sad person. :-(<br/><br/>The Headman's Daughter, Helena - Lindsey<br/>The Village Hero - Me<br/>The Citadel Overseer - Joshua<br/>Dragon Cultist Infiltrator - Mark<br/>The Blessed Traveler - Seth<br/>The Headman<br/>The Ark Overseer<br/>The Mine Foreman<br/>The Dragon Cultist Leader<br/>The Misbegotten<br/><br/>The Story (in brief):  The Headman had to go away to handle some emergency or another.  This left Helena in charge and the Citadel Overseer thought he could intimidate more concessions for the Citadel with the daughter instead of the father in charge.  During his talk with Helena a group of miners approached with the dead body of one of their companions.  He had been brutally killed.  The village hero tried to keep the body away from the Citadel folk but the Overseer overrode him and took charge of the investigation.   At this point lots of things started to happen and their order and who did what are fuzzy in my mind.  So I'm going to give a list of significant events and let it go from there.\n<ul>\n<li>The Infiltrator (The Overseer's Secretary)  examined the body and found a message to himself in the mangled corpse.<br/></li><li>The Blessed found out from the Infiltrator that some "master" was to be awakened.<br/></li><li> The Blessed and the Hero went into the mines to deal with the Misbegotten there.<br/></li><li> Helena stood up to the Overseer and put him in his place, establishing herself as the rightful authority in the village.<br/></li><li> The Infiltrator convinces the Overseer to leave the village before the Dragon is awakened.<br/></li><li> The Overseer convinces Helena to go with him to the Citadel to train her burgeoning skills as a stateswoman.<br/></li><li> The Dragon is awakened.<br/></li><li> The Hero and the Blessed fight the dragon and prevail but the Hero dies.<br/></li></ul>\nThoughts:  LoA is a nifty system.  Andy described it as "The dirtiest hippie game at GPSE where all conflicts are resolved with a group hug."  While that doesn't mean there isn't a solid conflict resolution system in place (there is) it does capture the essence that LoA is a highly collaborative game.  It actually reminded me a lot of our PTA game in terms of collaboration over setting and characters.<br/><br/>My biggest frustration with our session was that no one was an expert on the rules; however, I knew that going into the game.  It just slows things down when you have to stop and look up rules.  That is totally not a hit on the game or Andy and it was generally only an issue during the first half of the session.  The last hour or two we had figured out how to do stuff and the session rolled right along.<br/><br/>My favorite moment of the game was when Helena put the Citadel Overseer firmly in his place.  Lindsey (Helena's player) is very new to role-playing but the system really backed up her play and enforced the fact that she had won the conflict.  This is why I am a firm believer in systems resolving social conflict and not just role-playing it out.  It allowed a more soft-spoken, newer player to play a character firmly without fearing that a stronger personality was going to dominate play.  I'll note that even Joshua, who played the Overseer, seemed to really like that moment when he had to adjust in his head how the Overseer perceived the daughter.  It rocked.<br/><br/>LoA uses a clock face symbology in it's resolution mechanic.  The problem is that I can't remember what Sext and Nonce and the rest of the terms mean.  So we just made our own hierarchy of names and went with those.  It made sense to us at the time.  It's probably the biggest thing we changed about the game.  Otherwise we tried to stick as close to the rules as we could, given our unfamiliarity with them.<br/><br/>I hope some of the other players with chime in here with their perception of the game.  Also, feel free to ask questions.  I know I've left lots of stuff out but if you have a specific question, I'll try to answer it.<br/><br/>~Andrew                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84018/#Comment_84018" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-30T08:14:09+00:00" title="July 30, 2007  8:14AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Andrew, thanks for creating this AP post! I'm notoriously bad at putting these things together.<br/><br/>The Set-Up part was interesting. I wanted to do as suggested in the book, by basically reading off the major features of the land (Citadel, Ark, Wasteland), and first decide where to set it.  Since it was really early, I provided a few ideas, and we generally agreed on "A Village Between the Ark and the Citadel".  That's my favorite place to be, a place where there's a clash between two cultures.<br/><br/>The clash, of course, can be forced by putting something in the town that Both Sides Want. In this case, a rich vein of iron ore. I came up with this one.<br/><br/>Then, to get things started, it's cool to pull something out of left field. I decided to throw in Dragon Cultists, because hell, they're like Nazis but Eviler. And more powerful, but that's another story.<br/><br/>So to kick things off I started making a list of possible protagonists, antagonists and anchors. We figured the main folks were going to be the Village Headman, the Citadel Representative and the Ark Representative. From there, we started adding more and more until we had a list of about 9 or 10 (as above). Misbegotten wasn't on the list at the time (that was something I pulled out of my butt at the last minute to give the PCs a reason to explore the rumors of the Dragon Cult: It was actually a creation of the Dragon Cultist, in order to back up the lie of one of the evil PCs). The players really started to fall into place, choosing roles that interested them or that they thought had potential. Andrew lit up at the thought of the Hero, Joshua as the conniving Citadel House Negotiator, and Lindsey as the Daughter of the Headman. Mark fell into line by picking up the Citadel's Right-Hand Man and Dragon Cultist Infiltrator, deciding early on that he wanted to be a schemer with a possible redeemable story: Someone who got in over their head and wants out without more people dying, including himself.  Seth had a hard time choosing, but authored his own dude. He said, "Hmmm. I was thinking I want to be a Blessed", to which I replied "Awesome!  That's another thing that shakes up the balance of the relationships at the beginning of the game: A powerful Blessed traveller walks into town".  Seth played a Psychic Vin Diesel.<br/><br/>In the end, we had villagers (2 players), Citadel (2 players), Outsider (1 player), and no Ark members (but I took on those roles, including the motherly Monitor Seventeen).<br/><br/>I have to confess, that a lot of the major moving and shaking events of the session, I literally just ad-libbed into creation, and then watched the players pick up those events and move with them.  It worked well, though.<br/><br/>I too was frustrated with the rules a little: I thought I had a solid grasp of them, but had to go back a few times and skip around to find out what I was missing: Because of lack of play examples, I GOT the part about how your "evil" traits can swap out the enemies' score for a better chance to succeed, but I MISSED the part (until the second half of the game) about how your "good" traits can swap out your own ability to give the opponent a harder time to succeed. But after stumbing through a few minor conflicts, we had the game down. There are a few questions, though, which I'll have to ask later*.<br/><br/>My favorite moment too was probably Lindsey and Joshua's conversation above, same as Andrew. No one was turtling, everyone was giving it their all. Joshua, being much more skilled with adlibbing, improv, and having a much better grasp of his badass political character (his inspiration: House Speaker from Dune. Bad-Ass), could have just rolled over Lindsey's character. Lindsey also had a grasp of her character, and was coming up with great retorts to Joshua's character's threats and the like. In a normal game or a game where "the players talk in character and the GM decides who wins", then Joshua would have kept winning hands down.  In this game, though, like most games with social rules, you roleplay, then roll the dice if everyone thinks that it's better to see what happens that way. In a 2-Success conflict, Lindsey ended up winning.  She said a few scathing words to Joshua's conniver, and Joshua totally rolled with it, having his character treat hers in a new light with newfound respect. As Andrew said, that's one of the reasons I really like these kinds of games, when everyone is on board.  This moment made the final "2 heroes vs mile-long mist dragon" fight scene pale in comparison.<br/><br/>I ended up rolling with a pictograph resolution instead of the clock resolution: Unicorn, Blessed, Ark, Misbegotten, Dragon, Devil's Hour.  I was kind of thinking that if I run it at GenCon, I'm probably going to use QUEEN BISHOP ROOK KNIGHT PAWN DRAGON setup to get people into the game without hangup on the terms.<br/><br/>All in all, I was satisfied with the game. I want to run or play in a LoA game set in the Ark next time, perhaps 2-4 sessions.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84022/#Comment_84022" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-30T08:17:29+00:00" title="July 30, 2007  8:17AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 30, 2007 8:17AM by Andy.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, re the problem with the rules:<br/><br/>* Before I forget, here's one:<br/><br/>There's a "2 success" conflict.<br/><br/>Round one: Player one and Player two roll successes.

Extensive play examples would definitely be helpful, for example.  And, just in general, I'm finding that I'm better at rules-writing than I was five years ago, when I wrote most of the <i>Legends of Alyria</i> manuscript.<br><br/>That being said, here goes.<br/><br/>First, it sounds like Setup went really well.  A "psychic Vin Diesel".... Sounds great!<br/><br/>One of my favorite memories from an Alyria session is also a weak character successfully confronting a strong one in verbal conflict.  In our case, it was the first mate of a mist ship who was finally putting his foot down and refusing to be intimidated by a soldier of the Five Hundred.  That kind of stuff is way cool.<br/><br/>Now to the rules inquiries...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>I ended up rolling with a pictograph resolution instead of the clock resolution: Unicorn, Blessed, Ark, Misbegotten, Dragon, Devil's Hour.

The reason is that they are both inherently visual.<br/><br/>Take a look at these pictures:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2776/980/1600/noon.jpg"/><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2776/980/1600/threeoclock.jpg"/><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2776/980/1600/midnight.jpg"/><br/><br/>The first is Sext, the second is Terce, and the last is Matins.  But that's not the point.  <i>Look at the shading</i>.  Which one wins?  Well, which one has more "light" in it?  It's easy to see.  Other forms of iconography lack this simplicity.  That's why it is best to use an actual Clock Die (and not merely rolling on the chart).  (Or a Moon Die, if that's where your fancy lies.)<br/><br/>That being said, it would be awesome if you ran this at GenCon.  I <i>will</i> be demoing it at the Forge booth, in addition to <i>Dirty Secrets</i>, so feel free to send folks my way, too.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>* Before I forget, here's one:<br/><br/>There's a "2 success" conflict.<br/><br/>Round one: Player one and Player two roll successes. No one gets a "10". But they both succeed.  That's one success for each side: 1 to 1.<br/><br/>Round two: Player one and Player two roll successes again. No one gets a "10", but again they both succeed.  Player one rolls a 9, player two rolls a 5. They both get successes. 2 to 2.<br/><br/>However, at this point they both have won, with two successes each?<br/>Or did the person who rolled that "9" "Really win"?<br/>Or did they "tie"?</blockquote>\nBUZZ!  Incorrect.  Thank you for playing.  ;-)<br/><br/>You're not racking up successes.  Rather, you're winning (or not winning) a given exchange.  Here's the rules in question:\n<blockquote>Assuming that no one spends I/C to resolve the conflict, both sides now roll a Clock Die. The die roll is a success if it is greater than or equal to the target clock face. If one side succeeds but the other side does not, then the successful side wins the die roll. If both sides succeed, then the side with the higher temporary Attribute wins the die roll. Failure by both sides leads to an inconclusive result.</blockquote>\nI'll cop to this being not totally clear.  However, the point is this:  only one player wins a given exchange.<br/><br/>So, in your example, Round One should have been won by whichever character had the higher adjusted Attribute.  So, if my character's Attribute after Trait activation is Terce (aka Gibbous aka 8-9), and yours is Prime (aka Half-Moon aka 5-7), again, after Trait activation, then I would win.  Since neither of us rolled Sext (aka Full Moon aka 10), the results after Round One stand at 1-0.  Since I don't know what the different characters' adjusted Attributes are, I can't actually work out for you who should have won.<br/><br/>This means that for a Medium tension conflict (2 exchanges to win) is really a "best out of three" contest, and a High tension conflict (3 exchanges to win) is really a "best out of five" contest.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite><br/>Huh, so does this mean that I can not only sub my own good traits for my roll, and my bad traits for my opponent's roll... But I can also sub THEIR good trait for their roll, and THEIR evil trait for my roll?</blockquote>\nCorrect.  Any Trait of two conflicting Characters is open for use by either player.  The Traits actually used should be remembered when assigning Inspiration and Corruption post-conflict.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84148/#Comment_84148" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-30T14:28:22+00:00" title="July 30, 2007  2:28PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oops, did a stupid thing and ate my own post.<br/><br/>Followup question:<br/><br/>We're running a 2-success conflict.

That's why I go back to either figments from LoA (as above) if not something else (chessmen), because it's easier to attribute a figure like that to a good/evil level.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>*I'm also the only network engineer who can shake down a packet trace back and forth, but forgets the mnemonics for the OSI Model.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84373/#Comment_84373" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-31T14:12:41+00:00" title="July 31, 2007  2:12PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>SCENARIO ONE:<br/>After traits and all are settled:<br/>I need to roll Misbegotten or higher to claim that success.<br/>You have to roll Ark or higher to claim that success.<br/>We BOTH roll 8s on our d10s (aka "BLESSED" if we had specialty dice).

Both dice rolls were successful, so we go with whoever had the higher adjusted Attribute.  That would be you.  Therefore, you win one exchange.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>SCENARIO TWO:<br/>After traits and all are settled:<br/>I need to roll Misbegotten or higher to claim that success.<br/>You have to roll Ark or higher to claim that success.<br/>I roll BLESSED (8)<br/>You roll ARK (6?)<br/>Does that mean that I won this exchange?</blockquote>\nSo again, (using your progression), your adjusted Attribute is Ark (aka Prime), and my adjusted Attribute is Misbegotten (aka Lauds).  Both dice rolls were successful, so we go with whoever had the higher adjusted Attribute (<i>not</i> dice roll).  Again, that would be you.  Therefore, you win one exchange.<br/><br/>Now, you can certainly use the actual dice rolls to flavor narration.  So whoever is narrating could give you a bit more of a narrative edge in Scenario Two, but that's mostly color.  For determining success, the actual die roll doesn't matter beyond passing/not passing the target Attribute.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>For the hours, that just doesn't work for me unfortuantely.

Rather, you should just shade a portion of the circle on the character sheet.  That way, when you roll, you have that visual cue tied to the visual cue on the character sheet.  The actual names don't actually have to enter play at all.<br/><br/>Now, that all being said, if chess pieces works for your group, then more power to you.<br/><br/>And I'm a database administrator, and I have no idea what the OSI Model is, let alone the mnemonics.  :-D<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
