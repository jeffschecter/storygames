This session got pretty emo, with some doctor-convict forbidden love mixed in with the usual nice guys finishing last. Also fun - it was a four-player game and nobody chose the Dimber Damber, so his proxy/enforcer called all the shots and we were never sure the King of Crime actually existed. There were also several ... unusual ... solutions suggested for the escalating starvation problem.<br/><br/>Favorite moment: Sheppett, the Dimber Damber's Captain Sharp (I will never tolerate an insult) gets humiliated by the Captain of Marines, and forces Jacks, a Ticket-of-Leave man (I will never be in chains again) to avenge him with some violence. Sheppett keeps his vow and poor Jacks breaks his in the saddest possible way. Sorry about that, Shane!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336775/#Comment_336775" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-02T06:23:49+00:00" title="August  2, 2011  6:23AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Played my Fantasy game Charge! last night, starting up a fresh campaign.<br/><br/>Our set-up is a vast steampunk city with the PCs living in the Gutter while the middle up and upper class live in Spires connected via bridge and walkways.  <br/><br/>We have a tinkerer named Arlo who has a murder of a Necromancer Crime Lord's daughter pinned on him, his time mage brother Isaac, and Arlo's close friend Yulia - a prostitute who trades in information and goods and is well known in the Gutter.<br/><br/>First scene is the Necromancer Crime Lord's thugs roughing up Arlo on his workshop/boat and Isaac gets attacked by a Ghoul and weasely Human.  The result is Isaac laying on the deck of his boat bleeding out from an open gunshot wound.  His brother Isaac shows up early morning to find him half-dead and quickly crafts some chronomancy to speed up the healing of his wounds, saving him in the nick of time.<br/><br/>So later they're trying to chase down the actual killer of the Crime Lord's daughter to cleare Arlo's name they discover that Isaac, the time mage, murdered the Crime Lord's daughter.  Once they realized what happened the look on their faces was brilliant.  <br/><br/>So now, for some reason, in the future Isaac travels back in time to kill the Crime Lord Uriah Waley's daughter (we're not sure why at this point), but in the present Waley believes Arlo either was the main perp or had something to do with it.  <br/><br/>Luckily there are plenty of other clans and families to play against the Waleys.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337551/#Comment_337551" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-07T17:46:49+00:00" title="August  7, 2011  5:46PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Made sand castles with my little brother at the beach today.<br/><br/>It's easy to forget how awesome unstructured play is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337564/#Comment_337564" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-07T21:14:28+00:00" title="August  7, 2011  9:14PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But did you win?!?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337571/#Comment_337571" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-07T23:52:24+00:00" title="August  7, 2011 11:52PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 8, 2011 1:09PM by Steve_Hickey.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I playtested <a href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/left-coast" rel="nofollow">Left Coast</a> with Mike Sands on Saturday. It was the first time I've run the new version of the game, and I'm happy with the results. Within about 30 minutes, we'd created our two science fiction authors (J. Oberon Eldritch and Robert M. Curtis) and surrounded them with a cast of characters that very naturally led  into two very different types of story: <br/><br/>- Oberon was caught in the middle of kitchen-sink realism meets LSD-induced enlightenment. He was simultaneously a bum crashing at his brother's house, while leading a group of occultists and university professors in the consumption of drugs. Oberon was trying to open his mind up to a higher plane of reality and (hopefully) understand what the Psychic Voice in his head was telling him. <br/><br/>The highlight of that story for me, though, was Oberon arguing with his straight-arrow banker brother, trying to scam $5 off him to afford postage to send off his manuscript. The amount of venom and resentment that came out of that simple conversation was pretty amazing.<br/><br/>- Bob Curtis becoming enmeshed in a paranoid noir where his parole officer was blackmailing him for money and Bob's doppleganger seemed to be planning a crime to frame Bob and put him put back behind bars.<br/><br/>Lots of stuff to tweak, but I think the game's basic structure is sound, I ended being really curious about what was going on with all the other NPCs in both stories, and  Mike's keen to play again so that's a win in my book.

He finally decides he's going to have to take matters into his own hands and decides to start forging weapons for the Tar'Chaka Tribe (An Orc lead crime family at war with the Lynch Clan) and begins to formulate a plan to take down Uriah Lynch.  <br/><br/>Shit hits the fan as his time to find the actual murderer of Uriah Lynch's daughter is running out.  He sends another Ghoul and Thug to rough up Arlo and tell him he has 1 day left till they're putting a bullet in his head so he better dredge up the murderer.  We know Arlo's brother Isaac is the murderer and he's not going to give him up so Arlo decides to send a message.  He pushes the ghoul into his forge causing it to erupt in flames and stares down the Thug.<br/><br/>Later Arlo would rig his workshop with explosives, causing the detonate the following night and taking out even more of the Lynch Clan's muscle.  Now he's orchestrating a massive offensive with a brutal Orc Mob Boss featuring a ground blackpowder offensive and an artillery barrage from the rooftops of the nearby district.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338250/#Comment_338250" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-11T10:32:35+00:00" title="August 11, 2011 10:32AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jadeclaw.<br/><br/>The previous week ended with the guard captain and some thugs knocking out two of the party, and forcing a third (a noble) to surrender (as the fourth ran off).<br/><br/>The players learn that they are trespassing, and that the governor has a plot to seal everyone in a mine and collapse it, to cover up his recent activities.  Naturally, the peasants don't want to die either, and encourage the bloodied and bruised player characters to break them free and defeat the governor and guard captain (and did we mention 15 guardsman while you're at it?)<br/><br/>The magician steps up, using his spells hella creatively (part of the reason I love this system.)  Levitates the keys off the guards, uses the smoke from the mining equipment to choke and distract the guards...<br/><br/>Being horribly outnumbered, they got clever.  They capitalized on rumors of a curse and had the peasants start chanting while the magician curled the ashes and soot into a mighty Dragon!  Most of the guards fled in terror.  But the governor was not impressed, and his niece (the guard captain) wanted the player characters dead.<br/><br/>So the noblest of them (who also has the Overconfident flaw) challenges her to a duel.  In his best John McClain impersonation, he stays on his feet for two exchanges of blades (in that system once you're wounded to a certain degree, you have to roll each round or pass out), finally scoring first blood (the terms of the duel), but then she keeps fighting!<br/><br/>I asked him simply, "Do you counterattack and kill her, or go full-defense and trust the governor to stop his niece?"<br/><br/>He looks at everyone else, knowing he's got their lives in his hands, and takes the high road.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338402/#Comment_338402" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-12T09:18:22+00:00" title="August 12, 2011  9:18AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We played ANIMAL CRIMES.<br/><br/>My femme fatale, Kitty McCorgi (ne\xe9 Kat), died in Marmot Detective's arms after their one night of passion, shot by her jealous former lover, Sgt.

This allows me to pick it up and run with it for 10-15 minutes, stop, gets some errands done, and then continue where I paused it.

It rocks. Lots of bite-sized goodness, too. I'll start with the latest:<br/><br/>I'm running LB for my old D&amp;D buddy Cranston, his girlfriend Natalie and her housemate Andrew--both brand new roleplayers, and Shakespeare-in-the-park players. They're playing Capt. Vance, Lady B and Kale, respectively. The Lady and Captain waste no time telling each other how fucking annoying and useless each other are, while Kale turns out to be a hyperactive, child-like idiot savant, constantly told to shut up but never taking it personally.<br/><br/>Kale takes a shine to Naomi Bishop (an NPC), and Andrew quickly invents "The Key of Buff Naomi." he follows her around, taking XP every time he gets off on goading her into using her strength--on enemies, on objects, on him, whatever.<br/><br/>After the usual-bickering-filled escape, the Lady comes clean about her identity, and then...Sky Squid attack! Kale fires up the "Electron Alternating-Field Rig" (I'm probably getting that name wrong) to shock the squid into releasing the ship. The pair of squid chase the owl, keening their haunting song, and the Lady feels through their Stormblood that they're singing to her! She demands that she be hooked into the electron rig, and with wires jammed into wrist incisions, she creates a massive magic field around the ship, which, rather than repelling the squid...calm them. They orbit the field around the Owl, cooing lovingly. And the Lady passes out.<br/><br/>Kale determines that Lady Blackbird is trapped in a Sky Squid dream, and hooks the Captain in to call her out of it. Cranston rolls...and fails! So he successfully makes contact, but gets sucked in himself! So he meets the Lady where her dream-form flies with the Squid in harmony and bliss. Their former lives are a hazy blur.<br/><br/>Cranston buys off the Key of Hidden Longing! "I...I think I love you."<br/><br/>Natasha stares. "Wh...who are you again?"<br/><br/>Kale yanks the Captain back, and Natasha, in a moment of clarity, sends the Sky Squid away (she takes the Secret of Sky Song, of course) and returns herself.<br/><br/>They remember EVERYTHING.<br/><br/>We're playing again next week.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hoog" title="hoog"><img alt="hoog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hoog">hoog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338731/#Comment_338731" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-14T13:33:09+00:00" title="August 14, 2011  1:33PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Back after a long time away!)<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayed Contenders, Zombie Cinema, Fiasco, Monts\xe9gur, Roach and DRYH last week with a bunch of noob friends.

It is a fun system and, in addition to ninjas, a great twist on some of what I consider trad techniques (lots of player secrets, long skill lists), some new age developments (rotating scene structure a la Fiasco, shared GM duties/incomplete character ownership), and a fun point system to determine a winner! So fun that even Nope, Japan might play it.<br/><br/>I, without looking at my chargen options, decided on playing a playboy character and was delighted to find that I had Apparel-jutsu as an in-clan option. I rolled for my general goal, and was told by the system to pursue Peace, which I would never have come up with on my own. Then, in the Zero round narration, the GM let me know I was kept in a frozen chamber when I wasn't in use. Crazy cool.
