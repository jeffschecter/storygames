I am curious as to what that means.<br/><br/>Have you ever written a review of an RPG and included this term in the review? If so, can you explain to me what you meant by it. Can you provide a counter example of an RPG "for everyone"?<br/><br/>Have you ever simply described an RPG as "not for everyone" -- whether that's good or bad doesn't matter. Can you expand on what you meant by that? What are your goto "for everyone" games?<br/><br/>Is "for everyone" the default for RPGs and thus only a handful of games need to be labeled with the warning "not for everyone"?<br/><br/>Thread request: If you don't use the term, save your speculation until after I get a few responses.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TheWhaleShark" title="TheWhaleShark"><img alt="TheWhaleShark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TheWhaleShark">TheWhaleShark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306718/#Comment_306718" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-03T21:42:48+00:00" title="January  3, 2011  9:42PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            While I often attach varied meanings to the phrase "not for everyone," I can say that I often use it to mean "you won't get it" when talking to a group of people who, well, won't get it.<br/><br/>But then, I'm a condescending ass.<br/><br/>My "nice" use of the phrase is almost exactly the same as the way I use the phrase "acquired taste" when referring to beer, food, or metal; I use it as a shorthand way of saying "This is very different than what you're used to, and you may not like it as a result of that. You may also just not like what this thing does, period. But I think it's cool, so I think you should try it." <br/><br/>It's like the challenge on the label of Arrogant Bastard, basically. At least, that's how I wield the phrase. The game in question can seem off-putting, and you may have to <b>want</b> to like it.<br/><br/>What I definitely do <b>not</b> do is use "not for everyone" when I mean "this is crap." If I think it's crap, I'll say it, and won't recommend it.<br/><br/>As for the notion of an RPG that is "for everyone," I really don't think any RPG is "for everyone." Once upon a time, I think RPG's really attempted to do that, but in recent years, there's been a growing movement towards using specific games to guide specific kinds of play. D&amp;D does this game, InSpectres does this game, Danger Patrol does the best damn game ever, and so forth. So I see the "not for everyone" as an artifact of phrasing, from an era in its twilight.<br/><br/>However, I think the "for everyone" descriptor could be used to describe those games which are the most <i>accessible</i> and have the lowest required investment. Almost anyone can pick up a game like Danger Patrol and have a ball - even people who don't really play RPG's all that often. The game is quick and punchy, and because the basic kind of story is both simple and widely understood, almost anyone who was ever consumed entertainment-oriented media can do it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306720">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306720/#Comment_306720" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-03T22:06:55+00:00" title="January  3, 2011 10:06PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 3, 2011 10:08PM by Paul_T.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm.<br/><br/>I could see myself using that term ("not for everyone") to describe a game that deals with particularly difficult and/or offensive material.<br/><br/>Otherwise, it confuses me a fair bit, but I'm guessing that's where you're hoping to go a little further along...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EarthenForge" title="EarthenForge"><img alt="EarthenForge" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EarthenForge">EarthenForge</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306722/#Comment_306722" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-03T22:20:23+00:00" title="January  3, 2011 10:20PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, this is a really good phrase to examine.<br/><br/>I don't recall using it in a written review, but I've dropped it in speech a couple of times. I guess it works as a disclaimer (if a fairly useless one), but when I've used it it's more as a gauge on enthusiasm. For example, I'm describing a game I love to friend and I'm pretty sure he'll like it, but I don't want to appear a zealot and turn him off to the game before he even plays it (some people are really sensitive and suspicious about zealotry of any kind), so I blurt out that phrase that oh so subtlety suggests, "look! I'm not an extremist! I respect that other people have valid opinions that don't agree with mine!" And hopefully it will be enough to erase his own small concern about trying it and not liking it and then having to face me. I also slightly invalidate the phrase by following it with "but," as in, "it's not for everyone, but I think <i>you</i> will really enjoy it."<br/><br/>-Rachel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306725/#Comment_306725" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-03T22:46:48+00:00" title="January  3, 2011 10:46PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't use the phrase often.

I probably also use the phrase as a weaselly caveat when I dislike a game (or someone I know does) and I want to acknowledge that opinion without making it the central topic of conversation. I wouldn't ever use the phrase "for everyone" -- I can't guarantee that people will like something, but some people have well-defined categories that they despise so it's easy to predict that certain things won't work for them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306726/#Comment_306726" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-03T22:46:58+00:00" title="January  3, 2011 10:46PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 3, 2011 10:47PM by JDCorley.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I used to say it a lot before I realized that aesthetic preferences are so specific in people, and so varied among people, that it really doesn't need to be said at all. Now I only really say it when a game hits an extremely narrow band of preference, or a preference that is not widely supported anymore. For example, Alpha Omega's combat system is extremely detailed and finicky to a degree not widely supported anymore, (though at one point it was fairly common, as I recall.)  So when I say "it's not for everyone", I  really mean "not a lot of games do this right now". The highly detailed social conflict system in Burning Empires is another example.

Breaking it down a bit more, I think that it really comes down to 'I expect that certain people will <b>actively dislike</b> this product'.<br/><br/>So Britney Spears (for example) isn't something I'd apply the "not for everyone" disclaimer to. That doesn't mean that I think that "everyone" <i>will</i> like her music, it's just that there's nothing challenging or offensive about it, so people will mostly settle on like or not-like on it. However, something like Throbbing Gristle is rather more difficult listening, and many people will actively dislike or be offended by it. It's "not for everyone".<br/><br/>In RPGs I'd usually expect to see the term used for difficult/challenging settings. Seeing it applied to mechanics is initially surprising to me, although on reflection looking at how certain mechanics have fallen out of favour over the years (e.g. table look ups) I suppose there's something to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306758/#Comment_306758" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-04T06:43:17+00:00" title="January  4, 2011  6:43AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 4, 2011 6:46AM by merb101.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have used variations of the phrase in my game reviews. What I often mean is the premise or setting of the game, usually something so tied in with the game that to remove it makes it not that game, can make people not want to play.<br/><br/>A more broad example: When I wrote a review of Godlike I mentioned the characters felt real and vulnerable because the rules made them feel like that (a credit to the game). But coupled with it being set in World War II, which I knew people who had actually served in WWII including my grandfather, the setting felt too real for me and was a bit disturbing. I basically said that those who don't like the war genre or who have connections to those who've fought in war might find the game disturbing. <br/><br/>In my opinion, the game isnt for everyone. Take something like D&amp;D or Faerie Tale or DC Heroes that is divested enough from reality to be "safe" and can be scaled in terms of violence and subject matter without losing the game, and I feel it is a game for everyone. Doesn't mean everyone is going to like it, but I feel it is accessible.<br/><br/>I would describe games like Maid (which I love), the Shab Al-Hiri Roach (which I really like) and Steal Away Jordan (which I will never play but admire) as "not for everyone." The Maid and SAJ for the subject matter, the Roach more because it is a tricky game and requires (in my opinion) a bit of skill to play. <br/><br/>I will try and expand on this if people want.<br/><br/>Edit: Hit post, then thought of this. When I say "not for everyone" in a review, I am meaning a person could have a negative reaction toward the game and roleplaying. Not a "i don't like this," but a more viceral "that is sick" or "why the hell would anyone find this fun?" kinda reaction. And since I write reviews with an eye toward non-gamers, I want to avoid that feeling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306767/#Comment_306767" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-04T07:37:03+00:00" title="January  4, 2011  7:37AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure, I've used it. I don't think I've ever used it in a written review though.<br/><br/>I think, actually, use could accurately say "not for everyone" of <i>every game ever published.</i> But back in days of yore when everyone was working from the same play assumptions, "not for everyone" probably referred more to roleplaying in general. <br/><br/>Whenever I've said a game is "not for everyone" to somebody, I'm referring to some particular aspect of play that I believe will be not-fun for a segment of players. Whenever I've said "BW is not for everyone," this is usually how I start talking about how failure works in the game. Not every RPer is gonna be on-board with the failing-forward thing -- the players identify so closely with their characters that they have no authorial perspective on the play process, so failing *on purpose* just seems crazy. Like failing on purpose in real life. Or the Artha cycle in general, because not all players are incentivized by the same things.<br/><br/>I guess that last part is the crux of it: not all players are incentivized by the same things. <br/><br/>Oldskool D&amp;D isn't for me because I so don't give a shit about what gets rolled up on a treasure table when I murder something.<br/><br/>Apocalypse World isn't for my friend David because he can't get on board with the idea that "do harm (as established)" is a move the MC can just do.

This is true of all entertainment. While it is trivially true that "no game is for everyone", in this specific context the phrase does have a use.<br/><br/>There are games people want to play that they know a large proportion of other people won't enjoy because they have content much more liable to offend than most games. I give you The Book of Unremitting Horror. It's not for everyone. That doesn't mean I'm unsure how I feel about it, or I find it offensive. I am sure how I feel about it, do not find it offensive, and enjoy playing it. It really does mean I think (and know from the evidence) that many people do find it offensive.  I don't want them to buy it. Sometime people mean what they say. Add that to your list.<br/><br/>That's not to say that reviewers (and in particular playtesters) sometimes use the reactions of their perceived audience to project their own feelings. We specifically ask playtesters not to worry about what any category of person outside their game group thinks of a game. This was to stop people saying "I think novices would find this difficult" and "some people might find this offensive." I don't want to know if they think it's not for everybody; I want to know if it's for them.<br/><br/>Finally, you say "ill-considered ominous statements can certainly turn someone away from trying a game." That may be true, but saying that the BOUH or Graham's Purist adventures are not for everybody, then describing what the games are about stop people playing and buying games they aren't going to like. It's managing expectations. In most cases it ends up selling more copies rather than reducing sales. People like not to be part of everybody when it comes to culture.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306785/#Comment_306785" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-04T08:55:39+00:00" title="January  4, 2011  8:55AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Luke Wheel</cite>"Well who is the game for?" . . .

I'm even thinking it's kind of a mine field to get into negative specifics -- "this game is not for players who are into X type play". At least in my own head, I've got too many shorthand assumptions going to really get my point across that way. <br/><br/>I'm gonna think through it with an example I know well.<br/><br/>Like, if I explained that "BW is not for players who don't like the idea of failing on purpose," I'm not even sure that that's the point. In my own head, when I say "some players aren't on board with the idea of failing forward," I'm also referring to a general succeed-at-all-costs sort of immersive player who advocates only on behalf of his character's interests, and probably cares only about getting wealthier and more powerful. Hell, they're probably pretty immature players. Let's just call them basement-dwelling catpiss fatbeards and be done with it. Yeah, that's a mine field. :-)<br/><br/>The opposite -- "BW is for players who like the idea of failing on purpose" -- isn't the point either. I don't think any player likes it when their character fails. But a certain kind of player will appreciate that receiving mechanical inducements in return for occasional fictional complications (and then later using those mechanical inducements to wrangle temporary authority by avoiding unwanted complications) results in a more dramatic, literary-style storyline in the game. <br/><br/>That's a mouthful! "This game isn't for everyone" is so simple! :-)<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://media.avclub.com/images/products/productgroup/36/M-Stereotypes_400x400_3_jpg_400x400_upscale_q85.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306789/#Comment_306789" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-04T09:26:58+00:00" title="January  4, 2011  9:26AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Luke Wheel</cite>When I read the phrase online, my first reaction is, "Well who is the game for?"

I think your response falls in these two categories:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Luke Wheel</cite><br/>Some people use it as code for, "[specific person] doesn't like stuff like this."<br/>Some people use it as a content warning, "I find these materials offensive."<br/></blockquote>\nYou're worrying about someone's reaction to the game, so you diminish it.

Add that to your list.<br/></blockquote>\nSimon, it seems to me that while you're comfortable with an outre choice of games, you're guessing at the reaction of other people. Why are you trying to mitigate their response? Are you trying to protect yourself? Why not let them decide? I think your response falls in these two categories:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Luke Wheel</cite><br/>Some people use it as code for, "[specific person] doesn't like stuff like this."<br/>Some people use it as a content warning, "I find these materials offensive."<br/></blockquote>\nYou're worrying about someone's reaction to the game, so you diminish it. And I think you do find the material offensive, but that you also find it titillating.<br/><br/><br/>No, I'm analysing data received in playtest reports, and reactions from reviewers, not guessing anything. <br/><br/>Another example. In Ashen Stars we had a space ship combat system, which about 40% of playtesters actively hated and 20% really, really enjoyed. It's not for everyone. We've since rewritten it to fit the background and system better. Another example. I know that my family enjoy Apples to Apples, Articulate and Taboo. I know that only one of them would enjoy Star Fleet Battles. It's not for everyone.<br/><br/>And your second remark is what you are falsely accusing me of - guessing what my reaction is. You don't stick an adult warning on a game because you find it offensive, but because it's not for everyone; in the case of the BOUH, "not for everyone" includes children. Some people may well use it as code. I use it factually, as do many others. Think of it as a publisher content warning. I don't want people buying my games who aren't going to enjoy them.

I don't really see the problem with the label. I just read "Not for everyone" as shorthand for "in my opinion, this is a niche game with a narrow scope; see that it caters to your tastes before taking the plunge", which isn't bad advice in itself. Some game systems have the pretense to do mostly everything (WoD?) some don't. Two games I own and play I could see myself describing as such: Wraith (amusingly enough in light of what I just said I guess) and Yuyake Koyake. I don't know you, but I wouldn't pull a game of Wraith at an initiation table. When done well, it's a very heavy game and, in my experience at least, very few people want that level of involvement. At least not too often. As for Yuyake Koyake... well most people <i>can't</i> play that game straight, I swear. None I know at least*. I was barely in the plane back from Japan play-testing it with my friends and we had already changed it into a sadistic game of  Black humor in which the dog kills children, can't lie about it, but gets forgiven automatically before comforting the parents using his powers...<br/><br/>Now the problem is all about knowing what is considered "broad" and "narrow" I guess, which is highly context sensitive.  I mean, Alva Noto's music being described as "not for everyone" in a pop music column doesn't trouble me the least.. I'd be mad if it was described the same in electronic music fanzine.<br/><br/><br/>*I'm lying actually now that I think of it. And it <i>was</i> a magic experience too. Try picturing a bunch of thuggish/threatening looking guys on parole role-playing a bunch of fairy-kids playing soccers and trying to fit in. Brings a smile to my face just  typing it.

If "everyone" has the same or similar meaning pop into their head...then that's what the word means...because words have no intrinsic meaning outside of what people understand when they hear it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a handful of people hear it one way, while most everyone else hears it another...then that handful can be corrected for getting it wrong.  But when 80% of the people believe a word or phrase means a thing...then that word or phrase means that thing.  Regardless of what the word or phrase USED to mean.  Regardless of what a small slice of the population who continue to adhere to its older definition want it to mean...the language has moved on...slang becomes the new norm...live with it.  In fact, one could argue that when the adherents to the old definition continue to use the word the old way, and they represent but a handful...then they are now the ones using it wrong and need to be corrected.  Languages change.<br/>\n<br/>\nSee also "Ironic".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307076/#Comment_307076" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-06T07:12:51+00:00" title="January  6, 2011  7:12AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            'It's not for everyone' is a useful phrase.<br><br>It offers cues-- not about the game-- but about the mindset of the reviewer.<br><br>So I know whether to believe their opinions.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307078">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307078/#Comment_307078" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-06T07:22:41+00:00" title="January  6, 2011  7:22AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>Alternatively, when almost everyone who uses that phrase uses it to mean something other than its original use...that means the language has moved on.</blockquote>\nNo matter how many people say it, it is still wrong. "beg the question" is such an illuminating, wonderful phrase to start with. To degrade it to "raise the question" is unacceptable.

Words have no meaning outside of useage.  Meaning is defined by useage.  Dictionaries and glossaries don't supply meaning, they merely catalog what was common useage at the time they were written.  You've got the cart before the horse.  "Ooga Booga" could mean "damn that's hot" if everyone started using that way...or it could remain a meaningless collection of sounds if no consistent useage develops.

Words have no meaning outside of useage.  Meaning is defined by useage.</blockquote>"Evolution isn't a fact, it's a theory!"<br/><br/>This is entirely the problem with language drift and the re-purposing of words. When you come up with a new word or phrase to describe something for which we already had a word or phrase, that's fine. That's linguistic evolution.<br/><br/>The problem with co-opting extant words and phrases is that it directly causes inconsistencies and ambiguities in communication. This is especially problematic now that we have vast amounts of permanently archived communications.<br/><br/>Here's an example. In medieval Europe, the "bushel" referred to several different sizes of measurement depending on your location. In fact, the size of a "bushel" varied across a single country. Yet, the term "bushel" was applied to all of those measurements. As a modern audience, this makes it impossible to actually figure out what the hell was going on back then. The drift in the meaning of that particular word results in an inability to correctly interpret written records. So, when I try to concoct a beer from the 1300's, I have no idea if they're talking about a Winchester bushel, a Northern London bushel, or a Southern London bushel. Or a bushel from anywhere else in Europe.<br/><br/>That may not seem vital, but the standardization of language is what permits useful, accessible records, particularly in the scientific fields.<br/><br/>So, while it may not always be significant, the "drift" in the meaning of a particular phrase can be a source of great confusion in any communication, and depending on the severity of the miscommunication, this can have some pretty strong consequences. Like, say, entire swathes of people thinking that "theory" means "conjecture" when referring to evolution, even though a scientific theory is actually a logical framework constructed from a strong body of factual information.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307146/#Comment_307146" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-06T14:05:09+00:00" title="January  6, 2011  2:05PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Peter, completely agreed.<br/><br/>My point (which included taking the opportunity to joust with my old nemisis, JD) was that there comes a time when you just have to acknowledge that a word ain't ever again gonna mean what you think it used to mean...and give up on the whole chastising people for using it wrongly thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307147/#Comment_307147" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-06T14:12:32+00:00" title="January  6, 2011  2:12PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What I really love is that "pedantic" seems to have survived untainted for a very long time now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307148/#Comment_307148" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-06T14:18:58+00:00" title="January  6, 2011  2:18PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you ever heard that used outside of geek culture?

Now, I should probably feel ashamed of my elistism, but I sure don't feel ashamed for liking different stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307278/#Comment_307278" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-07T09:48:57+00:00" title="January  7, 2011  9:48AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If the entirety of the review is "This game is not for everyone," then I agree it is a useless phrase.<br/><br/>If there is an explanation why the reviewer believes this, then I think it is very useful and exactly the purpose of the review.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307285/#Comment_307285" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-07T10:09:47+00:00" title="January  7, 2011 10:09AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>As in: I am not recommending this game unconditionally, but if you like this sort of game, it's a good one of its kind.

Saying that the most popular interpretation of a thing is the most valuable interpretation or the most valid interpretation for a person to use completely devalues whole swathes of human culture. If you had to poll the majority of people in the English speaking world, how many people would find any value in something like 'Ode to a Grecian Urn' or think of opera singers when someone says diva or the Blessed Virgin when someone says Madonna... does that mean people who cut their language finer, who get more mileage out of the words they use, should stop getting the value they do from them, or that they should stop trying to get other people to appreciate something that they do about language? To say that anyone's language is wrong is just sloppy and inaccurate. Language, like so many things, just is, and in a lot of ways is out of our control, but to martyr precise usage on the altar of populist appeal is as much of a mistake as claiming that someone else's less differentiated usage is somehow a reflection on them as a person.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307644">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
