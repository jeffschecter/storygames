Has anyone played this game as a campaign or figured out a good system to hack advancements?  I realize the d12/d8/d4 attributes should not change/advance.<br/><br/>  I'm thinking more along the lines of talking at the end of the adventure and saying "Roland you successfully rode across the plains while chased by bandits, take D6 skill in horseriding" or "Zellchius, you attempted to impersonate a Priest of Kimmon; and although they saw through your plan, you may either learn more about disguise or Religion of Kimmon-- take a D6 in your choice?"<br/><br/>  Or is this already built in to the game?  Is it an established fact that since you rode across the plains, you now have some benefit in future tests?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406400/#Comment_406400" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-16T12:27:27+00:00" title="February 16, 2013 12:27PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [Disclaimer: I have not played this game yet, though it's near the top of my owe list.]<br/><br/>I don't think this kind of advancement is already built in \u2014 I don't see any rules for giving bonuses to rolls, or altering the result of a roll at all (aside from reroll tokens.)<br/><br/>I like the idea of earning these kinds of bonuses due to experience. I'm not sure counting them as new ability dice will work right, though, since you'll later end up having to choose between the new ability and an original broader one. In your example, before Roland got the D6 in horse riding, he might have instead used his D6 "herdsman" ability, so there's no mechanical benefit. Or worse, what if he already had a D10 as a herdsman?<br/><br/>Instead, maybe there's a new category of "bonuses" that give you a small edge in particular actions. So Roland's experience might grant him a +1 to his rolls that involve horseback riding. Or the blessing the holy man put on Thag's scimitar might give it a +1 when he hits with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P" title="Stephen P"><img alt="Stephen P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/529/n6YUPMWXC0KWV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P">Stephen P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406404/#Comment_406404" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-16T13:58:12+00:00" title="February 16, 2013  1:58PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is an interesting question. I imagine that Simon didn't originally offer advancement options mainly because there is little character development in the pulp fantasy stories that the game draws from. (And maybe he'll have suggestions: summoning <a href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">@Simon_C</a>!).<br/><br/>I'd be a bit wary about offering +1 bonuses, since--with the roll and keep mechanic-- that ends up being a pretty huge bonus. (That may or may not bother you; it just might reinforce the behavior of falling back on one method for solving every problem: "I hit it with my +1 sword!"). <br/><br/>I think the opportunity to add new abilities would work fairly well. After each session, allow the characters to gain a new d6 ability (and perhaps the option to advance a d6 ability to d10?). You could have these be additional minor and more focused abilities, which are likely to not add too much new mechanical weight to the character, or you could have them be as broad as the original d6 abilities, which would boost the character's expertise pretty drastically.<br/><br/>A third option would be to allow character change without character power improvement (although this might not appeal to you, if you are looking for the DnD style power gain that "leveling" usually indicates). After each session, just allow the characters to switch out one of their abilities (d6/d10) for a new, equally broad ability--preferable one that had to do with their fictional activity this story, or else in the direction that they've been training-- or else allow them to rearrange their attributes (d4/d8/d10) to reflect their character's new focus. This option would probably be the most sustainable in the long run, since the characters are already start much, much stronger than in most fantasy games, but it may not provide the power increase that you're looking for. <br/><br/>Honestly, though, all of these options would work fine. They'll have varying effects on the character's power levels, but this isn't a game where power balance or power level is a primary concern, so I'd experiment. Pick whichever sounds like the most fun to you and your fellow players! None of them will break the game. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406416/#Comment_406416" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-16T15:58:15+00:00" title="February 16, 2013  3:58PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi!<br/><br/>This is an interesting question. Stephen is right that I didn't write rules for advancement because, to my mind, Sword and Sorcery is generally not concerned with its heroes growing in power and competence. Often what does change is the "scope" of the characters' actions. You could check out Rod Edwards' "Trollbabe" for a system which explicitly references this growing scope.<br/><br/>The option Stephen suggests, that players are free to change their characters' abilities between sessions or adventures is also a good idea, and in my opinion, is already completely supported by the rules.<br/><br/>Another way in which characters grow in power is simply through establishing facts in the world. As you suggest, it's already built into the game to some extent. Conflicts are triggered when a character does something dangerous. But if we have established your character has become expert at something, what was once dangerous for them may now be routine. The GM has discretion to decide what constitutes danger, and should make that decision with reference to the character's established abilities.<br/><br/>If you're set on introducing some mechanical recognition of growing character abilities, I suggest introducing them as extra abilities, using all the normal rules for what constitutes an acceptable ability. My own taste would be to make these rare, representing years lived in a new environment, or in dedicated study to a new skill.<br/><br/>I hope this is useful to you. Let me know how it works out in play, and I'll be happy to answer any other questions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406417/#Comment_406417" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-16T16:34:46+00:00" title="February 16, 2013  4:34PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'd be a bit wary about offering +1 bonuses, since--with the roll and keep mechanic-- that ends up being a pretty huge bonus.</blockquote>You're right; I had temporarily forgotten that the dice are maxed, not summed.<br/><br/>An alternative mechanic for the bonus could be to bump the associated ability's die one level, e.g. raising a D6 to a D8.

After each session (or adventure, or whatever) you could add a d8 ability which narrows the scope of a d6 ability. You could even potentially do this up to a d10 (or maybe d12? But that's pretty rarified...) level. Then, if one of the more specialized abilities applies, you could use it in place of the d6 ability.<br/><br/>Ex.: <br/>Herdsman of Othur d6<br/>-- Bareback Riding d8<br/>-- Parthian Shot d10<br/><br/>You could also combine this with the option to take a new d6 skill, and perhaps to add a d12 to the d10 ability... in any case, you could scale it to whatever level of complexity the group found right.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406432/#Comment_406432" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-16T22:57:38+00:00" title="February 16, 2013 10:57PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How about tying "advancement" into in-fiction goals, like getting a group of followers, securing a position, earning a title, earning someone's respect, killing off a rival, building a fortress, accumulating information, that kind of thing?<br/><br/>That sounds more interesting to me given the system and genre than any kind of mechanical incentive.<br/><br/>Some of Apocalypse World's advancement options could be a source of inspiration for this.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ATXrds" title="ATXrds"><img alt="ATXrds" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ATXrds">ATXrds</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406557/#Comment_406557" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-18T20:24:50+00:00" title="February 18, 2013  8:24PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the suggestions all.  I realize it's purely psychological, but with RPGs I've always keyed on improvements/leveling up.  Even though I recognize that it's not necessary for a game like On Mighty Thews where your character doesn't start off as a weakling.  I'm mainly playing w/ my kids and I suspect 5 or 6 adventures would probably be max before they switch to a different game or different characters; thus we shouldn't clutter up the character sheet w/ these "advancements."                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
