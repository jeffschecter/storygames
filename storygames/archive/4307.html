I've <i>never</i> designed a game before and I'm nervous even posting this.  I just discovered this contest today.  I don't even know if I'll finish by Sunday but I'll give it a go.  My game's called <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Keys of Absence</span>.  It uses Sight B, Sound A, and Concept B.<br/><br/>Here's the grab'em blurb:<br/>You\xe2\u20ac\u2122re dead.  But your still here on Earth.  Your memories of your life are empty but for one thing: you remember doing little to \xe2\u20ac\u0153follow that dream\xe2\u20ac\x9d.  Not much more than baby steps.  Rack your brains all you want.  You won\xe2\u20ac\u2122t remember that dream or what kept you from it.  That\xe2\u20ac\u2122s why your still here.  Not enough spirit to break out of this place.  And soon what little\xe2\u20ac\u2122s left of you will just disappear like morning haze.  However, there\xe2\u20ac\u2122s one last hope.  Find a breather who\xe2\u20ac\u2122s like you used be.  Get in his head, find his dream, and set it free.  Maybe you\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll find yourself in there.  Just look out for the keys.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, a ghost of someone who failed to achieve it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s dream gets one last shot at the golden ring before it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s spirit disappears forever.  The ghost enters the psyche/mind of a living person and hunts down that person\xe2\u20ac\u2122s dream.  But something in the living person\xe2\u20ac\u2122s mind doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t want that dream found.  <br/><br/>Three things I've learned so far: 1) I don't know what the hell I'm doing; 2) I'm having some trouble putting my ideas into words;  3) I type really slow.<br/><br/>I'll post more when I have something that makes sense.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>James                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/alejandro" title="alejandro"><img alt="alejandro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/alejandro">alejandro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97046/#Comment_97046" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-17T22:29:48+00:00" title="September 17, 2007 10:29PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            James, that sounds awesome... and oddly familiar...

The image drawn sets the stage for the scene.  Players add sensory images to the scene, excluding audio images.  Once the scene is set, all the players, choose one of their sound cards they feel best complements or contrasts the scene.  The Judge decides (Apples to Apples style) which sound \xe2\u20ac\u02dcwins\xe2\u20ac\u2122.  The winner then inspires or demoralizes the breather.  The game ends when the breather is fully inspired or demoralized, or if the Ghost finds 3 Keys of Absence and fades away.  <br/><br/>Turn structure<br/><br/>The person closest to the room enterance begins play as the Judge.  The player to the Judge\xe2\u20ac\u2122s left is the Ghost this turn and the player to the right of the Judge is the Hold. <br/><br/>The Judge pulls a card from the \xe2\u20ac\u02dchat\xe2\u20ac\u2122 and reads the image written on it but doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t show it to anyone.  The Ghost turns over a card from the deck.  The suit determines if the other players join or oppose the player as well as the tenor of the scene.  <br/><br/>Suit<br/>Hearts (Dreams): all players join Ghost; the scene is part of the Ghost\xe2\u20ac\u2122s deferred dream<br/>Spades (Nightmares): all players join Hold; the scene is the Hold\xe2\u20ac\u2122s aggression<br/>Club or Diamonds(normal): player\xe2\u20ac\u2122s choose sides; the scene is mundane\xe2\u20ac\u201dthe Ghost inspires and the Hold resists<br/><br/>Beginning with the Ghost each player, except the Judge, adds one sensory element--save audio--to the scene.  Once all the players add their details the Ghost adds one more.  All the players then choose the sound card they hold that they feel best \xe2\u20ac\u02dcpowers\xe2\u20ac\u2122 their side of the struggle.  <br/><br/>The Judge decides which sound prevails in the scene.  The only exception to this is if a player chooses a sound written on the image card.  That sound trumps all others.  The Judge declares the player of the trump sound the winner.  In the unlikely event two player both have a trump sound the Judge chooses from the remaining sounds in play.   The player who holds the winning sound narrates the effect of the sound on the scene.  If the player is part of the Ghost he adds a word derived from the scene to the one of the empty spots in breathers Vision.  Add the words from the end of the sentence to the beginning.<br/><br/>          A Vision of <span style="color: #00CCFF;"><i>adjective</i></span> <span style="color: #CC66FF;">inspirational or transformational noun</span> to <span style="color: #FF0000;">verb</span> (the) <span style="color: #CC66FF;">noun/phrase</span> and <span style="color: #FF0000;">verb</span> the Key of <span style="color: #CC66FF;">noun</span>.<br/><br/>The Ghost may instead choose to remove a Key if he wins any scene when a spade is in play.  If the player is the part of the Hold he changes a verb or adjective to the opposite, or changes the type of Key.  He may only add a word if there are none for him to change.  <br/><br/><br/>More as it comes . . .                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/okiran" title="okiran"><img alt="okiran" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/okiran">okiran</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98299/#Comment_98299" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-22T11:19:36+00:00" title="September 22, 2007 11:19AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 22, 2007 12:00PM by okiran.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here the whole game as it is now.

That something will do everything it can to keep the breather from changing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/okiran" title="okiran"><img alt="okiran" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/okiran">okiran</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98300/#Comment_98300" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-22T11:20:30+00:00" title="September 22, 2007 11:20AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 25, 2007 6:56AM by okiran.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Basic play structure<br/><br/>Draw an image card from the \xe2\u20ac\u02dchat\xe2\u20ac\u2122.  The image drawn sets the stage for the scene.  Players add sensory images to the scene, excluding audio images.  Once the scene is set, all the players choose one of their sound cards they feel best complements or contrasts the scene.  The Judge decides (Apples to Apples style) which sound \xe2\u20ac\u02dcwins\xe2\u20ac\u2122.  The winner then inspires or demoralizes the breather.  The game ends when the breather is fully inspired (Concept <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> or demoralized, or if the Ghost finds three keys and fades away.  <br/><br/>Turn structure<br/><br/>The person closest to the room entrance begins play as the Judge.  The player to the Judge\xe2\u20ac\u2122s left is the Ghost this turn and the player to the right of the Judge is the Hold. <br/><br/>Before Judging<br/><br/>The Judge pulls a card from the \xe2\u20ac\u02dchat\xe2\u20ac\u2122 and reads the image written on it but doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t show it to anyone.  The Ghost turns over a card from the deck.  The suit determines if the players without roles yet join or oppose the Ghost, as well as the initial tenor of the scene.  <br/>Suit<br/>Hearts (Dreams): all players join Ghost; the<br/>scene is part of the Ghost\xe2\u20ac\u2122s deferred dream<br/>Spades (Nightmares): all players join Hold; the<br/>scene is the Hold\xe2\u20ac\u2122s aggression<br/>Club or Diamonds(normal): player\xe2\u20ac\u2122s choose<br/>sides; the scene is mundane\xe2\u20ac\u201dthe Ghost inspires and the Hold resists<br/><br/>Beginning with the Ghost play moves around the table to the left with each player adding one sensory element, except for audio, to the scene.  The Judge may not add anything to scene.  Once all the players add their details, the Ghost gets a bonus detail to add.  All the players then choose the sound card they hold that they feel best \xe2\u20ac\u02dcpowers\xe2\u20ac\u2122 their side of the struggle and places it face down.  If a club or diamond is in play, players affected by it who haven\xe2\u20ac\u2122t yet chosen a side must do so now<br/><br/>Judging<br/><br/>When the players are ready the Judge tells them to reveal their sounds.  She decides which sound prevails in the scene (similar to Apples to Apples).  The Judge may only consider the situation of the current scene, disregarding any previous results.  However, she chooses the winner as she sees fit.  If a player plays \xe2\u20ac\u02dcthe distant sound of church bells\xe2\u20ac\u2122 as his sound, and it happens to be one the Judge\xe2\u20ac\u2122s favorite sounds, she may choose it simply for that reason.  The Judge need not explain herself.  <br/><br/>The only exception to this is if a player chooses a sound written on the image card.  That sound trumps all others.  The Judge declares the player of the trump sound the winner.  <span style="color: #009900;">A player only gets one trump win per game.</span>  In the unlikely event two players both have a trump sound the Judge is free to choose from the remaining sounds in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/okiran" title="okiran"><img alt="okiran" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/okiran">okiran</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98305/#Comment_98305" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-22T12:00:23+00:00" title="September 22, 2007 12:00PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 25, 2007 6:56AM by okiran.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After Judging<br/><br/>The player who holds the winning sound narrates the effect of the sound on the scene and inspires or corrupts the breathers Vision:   <br/><br/>A Vision of <span style="color: #00CCFF;">adjective</span> <span style="color: #CC66FF;">inspirational or transformational noun</span> to <span style="color: #FF0000;">verb</span> (the) <span style="color: #CC66FF;">noun/phrase</span> and <span style="color: #FF0000;">verb</span> the Key of <span style="color: #CC66FF;">noun</span>.<br/><br/>If the player is part of the Ghost he inspires hope or joy by adding a word derived from the scene to one of the empty spots in breathers Vision, or changing a word corrupted by the Hold.  Add the words from the end of the sentence to the beginning.  Also, the Ghost may instead choose to remove a Key if he wins any scene when a spade is in play. <br/><br/>If the player is the part of the Hold he removes hope by changing a verb, adjective, or the type of Key to another word based on the scene just played.  He may only add a word if there are none for him to corrupt.  <br/><br/><span style="color: #009900;">If the player who won the scene used a trump sound draw a circle around the winning sound</span>. Winning sounds can no longer be used when playing as or joining with the Ghost, and those cards remains face up on the table.  The player gains the benefit of adding one additional sensory element for each face up card.  So, if a player has 2 cards face up he may add three sensory elements.  He may add them all at once or add them as play moves around the table.  Unfortunately, he won\xe2\u20ac\u2122t get the benefit of this on the next turn, as the winner of the scene becomes the next Judge.<br/><br/>Play continues in this way until the players complete a fully realized Vision of Hope or a fully realized Vision of Despair, or three keys are drawn.<br/><br/>End game<br/><br/>Play the sound (A) file, which is The Key of Absence, once players meet one of the conditions mentioned above.  Put all the image cards back in the \xe2\u20ac\u02dchat\xe2\u20ac\u2122 and remove any remaining keys. All players choose an image card from the \xe2\u20ac\u02dchat\xe2\u20ac\u2122.  <br/><br/>If The Key of Absence ends the game: Using the image on the card as a starting point, write the Ghost\xe2\u20ac\u2122s dream\xe2\u20ac\u201dusing things revealed in play\xe2\u20ac\u201das it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s memory returns in the moment the Ghost fades . . .<br/><br/>If the Vision of Despair ends the game: Using the image on the card as a starting point, write how the Hold ultimately defeats the Ghost and expels it from the breather.  <br/><br/>If the Vision of Hope end the game: Using the image on the card as a starting point, write how the breather achieves the vision and how the Ghost, watching the realization unfold, moves on using the spirit it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s gained.  <br/><br/>Take no more than 5 minutes, and use only one index card while writing.  Players take turns sharing what they wrote.<br/><br/><br/>Notes: (Sight B appears in this section)<br/>This is my first attempt at designing a game.  My first time entering a design contest (of any type).  The first time I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve made more than one post in a week to Story Games.  I don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t even know if this is an RPG.  But the rules don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t explicitly say to design an RPG.<br/><br/>I added the subtitle \xe2\u20ac\u02dca Game of Senses and Symbols\xe2\u20ac\u2122 because it sounded cool.  And the game has to do with senses.  And the subconscious uses symbolic imagery.  <br/><br/>I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve left some things intentionally vague.  That\xe2\u20ac\u2122s the story I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m sticking with, anyway.  <br/>I got a little sad writing this because two of the end conditions are downers. : (  <br/>If I win this thing I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll be shocked.  SHOCKED!  If you play this game, let me know what you think.<br/><br/>Thanks to alejandro for coming up with the title.  <br/><br/>You could use these alternate Vision statements:<br/><br/> A Vision of <span style="color: #00CCFF;">adjective</span> <span style="color: #CC66FF;">inspirational or transformational noun</span> to <span style="color: #FF0000;">verb</span> the Key of <span style="color: #CC66FF;">noun</span>.<br/><br/> A Vision of <span style="color: #CC66FF;">inspirational or transformational noun</span> to <span style="color: #FF0000;">verb</span>  the Key of <span style="color: #CC66FF;">noun</span> and <span style="color: #FF0000;">verb</span> (the) <span style="color: #CC66FF;">noun/phrase</span>.<br/><br/>Rereading the ingredients I think all the concepts can apply to this game.<br/>Liminal: the Ghost tries to reach the threshold of \xe2\u20ac\u02dcascension\xe2\u20ac\u2122<br/>Hope: the Ghost tries to make give the breather hope again<br/>Scour: the Ghost searches the breather\xe2\u20ac\u2122s subconscious<br/>Do I get bonus points for that? : )<br/><br/>Back cover blurb (since this is the back cover)<br/>You\xe2\u20ac\u2122re dead.  But your still here on this rock.  Your memories of your life are empty but for one thing: you remember doing little to \xe2\u20ac\u02dcfollow that dream\xe2\u20ac\u2122.  Not much more than baby steps.  Rack your brains all you want.  You won\xe2\u20ac\u2122t remember that dream or what kept you from it.  That\xe2\u20ac\u2122s why your still here.  Not enough spirit to break out of this place.  And soon what little\xe2\u20ac\u2122s left of you will just disappear like morning haze.  There is one thing you can do . . . but it ain\xe2\u20ac\u2122t easy and you only get one shot.  Find a breather who\xe2\u20ac\u2122s like you used be.  Get in his head, find his dream, and set it free.  Maybe you\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll find yourself in there.  Just look out for the keys.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/okiran" title="okiran"><img alt="okiran" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/okiran">okiran</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98904/#Comment_98904" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-25T07:00:01+00:00" title="September 25, 2007  7:00AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Last night I realized I'd nerfed the power of the Judge by making trump sounds too powerful.
