                    [At least for the time being, I'm calling my pilgrimage game <b>Do</b>. <a href="http://gobi.livejournal.com/491884.html" rel="nofollow">I did a small write-up on the double-meaning here.</a>]<br/><br/>I have a bad habit of trying to absorb every cool thing I see, so I'm treading carefully here, but I really like the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1675" rel="nofollow">chain of contrasts</a> character creation. I can see it happening at a table.<br/><br/>Step 1: Everyone writes down a lesson they want to learn.<br/>Step 2: Everyone writes down a lesson they want the person on their left to learn. This lesson <i>resists</i> the lesson chosen by that person.<br/>Step 3: Everyone writes down a lesson they want the person on their right to learn that <i>supports</i> the individual lesson chosen by that person.<br/><br/>Buuuuut... One of my smaller design goals for the game was to have the protagonists discover their abilities through actual play. (This would work something like Mortal Coil where players create the whole magical structure, but on a smaller scale focused on the four elements... maybe. I dunno. Anyway.) Using this method, it feels like players would be "playing before they play." That is, making characters that are <i>too</i> complete for a game that is ostensibly about inexperienced pilgrims learning about the world, about each other and about themselves.<br/><br/>Maybe instead of this being a character creation thing, it's a scene-setting thing. Before reaching a location, everyone goes through those three steps. These declarations establish a few stakes of the events that will occur in this leg of the pilgrims' journey and perhaps the system decides which of those three lessons actually occur. So the system outcomes would be:<br/><br/>a) You learn what you want to learn.<br/>b) You don't learn what you want to learn, but you do learn something else from the person on your right.<br/>c) You learn what you want to learn and learn something else, taught to you by the person on your left. <br/><br/>For something less hard and fast, these outcomes could instead be:<br/><br/>a) You gain [resource] that you can be put towards what you want to learn.<br/>b) You gain [resource] that you can put towards what the person on your right wants you to learn, but not the lesson you chose.<br/>c) You gain [resource] that you can put towards what you want to learn OR what the person on your left wants you to learn. <br/><br/>Those resources would build over the course of several scenes that occur on one leg of the journey.<br/><br/>Is their juice there? I can't tell.                </div>
