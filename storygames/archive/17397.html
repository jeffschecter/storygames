Right?<br/><br/>How does this manifest itself mechanically in the game? How much power do you start with, and how much power is locked away in the advancement system? How much of it is mechanical power (having good stats, having a powerful move, having a large gun) and how much of it is fictional power (holding a high position, knowing a dude, owning an establishment)? How do you approach it when writing hacks?<br/><br/>Also you know, whatever else you can think of discussing. :-)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_393959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393959/#Comment_393959" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-19T13:31:38+00:00" title="October 19, 2012  1:31PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It stays about the same.

The PCs start out with powerful tools to deal with immediate concerns, like not starving, or winning fights, or whatever -- at first, those things are enough to create meaningful complications and interesting trouble. Eventually most PCs get to the point where all that stuff is covered -- at which point they tend to start addressing the underlying problems that made all those basic issues so dire in the first place.<br/><br/>Mechanically, PCs eventually tend to get to the point (some sooner than others) where they roll far fewer misses than in that initial, scrabbling-for-survival stage. This is part of why the scope expansion is important -- now the meaningful complications and interesting trouble are going to come from the structural problems of their circumstances (i.e. Fronts), not from their inability to deal with immediate threats. You can win every fight in the world but that won't necessarily make your Holding any less vulnerable to wasteland raiders; you can seduce the zombie queen, but that doesn't stop the plague. The real problems of Apocalypse World are not problems that can be directly solved at the scope on which the basic moves operate. They can only be solved through the fictional positioning that those moves help govern.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_393964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393964/#Comment_393964" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-19T14:05:13+00:00" title="October 19, 2012  2:05PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Vincent has a good post on the AW forums about how the playbooks balance, in terms of different kinds of effectiveness (mechanical, fictional, mindshare/coolness) Lemme dig it up...<br/><br/><a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=472.msg4307#msg4307" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=472.msg4307#msg4307</a><br/><br/>Start there.

I honestly think that xp and progression is really just there because it's <i>expected</i>- some hacks do away with it, even. Most playbooks have tons of available moves from the get-go, it's just that they only get two of them to start. Those other moves aren't more or less suited to big tasks versus plain survival, so I don't think it's necessarily the additional moves that force the character to take on bigger issues. That's just how games tend to play out in practice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394087/#Comment_394087" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-20T12:14:00+00:00" title="October 20, 2012 12:14PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dunno.

Or AW if you haven't, seeing as it's the game we're sawing on. Not trying to be too much of asshole about it, but like, uh, seriously. <br/><br/>Assuming the disconnect is my terseness, I'll elaborate.<br/><br/>The idea isn't to try and hose the Dogs with lots of big dice or whatever, but rather make them want to give even if you've got shit for dice. I mean, if you have three PCs being all 'three in authority', you can't beat them mechanically, e.g. with dice-probability, ever. But that doesn't matter because the GM isn't trying to beat them with the dice. The GM is reveling the town and pushing the stakes and raising hard, so that the Dog's have to make serious statements about the price of their souls and the blood on their hands. You know, about what's <i>right</i>. <br/><br/>My point isn't that +2 is the same as +3 (no shit) but rather if you're running AW close to the bone, then the fictional positioning is going to be what hoses them (or not). Cause the PCs are pretty potent and the dice are mostly in their favour. That's good because AW is pretty fucking mean, so they're going to need it those 10+'s just to keep the knives outta their guts, or keep them firmly in some others. <br/><br/>Fronts aren't going to be solved by a couple (or any number) of lucky rolls.<br/><br/>I mean, shit, you're not going to unbreak the world cause you can murder and manipulate most anyone no problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394112/#Comment_394112" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-20T18:10:58+00:00" title="October 20, 2012  6:10PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's kinda what I was getting at with my post.

The <i>game world</i> changed an awful lot because of stuff they did, but I'd say the characters themselves only marginally gained power.

When you start you can be pretty good at talking people into things, or killing them, or knowing what they're up to, but only one.

And you might be better at manipulating the maelstrom by having +3 to open your brain and augury (and you can also make NPCs into allies and take control of holdings and gangs and followers, sure), but your ability to really affect the setting still depends primarily on your ability to have a conversation with the MC about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394292/#Comment_394292" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-22T08:09:26+00:00" title="October 22, 2012  8:09AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I agree with Johnstone here.

You can change or even destroy fronts just by picking new features for your hold/gang/cult,  hitting a 12+ on a seduce/manipulate, etc.  The story starts with the simple facts of the PC's lives, evolves into the MC beating them over the head with those facts, then evolves into the players get control of the facts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394313/#Comment_394313" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-22T11:38:31+00:00" title="October 22, 2012 11:38AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't agree with the equation that fewer misses = fewer hard moves. That's an illusion. It looks like a logical conclusion, if you draw all your hard moves from the dice, and you play a game that doesn't stray far from the areas where the characters can increase their mechanical effectiveness.<br/><br/>But you can draw your hard moves from the fiction as well. "Golden opportunity," right? All you need to make a hard move is a setup move. If you set up some kind of disaster in the fiction, and the players don't come up with a solution, in the fiction, you make a hard move. That's an area where mechanical effectiveness might give players more options to deal with a threat <i>on paper</i> (ie on the sheet), but if you introduce a problem that can't be immediately solved by a move, by seducing someone or killing someone, then every character is on the same playing field, and it's up to the players' creativity.<br/><br/>You're right that there's a lot of room for affecting the world through mechanical means by making allies, or using improvements to change things, or turning certain NPCs into your gang or whatever, but there's still an art to translating that mechanical change into fiction.<br/><br/>For example: In one game, the hardholder's people were getting pretty tired of his autocratic style and his constant warmongering, so when he abandoned them to become a Faceless, my Brainer stepped into a leadership position and promised more democracy and to allow the other leaders of the holding an equal say in running things. He even drafted a constitution for them, and we all signed it, I switched playbooks to Hoarder, with a hoard consisting of "plant, anima &amp; human specimens" and "others' castoffs &amp; discards" (since the hardholder had discarded his people), that was conscious and spoke in my mind.

Whether or not this power solves your problems is dependent on other factors, though.<br/><br/>-- Improvements give you more obvious options. Moves are obvious options, and you get more of them. Getting people you command to do things is an obvious option, so the more people you command, the more you can do with them. Whether or not you can do any of the same things without special moves, though, is dependent on the conversation between you and the MC. Like, you can escape without Eye on the Door or Fuck this Shit, right? But you can't just point to a move and say "I'm 'a roll this one, yeah?" Again, whether or not these options solve your problems, or just give you more problems, is dependent on the fiction of the particular campaign.<br/><br/>-- Improvements allow you to make concrete statements about the fiction. Like, "I'm gonna get a gang and pack alpha. Since I just impressed the wasteland cannibals, I think they're going to become my gang now. Cool?" Or you say "this character here is my ally. You have to take your crosshairs off them, MC, and you can't just waste this one unless I fuck up and endanger them." This can have a major impact on the fiction, as much as burning down a holding with your grenade launcher, as much as speaking truth to a mob so they do what you want. How much impact you have, and whether you have the exact impact you want to have, is dependent on the fiction and the conversation you are having with the MC.<br/><br/>So basically, when you get more and more powerful, if your MC just puts mechanically-based problems in front of you (like this is a small gang, 3-harm, 1-armour, fight!) you get better at solving your problems. If the MC puts problems in front of you that are entirely fictional in nature (the water is poisoned, Keeler has the plague), then your improvements don't necessarily make you more powerful, since whatever choice you make will have its own consequences.<br/><br/>You definitely <i>feel</i> more powerful when the lowest stat you ever use is a +2, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/framweard" title="framweard"><img alt="framweard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/framweard">framweard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394373/#Comment_394373" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-22T17:25:37+00:00" title="October 22, 2012  5:25PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 22, 2012 5:26PM by framweard.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, hm.

Once the Gunlugger or Skinner is convinced they can shoot or talk their way out of <i>anything</i>, they invariably will get into a situation where they're in over their head. That's a goldmine, right there.\n<blockquote>But also that advancements come in different flavors. <i>Augury</i> is of a different breed than <i>increase the stat of your choice by +1</i>, for example. Would you agree with that?</blockquote>\nDefinitely agree. I'm thinking that AW games are much less focused on mechanical accomplishment and more on actual accomplishments within the fiction. The advancements may have quite a bit of influence over the tone of the campaign; <i>which</i> problems get solved and <i>how.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394566/#Comment_394566" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-23T21:51:36+00:00" title="October 23, 2012  9:51PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's all about the 12+ results.
