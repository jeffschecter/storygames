I'm coming to the end of my current project and would like to turn one of my most recent microrpgs into a more fully fledged product. Which of the 2 appeals to you more, and would you find interesting as a full product rather than a microgame? UNCHAINED or DOWNFALL? (I'm aware that there's another game called DOWNFALL - if it gets chosen I will change the name.) Here are the blurbs for the two games:<br/><br/>UNCHAINED<br/>The world has changed. It's become dark. Dangerous. Terrifying. Even more than you ever thought it could be. And it all started four years ago with the arrival of the Prometheus Mark.<br/><br/>One day, inexplicably, tens of thousands of people around the world woke up with a dark symbol seemingly gouged into their foreheads. Those cursed with what was dubbed the Prometheus Mark would shift dramatically from being either hyper-intellectual or unfathomably strong and powerful.<br/><br/>Then, not long after the marks first appeared, certain "marked" individuals would unpredictably commit heinous acts of ultraviolence as their eyes clouded over and their pupils became strangely pentagonal,without warning or provocation. Others would inexplicably slip into an unresponsive, vegetative state, making themselves easy prey for the savages.<br/><br/>Many of the marked are able to keep their extreme behaviours in check, while many are now hunted by large sectors civilised society. It is a harsh, difficult life for a marked person in a world that hates you. Most live together in "packs" to stay safe and keep their urges in balance.<br/><br/>You are one of the marked.<br/><br/>And it ain't for the faint of heart...<br/><br/>DOWNFALL<br/>The world is dying, of that there is no doubt. The bad thing is taking over and it is winning. The time to save our civilisation is running out, and we are its last chance.<br/><br/>Downfall is a role-playing game set in the pre-apocalyptic near-future.<br/><br/>In Downfall, the players play as children who have gathered together - living and surviving in a broken world that is rotten and dying from within. The setting is created collaboratively between the players and the GM.<br/><br/>Downfall is designed for 3-5 players and each game session should take 2-4 hours.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467219/#Comment_467219" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-25T08:09:55+00:00" title="October 25, 2017  8:09AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't get exactly what Unchained is about.<br/>You describe bits of the setting but, unlike Downfall, you don't really pitch what the game is about.

My apologies - you are right. In UNCHAINED, the players play The Marked- people who woke up suddenly displaying The Mark of Prometheus. Along with the mark, they now have a savage bloodlust which they need to satisfy through acts of rage, savagery and ultraviolence. If they don't satisfy their hunger for savagery for too long they can slip into a vegetative state forever, making them easy prey. If they take it too far in the other direction though, it is a slippery slope into the realm of absolute feral savagery from which there is no recovery. And the closer they get to the edge, the easier it is to slip over it.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467221/#Comment_467221" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-25T08:52:34+00:00" title="October 25, 2017  8:52AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No apologies needed, I'm curious, so I ask irritating questions <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>For example...<br/><br/>Does the game offer any direction to go?

They are quite complimentary and the integration of the two concepts could make for an interesting story if done right.<br/><br/>One of the potentially most fruitful manifestations of combining these concepts is the idea that you could explore both of these perspectives of the same conflict.  The players could build the world together and the group would periodically switch roles between the marked and the children trying to escape or defeat them.  Some interesting questions that arise from this:<br/><br/>- How can you create empathy in the players for beings of such inherent savagery?<br/>- What qualities might children have that would help them defeat the marked?<br/>- What kind of complex relationships, alliances, and betrayals could take place between these opposing groups?<br/>- Could there be a shared goal where the children could free the marked from their curse?<br/>- What is the origin of the curse?<br/>- What kind of culture would arise within each community, what justifications would they come up with for their actions?  What unexpected consequence of this curse or conflict could come about?<br/><br/>Thanks for sharing your ideas with us, I'm excited to hear what comes of this project!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467321/#Comment_467321" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-29T14:40:17+00:00" title="October 29, 2017  2:40PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the kids survival thing.
