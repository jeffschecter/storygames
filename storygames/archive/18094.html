It's about going on a roadtrip, and being open to the possibility of self-discovery. Everyone has ideas about the future, and at least one person abandons those ideas and learns to live in the present moment. The game isn't about conflict, but about reflection and the possibility of a twist in perception.<br/><br/>I'd not call it a kitshoutenketsu game, though, both because that's a new term for me (and not really mine to adopt), and because Ribbon Drive was intentionally designed as a response to conflict-heavy games. I think the article does a good job of pointing out that it'd be difficult to design a Western-influenced* game that didn't engage the conflict-centric 3-act structure - either by emulating it or by explicitly rejecting it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408594/#Comment_408594" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-09T18:54:10+00:00" title="March  9, 2013  6:54PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great examples!

And it doesn't have to start with an OK statement. You can start as a drug addict, a homeless, newly divorced, but in the end; everything comes together instead of one dominating another. You can get insight about your life, fall in love or forgive another person. The story ends with a change, but it doesn't have to be a change on someone's behalf.<br/><br/>I played a rather railroady scenario once where a family was having dinner with a man. They talked about the week that passed, but instead of talking about it, I framed it as scenes. When the scene was over, I jumped back to the dinner talk. As the session went on, information came up about the man that made the players wonder why they were having dinner with him. In the final scene, they realized that they was there to tell him that he was going to die.<br/><br/>An insight.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408629/#Comment_408629" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-10T04:31:00+00:00" title="March 10, 2013  4:31AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I literally do not understand a word you are saying, or how it's relevant to the topic at hand, or in any way a response to what I'm saying.<br/><br/>Apologies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408632/#Comment_408632" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-10T05:07:28+00:00" title="March 10, 2013  5:07AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 11, 2013 1:22AM by Rickard.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kishotenketsu is about using the human ability to puzzle to things together, and when the puzzle is finished, the reader comes to an insight. "Why is she doing that? Who is that boy? *puzzled* Ah, she bought a soda to him. *insight*"<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://oi48.tinypic.com/33thvyv.jpg"/><br/><br/>An insight is nothing more than a <i>change </i>in perspective. Like the link in the first post says, the traditional Western story building technique is about creating conflict to keep interest - about how one person, in the end, dominates another.

If in my poor experience in trying to explain myself in english, I manage to pull this off, then it may become useful to the main topic later. If not, here goes nothing.<br/><br/>I'll probably never know if it's a translation problem or something else, but in spanish and specifically in terms of literary theory, the word <i>conflicto</i> always translated as <i>conflict</i> means much more than just violence or competition. It's universally applied also to situations where there's a struggle and/or a change in the status quo.<br/><br/>Now, though it's always true that there's two opposing forces in a conflict, these aren't always human per se. There's the conflict between man vs. man, but also there's the conflict of man vs. nature, man vs society, the man vs himself and nowadays, the conflict of man vs. technology. <br/><br/>On top of that, the word "man" in all those kinds of conflict is actually used to define "humankind's usual viewpoint about the world" expressed in the form of a character (or group of characters) that the readers identify with. It can even be an alien squirrel which can think two things at once, but nevertheless the readers will identify with it if it's got some trace of emotions, principles and plausible reactions (at lest for us) to the world he/she/it/they live in.<br/><br/>Now, this is the base, but again it isn't as rigid as it seems. And that's the beauty of this theory: you can stretch it for example to the idea that there can be <i>conflict</i> between the way the reader thinks the fictional presented world is/must be and the way the writer's final reveal presents it in the end of the story. And that conflict won't necessarily generate any violence from any side, but is actually engineered by the author to pick up the reader's curiosity and then subtly slapping him in the face with sudden realization, all made to enhance the emotional response of the reader.<br/><br/>So by all means, satanize Combat, Competition and Violence if you want, take them away from your lives and/or fictions, but please, don't do that to old poor Conflict. He's just being totally misunderstood.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408673">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408673/#Comment_408673" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-10T16:43:00+00:00" title="March 10, 2013  4:43PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To me the issue isn't that conflict is bad (or even that fictional violence is bad), just that RPGs (and stories and so on) don't have to be all about conflict 100% of the time.

I think the contrast that is trying to be made is that in a Conflict (even a Man vs Nature Conflict) it is expected that one side (Man or Nature) will win.<br/>  If I understand this correctly, the idea is that there is one aspect (say Man) and that an expectation is setup, but is confounded in the end.<br/>  So, in a man vs nature conflict, it might be that a character is struggling between Man's laws to not steal, and Nature's requirement to eat to survive. Part of good story telling in this paradigm is that this conflict is highlighted and in the end, one of these ultimately wins out (the man steals to get food or dies of hunger), In this example, there is no one fighting against the Man, but there is a conflict.<br/>  While in this other story telling paradigm, the idea is that there is only one viewpoint/side and it is going to proceed in an unpredictable way.<br/>   A man is going home with bread he has stolen. And right before he gets home, he gives it to a homeless family. Here there is no conflict highlighted. It is setting up an expectation, he is going home, will he feed his ill-gotten gains to his family, will the police be waiting for him, etc. The twist being that he gives it away. Nobody won, no one had to subsume their stake in a conflict in order for the other side to win. No viewpoint was proven to be flawed or incorrect except the reader's expectation.<br/>  Clearly in these examples, it is almost the same story, but it is told from a different perspective and a different technique.<br/>  I hope that helps.<br/><br/>Paul,<br/>  I am fascinated by this story-telling technique now, I need to flex my brain cells and figure out how to make this part of my toolkit.<br/>Dave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408770/#Comment_408770" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-11T16:15:46+00:00" title="March 11, 2013  4:15PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>  I am fascinated by this story-telling technique now, I need to flex my brain cells and figure out how to make this part of my toolkit.</blockquote>\nMe too.

Since not just any ad-libbed resolution will suffice, how is the resolution decided?  Does someone plan it before hand?  Does someone have to/get to ad-lib it when the time comes?  Does everyone help decide it when the time comes?  Do we employ mechanics or points or a competitive race to produce a rules-based resolution?  It's tough, because we don't just want to identify a killer, we want to see how the killer's identity connects back to what's already been played.<br/><br/>Honestly, I'd be inclined to GM it old-school.  Come up with a cool secret truth and then pick the right moment to reveal it to the players, foreshadowing all the while.

This would seem to fit the earlier idea that kishoutenketsu narratives feel like jokes.<br/><br/>This would mean that there <i>are</i> workable systems that let people create these sorts of narratives in groups, on the fly.

I think the contrast that is trying to be made is that in a Conflict (even a Man vs Nature Conflict) it is expected that one side (Man or Nature) will win.<br/></blockquote>\nWait, what? hmmm ok, I undestand that if you tell the story of a conflict and make that your main point, then you expect the conflict to be solved, but why is it assumed one side has to win? Hmmm, well, that's totally new to me, I'm wondering if this is some deep cultural difference from my latinoamerican background, peruvian background or just me... I'm used to see conflicts never end, become something else or become unimportant in the light of new situations. Whew, now I see why everybody feels like conflics are becoming old.\n<blockquote><br/>  If I understand this correctly, the idea is that there is one aspect (say Man) and that an expectation is setup, but is confounded in the end.<br/>  So, in a man vs nature conflict, it might be that a character is struggling between Man's laws to not steal, and Nature's requirement to eat to survive. Part of good story telling in this paradigm is that this conflict is highlighted and in the end, one of these ultimately wins out (the man steals to get food or dies of hunger), In this example, there is no one fighting against the Man, but there is a conflict.<br/></blockquote>\nYou see, for me this part is just a premise to start an story, not a full story. It may mean I'm so used to expect a twist that whenever I don't see one, I feel cheated or surprised :P\n<blockquote><br/>  While in this other story telling paradigm, the idea is that there is only one viewpoint/side and it is going to proceed in an unpredictable way.<br/>   A man is going home with bread he has stolen. And right before he gets home, he gives it to a homeless family. Here there is no conflict highlighted. It is setting up an expectation, he is going home, will he feed his ill-gotten gains to his family, will the police be waiting for him, etc. The twist being that he gives it away. Nobody won, no one had to subsume their stake in a conflict in order for the other side to win. No viewpoint was proven to be flawed or incorrect except the reader's expectation.<br/>  Clearly in these examples, it is almost the same story, but it is told from a different perspective and a different technique.<br/>  I hope that helps.<br/></blockquote>\nThanks, it certainly helped me understand the way you think and what you are missing. I can't believe most people here aren't used to play other things than conflicts that solve with one side winning and too little unexpected twists, but I get it. Hmm well, about the violence as default option for players I know what you mean, it happens in my group all the time, but I think it's a side effect of having a game with a ton of combat rules and characters mainly designed for combat, or one where it's so simplified it becomes an easy tool to solve anything.<br/><br/>You're in the right path by turning this into a game mechanic or procedure, since it's what society has made: enforce rules to make violence a less easy option, while giving people better options instead of it. Let me think what I can add to help you there, I'll be back later.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409012/#Comment_409012" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-14T09:24:33+00:00" title="March 14, 2013  9:24AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, I see the use of kishotenketsu in a game in this fashion: First act would present PCs in their own daily routine. Second act would let each player take a part of the world of the other players (a place, an npc or group of them, etc) and give it a twist. Third act would have players trying to meet ends and connect things, sorta Fiasco way. You can built a lot of mystery or a threat in act 2, but act 3 won't necesarily mean a combat or the world destruction. It could mean the player adapts to the new situation and roleplays it as if she knew it all along or whatever she wishes and finds more entertaining.<br/><br/>Wow, that was the shortest game I've ever written. Let me know if you ever get to playtest it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
