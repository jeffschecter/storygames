(There's are still westerns of course but their different now, Lindsay explains it better in her video). <br/><br/>This somehow got me thinking about turn of the century adventure stories, adventure serials, and the general idea of "Modern Adventures." (I'm not sure if there's a genre name or what it is). I was thinking about how it would be fun to play out the whole genre fatigue (or cultural realization if you will) of these sorts of stories. Literally have the characters view of the world and their adventures change over the course of a campaign.<br/><br/><b>The idea</b><br/>There are two main parts of the game.<br/><br/><b>Fantastic Adventures</b><br/>-You play as characters in Adventure stories. You go on "Expeditions" to strange new lands. Both literally strange like <i>Journey to the center of the earth</i> and figuratively exotic far away lands. Then you return home with your artifacts, maps, or trophies etc.<br/><br/><b>Slow disillusionment</b><br/>-The other big part of the game is disillusionment. Basically as bad things happen to the player characters they become somewhat disillusioned with the shiny, carefree adventure quality of the expeditions. But not only failure, its also about the nature of these "discovered lands" and the Native peoples who inhabit them. Slowly the player characters begin to understand the "price" that's being paid.<br/><br/>The beginning expeditions should be very focused on discovery and fun. As the characters become more disillusioned and more inflexible the adventures should become darker, grittier and less carefree.<br/><br/>Characters<br/>The player characters too have more too them, they start as stereotypical adventure archetypes, explorer, big game hunter, archaeologist etc. But more of their hidden drives become apparent, the less ideal motivations behind their drive to go on expeditions. <br/><br/><b>Mechanics.</b><br/>-As characters gain new abilities (level up) they also become more inflexible. <br/>-There is a replenish-able pool of points for the player to add to dice results (or something like that). But these points can also be used to turn a failure into a level up. But then the spent point(s) are gone forever. I want this to mimic characters getting older, more experienced, but also more rigid in thinking. Partially inspired by WarriorMonk's <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21171/special-abilities-with-narrative-rules-instead-of-mechanical-ones#latest" rel="nofollow">thread</a>. <br/><br/>Other than that I'm not sure what sort of system(s) it could be built in or created with.<br/><br/>That's all I have for now.

I clicked on this link thinking that "hey, somebody else's got the life experience where they realize how unhealthily obsessed with the adventure genre roleplaying games can be", and your starting point was seemingly set to approach that issue.<br/><br/>But then, what happened - you went and sketched out a game that ironically rides on the genre <i>enthusiasm</i> of the players. There's deconstruction, sure, but it's a long way from the <i>Watchmen</i> to deciding that superheroes are actually not that exciting for you anymore.<br/><br/>To clarify, I think that actually adventure-critical (or rather adventure-apathetic, perhaps) roleplaying games are an interesting subject matter because of how their fans form a distinct minority within the rpg hobby, and how they pretty much tend to consist of people who grew either genre exhausted with the adventure tropes, or became philosophically cynical about the genre as they grew up. A lot of the exciting new developments in the rpg culture over the last 15 years have been about the emergence of this genre exhaustion, even as adventure is still the clearly dominant paradigm and mainstream culture of roleplaying.<br/><br/>It may be confusing that despite the above, I think that it's a nice game idea. I just got my hopes up for some culture politics due to how you started out [grin].\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" rel="nofollow">Kenny_J</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><b>Mechanics.</b><br/>-As characters gain new abilities (level up) they also become more inflexible. <br/>-There is a replenish-able pool of points for the player to add to dice results (or something like that).

The antagonist needs to be able to tap that common pool of points as well, to establish villainous stuff - you can only recur villains and places that are paid for, for instance. As the setting moves from inchoate "anything can happen but nothing means much" towards more specificity (specific cast of characters, specific locations, specific story tropes) the pool tracks the crystallization of the campaign from a living animal to a dead one.<br/><br/>Also, expanding on the good idea: when a character is failing, the player may level up / define <i>either</i> the character <i>or</i> the opposition. The advantage in doing the former is that you get to pick your strengths that allow you to triumph, while in the latter you get to pick the weaknesses of the opposition.<br/><br/>A central element of the game is that the antagonist provides "challenge" for the adventurer characters, but that this challenge comes in two types: "adventure challenges" arise out of the inchoate genre imagination, while "personal challenges" arise out of whatever has been established about a given character. Leveling-up means that your character gets mechanically established, and <i>anything</i> that is established may be challenged.<br/><br/>The two types of challenge are very different thematically: the former is good clean fun, while the latter is essentially deconstructive, forcing the players to explore the underpinnings of who and what the character is. This means that you'll probably want to have the character advancement be out-of-the-book more than free-traits - you'll want to limit the character concepts to adventure pulp tropes, and provide ready-to-go deconstructions for them.<br/><br/>For example, if a character is established as a "Doctor", it is helpful for the cohesion of the game if the game text supplies the players with possible deconstructive readings like "Is your science merely a veil for the white man's ambition?" or "Does your medicine help people, or merely enforce the status quo?" or "Are you more god than man?" or whatever angle of attack might be pertinent to a given doctor character in their campaign context.<br/><br/>Also, this notion of inchoateness and affixed content causes an interesting grid to form once we compare the character to their antagonism:<br/><br/><b>An inchoate character vs inchoate challenge:</b> Neither the character nor their opposition has been "affixed" yet as regards this situation. It's an opportunity for invention and fresh ideas on both sides. Such ideas are throw-away farthings, but e.g. the pressure of a failure (good idea, that) may force a character to level up towards cohesion, or a grand success on the part of a hero may affix resources, allies, whatever. In such a way is the Property (might be a good term for the overall campaign, that) developed.<br/><br/><b>A fixed character aspect vs inchoate challenge:</b> The character is forcibly deconstructed by their environment. This is like one of those Superman stories where we know who the Superman is, but he's facing some completely new, weird, perhaps unfeasible opposition. Or maybe it's the next Lex Luthor. Either way, the game mechanics should make it distinctive and interesting when you set the fixed properties against the unformed.<br/><br/><b>An inchoate character vs fixed challenge:</b> This is like the adventure stories that revolve around the antagonism rather than protagonism: Fu Manchu, Godzilla and Dracula have all had a rich pulp adventure career where the monster is well-defined while the opposition is just generic "heroes", often easily dispatched in the interests of the plot. However, perhaps in this game being well-defined is an invitation to deconstruct as well?<br/><br/><b>A fixed character vs fixed challenge:</b> This is the real IP development territory, where a given adventure story Property ends up sooner or later. You have your hero, you have your villain, both are familiar to the audience, and you re-enact their eternal battle. There should definitely be special mechanical zing to it when this sort of thing starts occurring. Powerful forces putting pressure on the players to discover the reality beyond the formulaic story: are Batman and Joker forced to always continue their dance to the amusement of the audience?<br/><br/>Perhaps the game's mechanical treatment should make those four cases interesting and different, and support the overall theme by making them matter. At the beginning of play it's all inchoate, while towards the end the game moves more and more into the last box where it's all "Batman vs Joker" all the time, because all the good ideas are already spent and there is nothing new to say about Gotham anymore.<br/><br/>Also, the pressure towards deconstruction needs to be counter-balanced by the benefits of accepting things at their face value: it needs to feel like an accomplishment when the players first manage to trap themselves into a "of course Superman is vulnerable to Kryptonite, and of course everybody uses it all the time" story trope, and it needs to feel like an accomplishment when they play themselves out of it as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464369/#Comment_464369" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-27T14:14:35+00:00" title="June 27, 2017  2:14PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 27, 2017 2:15PM by Kenny_J.">edited June 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, If you want to discuss Adventure genre fatigue in gaming and culture politics that would be very interesting!

Wow Eero, a lot to unpack here!<br/><br/>I agree with your assessment that this idea does rely on <i>enthusiasm </i>with the adventure genre. Like you said this idea sits firmly in the deconstruction phase of genre fatigue, or in other words the transition from fatigue to re-invention, <i>rather</i> than post genre. In my mind this game would sort of tackle that cognitive dissidence of enjoying a trope while acknowledging its nature as a trope while not making it into a joke, then re-inventing the idea during play. At least that's my hope anyway. <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> <br/><br/>Allowing the use of a pool of points to be used by the antagonist, as well as by the players to define the antagonist is a very interesting idea. It would certainly expand the role of the points beyond the scope I was originally thinking, however might better suit my stated intent. And I also agree on out-of-the-book traits. I was thinking along the lines of your doctor example, so I'm glad that idea is coming through.<br/><br/>I'm going to give the rest of your items some more thought. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464376/#Comment_464376" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-27T17:28:21+00:00" title="June 27, 2017  5:28PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To me, the most exciting aspect of this conceptual game would be one of deconstruction.<br/><br/>We start out by (perhaps ironically) celebrating the adventure genre, but, as play goes along, we discover/explore what kind of "genre" we are really playing in.<br/><br/>Perhaps we make decisions along the way (possibly driven by some random creative inputs, like Fiasco's Tilt elements or Tarot card readings or something else that's fairly open-ended), and our game transforms from predictable adventure fiction... to something completely different!<br/><br/>Does it turn dark? Self-reflective?

Perhaps another game has a better name for it. Flags maybe? The thing is that these are words or short phrases that tell us things about the character's personality. Objectives, temperament, hopes, traumas, phobias, bonds, flaws, fame, infamy, etc. In our current game players get XP at the end of the session whenever they roleplay them, and can change them at any time during the session either by GM or player prompt. As a GM I usually suggest a flag when it makes sense for their character at creation, when I notice a tendency the player has in game, when a traumatizing event happens to the character, or when an interesting dynamic develops between two PCs or a PC and a NPC.<br/><br/>Maybe these could be turned back into Fate-like Aspects, I mean, whenever PCs fail they would get to increase negative aspects that then could be used mechanically to get a bonus to the dice roll. It doesn't mean the character can't still have principles, but that they will realize they will get better results by using a less ethic approach to the problem.<br/><br/>Like when Boromir dies all the party gets the flag "All damned orcs deserve to die!" and then they increase it everytime they fail attacking them or when they receive damage from them; but then they also get that bonus when attacking orcs with the intention of outright killing them. The same flag can degrade to "cruel bastard" if the PCs kill too many orcs/the bonus reaches the max. and starts to apply to other sentient beings. Perhaps the degradation process can affect other flags instead and gate the character in conflict, triggering a roleplaying scene where the character talks this with anyone to try to ease their mind and change their flag to something else that makes sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464412/#Comment_464412" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-29T02:13:51+00:00" title="June 29, 2017  2:13AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>, that is indeed an exciting design project. Especially including modular elements of changing mechanics based on tone and evolution of the game as its progressed. You have some interesting ideas about adding mechanical elements, the trouble I see would not be over doing it. Perhaps adding something like sub-genre mechanics, as the game triggers sub genres, a new mechanic kicks in.<br/><br/>Another other way to go is constrain it somewhat and have a sort of set arc of tone, a kind of clock that ticks forward. <br/><br/>I'm thinking of one way to do this, Paul, you said "table C" and this got me thinking. As Eero suggested if we allow the points pool to allow players to establish elements during play, for themselves and antagonists, the total collective pool value can act as a clock. <br/><br/>Here's how it would go, you have a table that determines major plot elements or twists, or some kind of must include element in the current "expedition." You roll and add the unspent pool value, at first its always hitting the typical genre tropy items. But as the modifier changes because players are spending points, different numbers on the table become more likely. Add to that the table is half blank, as a player adds an element, the group writes something on the table, and as more is established (more points spent, higher levels) it becomes increasingly likely that elements written during play come back to haunt the players. Once the points are all but spent it your mostly dealing with stuff you created!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464414/#Comment_464414" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-29T02:27:48+00:00" title="June 29, 2017  2:27AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">@WarriorMonk</a>.

Rather, it would give the group methods to transform the game's genre, and leave room for the players to determine exactly how that happens, collaboratively.<br/><br/>This could mean that the group shifts the tone in *very subtle ways* (it's now just a *slightly different kind* of adventure fiction, like a sequel to a beloved film), or that the tone shifts (as in your example of the "world slowly degrading around the superheroes", above) but then eventually shifts back again (perhaps the superheroes finally manage to turn things around and rescue it after all, returning things back to normal).<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464480/#Comment_464480" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-30T00:22:17+00:00" title="June 30, 2017 12:22AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 30, 2017 12:24AM by Kenny_J.">edited June 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Simonpaulburley" rel="nofollow">Simonpaulburley</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>This is a VERY interesting design concept and worth exploring.

It all depends on what the players establish, and how they react to stuff created. It could very well be that the players enjoy the genre but tweak it a little to have more character depth (or whatever) but don't drown the world in cynicism.  <br/><br/>I see it like this, there are streaming shows like stranger things that are completely steeped in nostalgia and genre, almost to the point of being cookie cutter at times (I love it by the way but it is an undeniably overly nostalgic portrayal). BUT the show feels fresh because the streaming format gives depth to characters a film never could. Its a re-invention of the genre only by virtue of how it spends its time. This game, I hope will be able to do something like that as well as something more extreme. \n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Simonpaulburley" rel="nofollow">Simonpaulburley</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>2) Many, many years ago I had the idea to run a Superhero campaign with the idea that the world would slowly degrade around the heroes.

I keep thinking along these lines if for no other reason than its what I'm most familiar with. But I'm not sure yet. I keep wondering stuff like "should it have classes?" "should it be GMless?" For the moment I'm thinking a GM, but nothings set in stone. I normally don't workshop ideas like this openly online (hence I'm slower to respond), but I wanted to give it a try here. <br/><br/><br/>Keep the ideas (and potential constraints) coming.

Ok, let me try some more ideas here then: the flags will change and evolve through the game. The GM or other players will say when an event affects a character and could give suggestions on how, but it's up to the player how their character handles it and what kind of personality trait they develop, replace, erase or evolve. Whatever they choose they still get XP at the end of the session for roleplaying it, but otherwise it doesn't affect mechanics too much. Perhaps the group could award inspiration to someone for a great roleplaying scene.<br/><br/>Yesterday I was checking a bit of <a href="http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/25820/Classroom-Deathmatch?it=1" rel="nofollow">Classrooom Deathmach</a> as I thought that was where I had seen that pool mechanic as a clock before, but couldn't find evidence for that. However there is an interesting dynamic there: each player chooses a "best friend" and an "enemy" among the other players (dunno if it was here or somewhere else where those players were the ones at your right and left respectively) to have them narrate success and fail whenever you rolled. The game still relies on a facilitator/GM to set obstacles, setbacks and frame the scenes and doesn't have rules to limit the extent of the successes or failures narrated, which play more as a feature than as a bug given the game genre. Perhaps something there could be use if you want to go GM less or GMlite?<br/><br/>Also, I just remembered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B32-Yp38AJo" rel="nofollow">this videogame, Darkest Dungeons</a>, where the player handles an entire party management, not only dealing with their logistic, health and skills but with their mental stability while exploring the dungeon and retrieving treasure. At some points it can become a bet of how much can you push the adventurers to get more profit before they break. Perhaps there could be some more ideas to explore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464667/#Comment_464667" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-06T20:28:34+00:00" title="July  6, 2017  8:28PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm definitely thinking GMlite. Maybe everyone goes in turn and adds elements to the table for any given expedition, and then through play those elements get more complicated by player choice. But everyone adds something.<br/><br/>I like the "best friend" "enemy" bit, perhaps it would become "confidant" and "rival."<br/><br/>The other thing I'm thinking is that there might be an element table for each expedition location, return expeditions to the same location increasingly brings back earlier established elements.  One thing that hasn't been discussed as much is the element of fantastic locations, and I really do mean fantastic. So I'm thinking of broad category locations like "Underworld," "Islands," "deep jungle," "Sky," etc. But I also want to have a phase of the game that takes place back home. There's always a expedition then return where players have to deal with mundane troubles back home. This wouldn't be a long part of the game simply a sort of expedition resolution/transition phase.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464679/#Comment_464679" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-07T01:19:13+00:00" title="July  7, 2017  1:19AM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm, interesting!

And then roleplaying the consequences to determine in which conditions your character starts their next expedition.<br/><br/>Also, something new I'm trying these days is using keywords to improvise locations, monsters, npcs, etc but being careful to <i>always</i> include one Mood among those keywords. It must be an emotion or a vibe, like mystery, horror, solitude, gritty, pacific, etc. Let one mood dominate a single location and prep or improvise everything around it. Background music, images, descriptions, everything goes with the mood.<br/><br/>But also, the mood is either reinforced or changed by the players so, whatever happens, go with the player's mood, reinforce it and take advantage of it, even if that means letting go of your prep. <br/><br/>Keep the questions and feedback coming, at any pace you want, I'll keep shooting things back either if they are of use or not <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464838/#Comment_464838" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-16T05:00:35+00:00" title="July 16, 2017  5:00AM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 16, 2017 5:03AM by Kenny_J.">edited July 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok,<br/><br/>So I have been stewing for a long while on the ideas here and I think I have a more definitive outline.<br/><br/><b>Character Creation</b><br/>Everyone begins as a pulp hero, meaning your already somewhat famous (infamous). Below are lists of things that all the characters begin with.<br/>-Well educated, multiple degrees or comparable life experiences.<br/>-Speak multiple languages.<br/>-Equally talented in formal discourse and fighting alike.<br/>-Fairly wealthy (or the appearance of wealth).<br/>-Well traveled.<br/><br/>Players begin by picking from a list of traits, a mix of occupations, hobbies, talents, skills. Generally these will be work like the "flags" or "aspects" as we discussed earlier. These will define the characters backgrounds, abilities, and common modus operandi. <br/><br/>There should also be player goals, at the beginning these should primarily be bringing back some kind of treasure, trophy, or proof to the civilized world. Later this might become more complicated but at the beginning it should be things like "The skull of the legendary animal," "fossils that prove the existence of _____," "A huge legendary diamond"<br/><br/>Then the players talk about their characters and how they interrelate. Talk about how they came to go on expeditions together. Talk about what each of the characters bring to the team. Think too about how goals connect for each expedition.<br/><br/>Remember to come up with a long form name and an adventurer title <br/><br/><b>Mechanics, resolution method, scene framing.</b><br/><br/><b>Expeditions</b><br/>The expedition location will based on character goals, it should be exotic and currently "undiscovered." Each location has a prevailing tone and description. At this phase everyone should openly talk about what there characters would be looking for here, rumors, potential pitfalls and dangers.<br/><b><br/>Scene's</b><br/>Each expedition will consist of a specific set of scenes. Scenes should begin already in process, think along the lines of "We find our heroes hacking through vines and underbrush deep in the jungle when..." or "We find our heroes in the clutches of..." <br/><br/>For now they will be:<br/>-<i>Exposition:</i> What we really found when we arrived and setup base camp. This should be done opening with everyone discussing the tone and description of the setting. Emphasis on adding visceral detail and future complications.<br/><br/>-<i>Inciting indecent:</i> This is where the main problem arises. The heroes may "win" or "lose" but the final goal remains out of their grasp.<br/><br/>-<i>Climax:</i> The final battle or final location. The players on the cusp of glory. This should be a larger than life set piece scene. The set piece should be the epitome of the type of location, a huge cavern or tomb for the underworld, a ruined city in the deep jungle etc. <br/><br/>-<i>Return:</i> The players describe an epilogue of returning from the expedition with their trophies, wealth, or findings. This should bring tangible success but there are always critics who question the validity of the story.<br/><br/><b>Mechanical Resolution</b><br/>There are no stats, only traits/aspects, when an dangerous obstacle arises, or a stated action is in question the players pick which trait they want to use (traits do not stack) and then roll 2d6. <br/><br/>-<i>Luck points:</i> They players may also choose to add points to a roll from a pool of luck points. These are used up and replenished upon rest.<br/><br/>-<i>The roll:</i> A typical pbta 10+, 7-9, 6- result list. The interpreted results take their cue from the chosen trait. There are also points to one of the counters. For example "on a 7-9 add a point to the dark counter", on a 6 or bellow add two dark points to the counter". On good results you add light points to the counter which can be used to add positive elements to the scene. <br/><br/>-<i>Untrained traits: </i>The players may choose to use a trait that is not on their sheet but the outcomes are considered fumbling and ungraceful.   <br/><br/>-<i>Learn a hard lesson/level up:</i> If the player fails the roll they may instead choose to "learn a hard lesson." They may permanently spend a luck point to gain a new trait from the "Hard lesson" list. These look a lot more like character moves in traditional pbta games. They spent points are lost forever. The chosen "hard lesson" is also added to a global counter that affects the whole game. These need to be valuable enough to have the player choose the lesson over the point pool.<br/><br/><b>Game evolution</b><br/><i>For this area the ideas are there but not exactly what it would look like, more development needed.</i><br/><br/>There is a series of lists that are used to set up, and add elements to future scenes. When the counter is full, they players choose an element from the list. Once a chosen element is used, it can't be used again (at least not until all current elements have been used once).<br/><br/>Whenever a player "learns a hard lesson" they add a corresponding aspect to the game. For example the player may choose to learn "Death is real, and it could happen to me" this adds death to the element list. Now when the counter is full the players can choose this element to add a scene.<br/><br/>There might be new counters as well, and perhaps the players can choose to add a dark or light point to whichever counter they choose.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464855/#Comment_464855" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-16T13:48:03+00:00" title="July 16, 2017  1:48PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 16, 2017 1:53PM by David_Berg.">edited July 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not sure I fully get this idea, but I just want to throw out a quick reaction and an alternative approach.<br/><br/>A predetermined arc of disillusionment doesn't excite me, nor does a mechanical toolkit for whatever sort of genre drift the group just happens to do naturally.  Something in between might, though:\n<ul>Suppose you have a pile of cards out on the table where everyone can see them, representing all the antitheses of pulp adventuring.<br/><br/>Death.  Failure.  Ruin.  Tragedy.  Chaos.  Boredom.  Meaninglessness.  Drudgery.  Despair.  Shame.<br/><br/>That pile is the destination which the players can approach, in part or in total, while they play.  The decision to go there or not is explicit and we all know what "there" looks like.<br/><br/>The rationale for taking a card from the pile and putting it into play could be whatever you, the designer, deem appropriate.  Is it about what the players want next, or about what they've already done?  Does it require consensus or just one player?  Is there some struggle, adversity provided by the game, forcing you to "earn" a card, or is it pure player choice?  (I think your answers to these questions will largely shape the experience of play.)<br/><br/>Once a card is in play, introduce whatever rules/mechanical changes/additions you've designed to fit.</ul>\nAnyway, that's just what sounds fun to me.  I hope there's something in there that's useful to you!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464867/#Comment_464867" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-17T03:18:06+00:00" title="July 17, 2017  3:18AM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the idea of cards if for no other reason than they are very visible and the visceral aspect of picking them up. I think this actually fits perfectly into what I was thinking for the lists. Cards could say a concept like you suggest and the trigger for placing a card in the center of the table would be a "hard lesson" chosen by a player. The trigger for picking one and putting one into play would be a dark or light counter filled up with points from dice results. The players would collectively decide which card to put into play.<br/><br/>In my mind the rational for placement would be what the players have already done, in terms of a consequence to established fiction, but also what the players want in terms of a broader game experience, i.e. where would it be fun to go with this game. <br/><br/>Thanks for your thoughts and suggestion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464873/#Comment_464873" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-17T22:45:36+00:00" title="July 17, 2017 10:45PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 17, 2017 10:46PM by David_Berg.">edited July 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" rel="nofollow">Kenny_J</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>the trigger for placing a card in the center of the table would be a "hard lesson" chosen by a player.

By doing so they gain a new ability but also put a new element in play. It would shift things a bit, but I might also add a escalating trigger and people grabbing cards from the table. <br/><br/>I really like the idea of a card in this instance because any new design elements and hard lesson stuff will all be in one place<br/><br/>Hmmmm..........                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464881/#Comment_464881" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-18T12:14:38+00:00" title="July 18, 2017 12:14PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" rel="nofollow">Kenny_J</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>when a player fails and wants to learn a hard lesson</p></div></blockquote>Personally, I'd find the game more compelling if it weren't up to the player to decide when a failure should trigger a hard lesson.  I liked the sound of die results (or something) adding up to a "hard lesson moment" over time.<br/><br/>Unless there's some semblance of fictional causality, or at least fiction-related causality, it seems like just a periodic reminder to check in on tone.  Which is fine if that's what you want!  The other idea is more my taste, though.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464883/#Comment_464883" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-18T17:56:45+00:00" title="July 18, 2017  5:56PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The hard lesson is proceeded by character failure, the players choice in this is which failures lead to hard lessons.

For instance, maybe when your character "levels up", you have to write up a new "tone card".<br/><br/>* Have another procedure for introducing one of these, and tie it to something in the fiction.<br/><br/>An example:<br/><br/>We're playing a happy adventure game. I want to "level up", so I write a card which says, "Plague, pestilence, and disease. Someone falls ill or is revealed to be carrying a deadly sickness or infection."<br/><br/>When a character suffers "death", we can say that the character returns to the story later (they only appeared to be dead).<br/><br/>However, to do so, you draw two "tone cards", and choose one to keep.<br/><br/>The player on your left decides whether the effect written on the card applies to you or to whoever or whatever caused your "death".<br/><br/>From now on, the GM (or maybe everyone) has the means to introduce disease or pestilence into your game, and we find out that the men who "killed" you are all infected with a new plague which is spreading through the kingdom (or that your character suffers from a deadly illness, and will need to seek out a cure).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
