The players seemed engaged and focused. They got into their roles and played with aplomb. All this despite my incomplete planning and some railroading. I'll write up a proper AP soon. This is just a lead-in.<br/><br/>I kinda ran out of time before Camp Nerdly and didn't finish my planning. I had some sweet color city maps with important locations marked -- these turned up in another folder later on, but I wish I had had them for the game. I somehow didn't print the character sheets for John Dee. I ran the combats ad hoc based on some encounter notes. <br/><br/>I railroaded the party into the final encounter at the cathedral. At least I warned folks that I was gonna do this before we started play. It's D&amp;D and some amount of "here's the dungeon, dummies" often occurs, especially in con play. One player even questioned his character's motivations for caring about the cathedral encounter.<br/><br/>My least proud moment of the game was calling for a Perception roll to find a bucket in the nearby houses. Wow. Moments after saying it, I realized it was perhaps the worst call I'd ever made as a GM in thirty years of playing D&amp;D. I told the group as much, we had a laugh about it, and I gave the party their fucking bucket and let the highest roller find a pair of magical slippers instead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210170/#Comment_210170" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-03T10:02:34+00:00" title="June  3, 2009 10:02AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2009 10:07AM by Adam_Dray.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The conceit of the Metrocalypse setting is that a city from Earth's real history gets plunged into the D&amp;D universe and besieged by monsters and aggressive wilderness. A handful of very special people find themselves transforming into strange heroes. They gain the powers of D&amp;D classes and some transform physically into D&amp;D races. The players take these roles, of course. The vast majority of the Earth citizenry are normal folks. <br/><br/><b>Characters</b><br/><br/>I'd created a bunch of characters for the game to speed play. They were all famous English people from around 1600: William Shakespeare, Sir Walter Raleigh, John Dee, Edward Kelley, Queen Elizabeth, Thomas Hobbes, and Arthur Lake. Olaf had personally requested Arthur Lake; I had chosen all the rest. In most cases, I statted up two versions of each character. I gave the players a cheat sheet that listed each character's name, race, class, and combat role. The players got to do a little bit of "party planning" by choosing which roles they wanted to fill the group. For example, Clinton chose to play the striker (tiefling rogue) version of Edward Kelley. I think the party ended up having numerous leader roles (including human cleric Arthur Lake, dragonborn warlord Sir Walter Raleigh, and gnome bard William Shakespeare). <br/><br/>Some of the characters had interesting twists, too. I left it up to Kelley's player to decide if he was a ridiculous con man or actually able to converse with angels. I latched onto the conspiracy theory it was actually the Earl of Oxford who wrote Shakespeare's plays. <br/><br/>By the time I got back from changing out of jeans and into shorts, the table had filled up and everyone was pretty firm on their roles. I created the characters using the DDI Character Builder, which is an awesome tool. I also wrote about a page of biographical information for each character. This explained a little about the character's history, how they came to be in Oxford, and connections with other characters. For example, I had to explain why Elizabeth was alive in 1605 (she died in 1603) and how Raleigh got out of the London Tower, where King James had imprisoned him, and how Edward Kelley didn't actually die during his escape from a Bavarian emperor's castle.<br/><br/>I gave the players my 1" circle punch and had them punch out the portraits I'd included on their character sheets. I hastily modge-podged them onto wood cutouts I had painted blue, and everyone had a custom miniature/pog with their character's face on it. It was cool seeing Gloriana Elizabeth moving around the battle map next to the likes of Shakespeare and Hobbes. None of these portraits depicted them as other than human, though. It would have been awesome to have Edward Kelley as a devil (tiefling), but such pictures are not readily available on the Internet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210173/#Comment_210173" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-03T10:18:18+00:00" title="June  3, 2009 10:18AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>First Encounter: Meeting the Mayor</b><br/><br/>This is an encounter I used in my home campaign. The group learns that <a href="http://www.headington.org.uk/oxon/mayors/1603_1714/bryan_richard_1605.htm" rel="nofollow">Richard Bryan, the Mayor of Oxford in 1605</a> is holed up in his tavern, the Bear Inn, on Alfred Street with survivors of the metrocalypse. The party goes to help the mayor but the guards won't let a dragonborn and tiefling in and doesn't believe some of the folks are who they say they are. The Queen died two years ago!<br/><br/>I ran this as a skill challenge and reminded them that, if they fail, there's a back entrance they could sneak into. In general, I am not terribly proud of this encounter, though it was fun. It could have been more fun and actually important to the plot if I had planned better. As it was, it was more of an "establish the setting" encounter with no real value. Nonetheless, I suspect Clinton will never forget fast-talking his devil-formed Edward Kelley into the Bear Inn, or the peasants screaming in fear at Kelley's appearance.<br/><br/>If I had it to do again, I would have first established the main thrust of the adventure: to get to Christ Church Cathedral and determine what happened to Oxford (and maybe do something about it). Then I could make the Bear Inn encounter a source of information that would aid the players in the later encounter. If they failed the skill challenges, then they could still go to the Cathedral, but without the extra information that might help them along. <br/><br/>As it was, the encounter wasn't meaningful. I wanted them to talk to the mayor and I handwaved it when they actually failed the skill challenge. Shakespeare's "We are all costumed actors in a play" ruse was so hilarious and clever that I let them in anyway. If Sandy hadn't come up with that, they might have sneaked in a window or back door, or the mayor would have come out. Stupid, unnecessary, illusionist play (the players were aware I was doing this).<br/><br/>In the end, they talked to the mayor about the events and the encounter served its main purpose. I wanted the players to be thinking about why the metrocalypse had happened and how their characters felt about it. I also wanted to drive home that the bizarre transformations some of them had undergone were repugnant and scary to most other people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210175/#Comment_210175" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-03T10:25:21+00:00" title="June  3, 2009 10:25AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Reading the background for this, Adam, you are a man after my own heart.

Queen Elizabeth, faerie queen (eladrin shaman), made some Nature checks and found a nearby well. The heroes would need to clear a path to it, meaning a combat encounter.<br/><br/>I totally created this encounter ad hoc, though I had prepared notes on some reasonable encounters for a 2nd level party. I reskinned a bunch of kobolds as "little, hairless, impish men with very angry, scrunched-up faces," and dropped five kobold minions in front of them, then three kobold dragonshields (soldiers), a kobold slinger, and a kobold wyrmpriest behind the line of minions. <br/><br/>The encounter took place on the streets of Oxford. I have two sets of the city tiles from Wizards of the Coast and I laid out a long stretch of street with some alleys and a couple buildings alongside the intersection. I warned the players that the streets were choked by jungle trees and underbrush and that everyone had concealment from ranged attacks unless they were within 2-3 squares. <br/><br/>The combat went well. It gave players a chance to wrap their heads around their characters and, in some cases, 4E rules (several players had never played 4E). It wasn't a particularly tough encounter and the heroes mopped up the bad guys quickly. Memorably, Shakespeare mooned the slinger, who had crawled up onto a roof to get visibility for slingpot attacks, and this so distracted the imp that it fell off the roof and died (this was an attack with a slide 3 power). Reverend Arthur Lake held out his cross and with glowing holy light, overcame the glowing red evil enchantments the wyrmpriest had placed on the imps.<br/><br/>When it was clear that the PCs were going to win, I asked them if they wanted to fight to the bitter end or let the remaining imps (the wyrmpriest and two of the dragonshields) run away. They decided to capture the wyrmpriest and question him. I am pleased that no one tortured him or summarily executed him. They did put a leash on him and dip him into the well to test the water, but they released him into the mayor's custody when they were done.<br/><br/>With the kobolds -- er, imps -- vanquished, they found the well. Hobbes and Lake used their knowledge of the Archimedes Screw to build a wondrous wooden contraption that could pump the water out of the well and down a wooden aqueduct to the Inn for the Oxfordians. I did this as a single Arcana skill check for Hobbes, but allowed each of the other players to jump in with Aid Another. Raleigh contributed Athletics by climbing the woodwork and doing the hard labor. Lake contributed his History knowledge of the Greek device. Other folks jumped in similarly. Hobbes' roll succeeded marvelously and they provided clean water to the people of Oxford.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210183">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210183/#Comment_210183" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-03T10:46:26+00:00" title="June  3, 2009 10:46AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Third Encounter: Exploring Christ Church Cathedral</b><br/><br/>This was the start of the real meat of the adventure. I needed to get the party to the Cathedral, so I railroaded the fuck out of them. Back at the well, I told everyone they felt a chill down their spine and heard whispering. Arthur Lake specifically heard a ghostly voice in his head: "They mixed our bones together! Release me and I will release Oxford!" or something like that. I let the players know that the characters who knew Oxford best would know where to go, etc. Christ Church Cathedral, where the bones of St. Frideswide, the patron saint of Oxford, were supposedly kept.<br/><br/>It didn't take a lot of convincing after that to get the players to agree to have the PCs explore the Cathedral, probably because I told them I was railroading them.<br/><br/>I showed them pictures of the outside of the Cathedral and pulled out the map of the inside I'd found on the Internet. From this, I drew a roughly-to-scale map of the main Cathedral, with its main chapel full of pillars, the Latin chapel full of crypts, and the records room off to the side of the main chapel. When they entered the big doors to the main chapel, I showed them real pictures of the inside of the Cathedral. I think these visual aids are magical.<br/><br/>They decided to explore the records room first, probably because it was behind the only closed doors on the map or because the doors were close to the entrance. Inside the small room was a long table and two ghastly scholars sitting and reading. They appeared to be pale lepers and (as History checks proved) they were wearing 13th Century monks' clothes. They also mouthed words to them without speaking aloud. The players made Perception checks to read lips; they were reading some Bible verse from Revelations. I didn't get specific (I wish I had prepared a verse!) but saying "Revelations" evoked a lot of "oh crap! that's not good!" from the players anyway.<br/><br/>The scholars stood up and came towards Kelley and Lake. Lake jumped back away from the door and slammed it. Kelley just waited and watched. One of these undead scholars phased through the door and approached Reverend Lake menacingly. The other walked up to Kelley and tried to "kiss" him by eating his face. <br/><br/>A battle ensued. Lake got to pull out all kinds of awesome Protestant cross-wielding mojo. They mobbed the undead scholars and brought them down eventually, but not before a line of ten skeletons (minions) appeared. The encounter was designed to weaken them and blow some of their encounter and daily powers. They probably wouldn't get an extended rest before the main encounter...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210188/#Comment_210188" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-03T11:14:53+00:00" title="June  3, 2009 11:14AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Fourth and Final Encounter: St. Frideswide and Lady Montecute</b><br/><br/>After wiping out the undead in the main chapel, they explored the rest of the Cathedral, especially the Latin chapel, a skinny area with three crypts along one side and a large crypt at the far end. The side crypts contained various dignitaries, including Lady Montecute. The end crypt contained, theoretically, the bones of St. Frideswide, the patron saint of Oxford. <br/><br/>Lake searched for information on Frideswide. I gave him a two-sheet history I'd pulled off the net. St. Frideswide had founded the chapel here six hundred years ago. As a saint, she protected the city. It left out some important details, though, like the fact that the Protestants had taken the Frideswide relics (her bones) and put them away when Cardinal Wolsey took over the Cathedral under Henry VIII's reign at the start of the Reformation. Nor did it mention that a Protestant nun, Catherine Cathie Dammartin, a former nun and latter wife of the Zwinglian Regius Professor of Divinity, Canon Peter Martyr Vermigli, had been buried there instead. Nor did it mention that when Queen Mary took the throne, the Catholics had dug up Catherine Cathie and had her moved out of the Cathedral and restored their Saint's bones to the Latin Chapel. Finally, it did not mention how the Protestants had taken power back under Queen Elizabeth, and James Calfhill had dug up both ladies' bones and with a sneer, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06303b.htm" rel="nofollow">mixed them together</a> to put an end to all this digging up business (and to piss off the Catholics).<br/><br/>This true fact, I had decided, was too sweet and rich to pass up, and it had formed the crux of the adventure. When the heroes found the secret compartment in the Latin Chapel and discovered the bones in the dirt in the bottom (two sets, including two skulls), St. Frideswide's ghost appeared to them and demanded they put the Cathedral back to its rightful glory as a place for Catholic worship. <br/><br/>In prepping the adventure, I had worried about imposing any kind of religious moral on the story. I didn't want to take sides in what is certainly a REAL point of contention among Anglicans and Catholics. I decided that the players had several choices. They could take St. Frideswide's side and reconsecrate the chapel (I could always have Catherine Cathie's ghost appear!). They could remain faithful Protestants and defeat the ghost in combat. They could try to parlay with the ghost and talk her down. <br/><br/>Thomas Hobbes was the only one who wanted to reconsecrate the Cathedral. He found the rites in a book in the library and set about doing so. I told his player that it would only work if Hobbes honestly and truly believed he was converting to Catholicism. He said yes. Reverend Arthur Lake couldn't even remain in the building, he was so upset.<br/><br/>But right before he finished the ritual, the rest of the party decided to attack St. Frideswide's ghost. A big combat ensued. St. Frideswide caused Lady Montecute's body to rise up in aid. Hobbes joined the undead in protecting the Catholic Cathedral. Party vs. Party combat. Whee!<br/><br/>St. Frideswide fell quickly, partly due to the rogue's super-striker daily powers. Lady Montecute lasted longer, much thanks to Hobbes using invoker healing abilities on the (now allied) undead. This combat lasted about 6 rounds, I think. Eventually, both the undead (reskinned wights) had fallen and Hobbes stated that now that his Saint was gone, he refused to fight other people.<br/><br/><b>Epilogue</b><br/><br/>I gave the players a choice: Either killing St. Frideswide's ghost caused Oxford to go back to Earth or it irrevocably trapped them here. They chose the latter. Queen Elizabeth for certain did not benefit from returning to the Earth timeline (where she was dead). Others like Sir Walter Raleigh and Edward Kelley didn't want to go back to prison.

I'm running Metrocalypse: Oxford 1605 as a campaign for five players, all of whom made up their own characters. None of them chose to be anyone famous, though it was an option. I prefer to let players create their own characters, as it improves engagement and commitment. And, really, a large part of the Step On Up component of D&amp;D is the character build. <br/><br/>Using pre-gens worked for the con game worked great. The players quickly grokked their characters' powers and abilities and jumped into combat and noncombat encounters with enthusiasm. They integrated information from the one-page blurbs here and there. They seemed to relish being someone you might have read about in history, like Shakespeare or Queen Elizabeth. Thomas Hobbes' player (Josh Riley?) really jumped into his role, expounding in character on the state of nature and other philosophical questions. I felt that the players internalized the historical roles when making choices, even in combat.<br/><br/>One thing I did was leave certain decisions about the character up to the player. I just made it ambiguous in the bio and let the player determine the truth.<br/><br/>I'd avoid having players create characters for a con game because it takes about two or three hours.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210208">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210208/#Comment_210208" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-03T12:34:50+00:00" title="June  3, 2009 12:34PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I forgot to mention my moment of <b>sheer panic</b> when I realized that Olaf Davis not only was a RL Englishman, but also lived in Oxford.

That being said, I think making his ability to persuade people of things largely dependent on his Diplomacy was problematic, given that the character essentially had none.

Like, all games produce narrative, so I'm not sure if you mean "story" or if you mean "Story Now." Also, since I have only run this with 4E, I have no other data points for comparison. I can only guess what 4E's influence on play was.<br/><br/>Combat showcased a bunch of different stuff. <br/><br/>First, combat had challenging elements. The players got to be bad-asses and see their smart tactical choices pay off. However, I wasn't driving as hard as I could with encounters. I don't have the Monster Manual in front of me, but I suspect the first kobold encounter is about a 700 XP encounter, so more suitable as a tough encounter for a 1st level party of 5 characters, not a 2nd level party of 6 characters. It was a pretty average encounter for this group. The later encounters were a little tougher, but not terribly life-threatening. A couple characters did get walloped and had to heal up to stay in the game, but they were fighting another PC (Hobbes, who sided with the Catholics at the end). I obviously hadn't planned that. In short, the encounters were designed to be interesting but not deadly. Step On Up was not my primary goal here.<br/><br/>Second, combat had premise-addressing elements. There were a handful of places where players were asked to bring some judgment to the table, but I suspect it was done through the lens of their characters, so I hesitate to take this seriously as an indicator of creative agenda.<br/><br/>Last, combat offered many places to show off the world and the quirks of these specific characters. Hobbes was willing to risk everything to make things right because (the player explained) he couldn't stand all this chaos. Elizabeth wanted to kill the ghost because she wanted to stay (alive) in this world. Raleigh supported his queen. Kelley liked being a fallen angel (devil) too much and felt he'd found his true form finally. The choice of "do we fight or do we talk" was framed in a way that made players make decisions for their characters. But like I said above, each player seemed to make these decisions through the lens of his or her character. I was reskinning monsters in the Cathedral to make them feel like things from Oxford, even if they were undead things. <br/><br/>I don't know if "interesting plot points occurred on the battle map." Depends on what you mean by plot points. For my money, here are the major plot points:<br/><br/>1. Heroes awaken in Oxford Metrocalypse. Form a group of likeminded folks.<br/>2. Heroes hear about the mayor and his survivors and decide to go meet him.<br/>3. They find the Bear Inn blocked by a guard. They barely convince him to let them talk to the mayor. Heroes discuss metrocalypse origins and theology.<br/>4. More practically, though, people need clean water. Heroes agree to help.<br/>5. They're besieged by imps on the street. Fight them.

That being said, I think making his ability to persuade people of things largely dependent on his Diplomacy was problematic, given that the character essentially had none. I remember trying to reason with the guard at the inn in the first encounter, being asked to roll, and realizing I couldn't possibly succeed. I mean, yes, I improvised a vague historical analogy to use history instead, but it was weird to be playing someone who would eventually become a famous scholar who couldn't win an argument with a meathhead soldier.</blockquote>\nMy friend Daniel Levine is a player in my Metrocalypse home campaign. He statted and wrote up Hobbes on a whim for me. In 1605, Hobbes was a young student at Oxford, and he hadn't really come into his own as a philosophy giant. His "state of nature" stuff, Daniel points out, wasn't formulated yet. <br/><br/>Prepping characters, I was trying to do a good job of niche protection, and we had Diplomacy well covered. One could make a case for a high Diplomacy skill for every one of those characters. <br/><br/>Nonetheless, I can see how this would be frustrating for you! This had to create situations where the implausibility of the situation was too much for you to bear. I think that alone says a lot about what kind of game this was, in terms of creative agenda and stuff.<br/>\n<blockquote>I don't think Olaf posts here, so I will relay what he told me: largely, I think it comes down to the fact that the events started well after the transformations were complete, whereas he was expecting more of a run-up to the outbreak of total weirdness. I think he designed his character's backstory assuming there'd be more discussion between players about what was happening, and a tad less "you all know each other, go fight". He and I both understand the limitations of the con game format, though.</blockquote>\nI have to admit I was surprised to get a character request for this game! Olaf was the only person to send me a specific request. I had never heard of Arthur Lake until Olaf asked me to stat him up as a cleric. I had no idea that Olaf had created any kind of backstory for Lake himself. I had written something up, of course, as I did for all the others.<br/><br/>I can't remember how strongly I dropped the "you all know each other" thing on the table. It is way more convenient for con play, of course, but if the group had pushed back about it, I'd have been happy to let you muddle through getting to know each other. That kind of play is usually dull and weird, though. Also, many of you did already know each other, historically, and I captured this in the one-page bios. Lake was historically a favorite of Queen Elizabeth's, for example. Elizabeth famously loved and protected Raleigh and Dee. Dee and Kelley were best buds until they wife-swapped. Hobbes and Shakespeare were the odd men out, but I wrote in sneaky connections between Shakespeare and Elizabeth (the Earl of Oxford stuff).<br/><br/>If you (or Olaf) mean that it'd have been fun to play out the transformation process more, I hadn't considered that. I sorta dropped you into the game with, "So a few weeks ago the world changed and you realized you had these new powers." In my mind, that meant you didn't have to hamstring yourself in character. I figured you had brand new characters with powers you didn't necessarily understand out-of-character, and that was hamstringing enough.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210317/#Comment_210317" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-04T09:53:31+00:00" title="June  4, 2009  9:53AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You've given me a lot of what I was looking for.

The premise is a great way to mash up historical figures and D&amp;D awesome.<br/><br/>I hope I'm using my terminology right. Theory's not my strenght. What influenced your choice of D&amp;D4 for this? Was "step on up" an important consideration? In what ways did the choice of historical setting enhance step on up play, and in what sense did it impede it? I ask because D&amp;D4 is a bit of a difference choice of system from Pincipia (it started as a TSOY variant and warped from there).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211158/#Comment_211158" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-09T14:53:43+00:00" title="June  9, 2009  2:53PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love playing D&amp;D 4E but don't like the default setting.

There's a kind of irony in playing 4E with a character from Jacobean England or Medieval Japan or whatever.<br/><br/>I suspect that Metrocalypse drifts 4E towards Sim play and that's part of its appeal to me.
