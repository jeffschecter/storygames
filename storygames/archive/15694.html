Each of them is a sticky note on a board. They're waiting in a column called "Waiting quests".<br/><br/>When the players decide to go on a quest, they take the note and put it in the "Active quests" column. They can have up to three active quests going at any one time, and they can finish them in whatever order fits.<br/><br/>When a quest is done, they put the note in the "Give us XP" column. Yay XP!<br/><br/>At any time, the GM makes sure there are three or four quests wayting in the "Waiting quests" column, so the players can pull one off the stack when there's room in the "Active quests" column.<br/><br/>So - a pull-based campaign setup idea that visualizes the flow of adventure.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355886/#Comment_355886" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-25T07:53:30+00:00" title="January 25, 2012  7:53AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really love it!<br/><br/>It'd work for a game like Dungeon World easily enough and you could scale quests so some were easily achievable in a single session and others were much more long-term.<br/><br/>"Slay a monster without using any weapons" vs. "Take over the kingdom"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Donovan" title="Zachary_Donovan"><img alt="Zachary_Donovan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Donovan">Zachary_Donovan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355894/#Comment_355894" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-25T08:42:53+00:00" title="January 25, 2012  8:42AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now I want to know:<br/><br/>Can you apply Extreme Programming to RPGs?

The quest lists aren't so organized (usually it's just one big list), but in my head I always pick out a few and work on them at the same time, usually because they're located in the same geographical area.<br/><br/>I really like the idea of using this in the fiction, as well as out of the fiction. Imagine a world in which adventurers really do gather at a tavern, and there's a giant cork-board of sorts covered in parchments detailing quests from the locals. Whenever a particular group takes on a quest, they move it to their "in progress" board, as if to say "we got this." When they complete the quests, they move the parchments to their "completed" board, to be kept like trophies. There would even be a place for quests that no one is allowed to own, but instead open to whichever adventuring group completes it first. It's a big deal when a quest is put up on the open board, because they're usually The parchments, of course, are considered sacrosanct. Anyone meddling with them would be dealt some very harsh punishment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lin_fusan" title="lin_fusan"><img alt="lin_fusan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lin_fusan">lin_fusan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355905/#Comment_355905" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-25T10:11:38+00:00" title="January 25, 2012 10:11AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You could go agile.<br/><br/>Write user stories and assign story points for complexity.

But it's actually based on a physical production methodology that was then sort of adopted/transformed for the software industry. I first ran across the Kanban methodology about 15 years ago while doing contracting work for a Very Large Japanese Automotive Manufacturer. The VLJAM actually had produced little text books about their manufacturing methodology, Kaizen (incremental improvement) and Kanban (production record cards), that were wonderful introductions/backgrounds to the subject -- apparently the methodology went back a long way (iirc) in Japan prior to the VLJAM getting into the AM part of the business.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_356047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356047/#Comment_356047" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-26T09:37:07+00:00" title="January 26, 2012  9:37AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've always thought this type of approach would make a standard fantasy D&amp;D type game much more engrossing.

Except a lot more organized and probably giving a more reliable result.  <br/><br/>It went like this: if there was time, the GM would often produce several adventures, and the players would choose among them.  Mostly, these adventures would be single session, which was kind of necessary since this was club play and it was difficult to be sure who would be there week-to-week.  But sometime they'd be multi-session and even overlap.  The real limitation, though, was the time to prepare adventures, since in our circles using purchased adventures was both impractical (because of house rules and detailed home-brewed settings) and would have been considered rather tacky.  Now, a lot of more recent games (and since I'm talking the mid to late 70's and early 80's here, most everything is more recent!) do make GM prep easier.  This might make <i>ideas</i> for quests sort of the choke point.  Of course, even in those antediluvian days, players often had things they wanted to do or investigate, which led to specific adventures.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_356059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356059/#Comment_356059" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-26T10:36:40+00:00" title="January 26, 2012 10:36AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I love this.

When some NPC asks the PCs to do something or a PC makes an epic declaration of intent, we clarify the victory condition and its XP award, write all that on a tented card, and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/Inkslinger/status/157326900161818626/photo/1" rel="nofollow">hang it off my DM screen.</a> <br/><br/>There's no formal active list or backlog, though.
