I intentionally over-wrote because I knew I'd be cutting out a lot with the help of my editor. I'm just curious, as a straw poll, how long you think is too long for an RPG book, in terms of page length.<br/><br/>If you need to, you can break it down by audience. For example, the page count <i>Happy Birthday, Robot!</i> is modeled on a long-ish children's book like <i>Polar Express</i> because the target age group for the game is 10 and up. I imagine a longer page count would be reasonable for an older audience, but maybe not.

This may, or may not, involve providing setting material as well as mechanics.<br/><br/>To a large degree, I think the decision needs to be motivated by one other question: is this a "one book and out" project? If so, then this may lead you to provide <i>more</i> material in the game book, because your intention is not to produce more material after the fact.<br/><br/>If your intention is to provide a series, limited or not so limited, then I think your first book needs to hook the players and provide them with what they need to know to play the game for one to four months (wether serially or "at least three or four times" if separately), and as such can afford to provide the players with a solid starting point that's intended, out of the box, to be expanded later on (either mechanically, or thematically).<br/><br/>I look at the fourth edition Players Handbook and I wonder, "what could I possibly cut out of this book without breaking the group's play experience", and I must come to the conclusion, "hardly anything at all". I look at the fourth edition of the HERO System Rules, and I ask the same question, and, actually, come to pretty much the same answer. But both these games depend heavily upon achieving freshness and variety out of specific, rules-bound, modular, mechanical description and so, inevitably, these games must have a certain degree of 'catalog' to them, and to provide richness, catalogs cannot afford to be too skimpy.<br/><br/>At the opposite end of the spectrum, the exemplars that immediately rise to mind are written by Vincent Baker: both Dogs In The Vineyard and, even more so, In A Wicked Age, provide <i>all</i> that is required for a careful, thoughtful group of players to get engaged and play happily for a medium-term length of time, and they do so quickly, concisely, and accurately. In both cases, the examples illuminate, not describe. In both cases, the answers are in the text (almost, oddly, in the same way that wargame rules are: <i>the answers are in the text</i>), and where they don't, you know what's expected: it's either not mechanically relevant, or it's not a mechanical question.<br/><br/>If I had to pick one game out of my entire collection that I thought was <i>concise</i>, focussed, thematically rich, and elegantly self-contained, I think "In A Wicked Age" would probably win, hands down. But, by the same token, I think "In A Wicked Age" demands a careful and experienced play group, or at least a group moderated by a patient, careful, and experienced person who can lead others in the right directions when questions arise.<br/><br/>I see your game as not necessarily trying to address this precisely identical audience -- as a result, I think your game could definitely benefit from more richness in example and setting detail. But not too much more: the basic premise can, I think, be very elegantly packaged up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_280378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch" title="Will_Hindmarch"><img alt="Will_Hindmarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.wordstudio.net/coffee_ring-32px.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch">Will_Hindmarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280378/#Comment_280378" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-13T11:21:35+00:00" title="July 13, 2010 11:21AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am more and more convinced that RPGs are too long. As the guy who designed <i>Damnation City</i> for Vampire, I think I'm qualified to say. That book could've been a couple of books, or a few interlocked PDFs, and all would've been well. Ultimately, though, it depends on what you're selling. There's not a whole lot of fat in D&amp;D books these days, for example, yet they continue to be good-sized books.<br/><br/>A lot of games don't require big books, even though they get them. For every World of Darkness core book, there's a Lady Blackbird RPG to be had, I think. They each have their place. <br/><br/>For my money, I like shorter, punchier PDFs and quick-reading RPG books like <i>Fiasco</i> and <i>3:16</i> at the same time that I like a heftier tome like <i>Trail of Cthulhu</i>. Knowing how long to make your book (and how many books or PDFs it actually is) is part of the creative judgment call\u2014it's part of the art.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280381/#Comment_280381" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-13T11:26:17+00:00" title="July 13, 2010 11:26AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, it's a useless asshole answer but - <i>as long as it needs to be</i>.<br/><br/>Some games get by with 10 pages.

Then there should be a non-mechanical section about how to run the game such that everyone has a great time, which will be helpful for people like me, and is more fun to read in your spare time than dense background or the nitty-gritty rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_280409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280409/#Comment_280409" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-13T13:35:17+00:00" title="July 13, 2010  1:35PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 13, 2010 3:45PM by jenskot.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Less is more... used to be my vote!<br><br/>But I'm changing my vote. <br/><br/>Whatever is easiest for me to use in play is my answer!<br/><br/>Rules that are only a few pages but crunch everything in, are incomplete, lack examples, and require me to search online to find clarity... are less awesome. <br/><br/>I don't like large books that remind me of encyclopedias. But often large books don't have to be large at all... they are just using the wrong tools (usually for understandable reasons). I wish my D&amp;D 4E PHB was 100 pages long and those pages and pages of lists were simply decks of cards. If no one is playing a certain class, I can just leave that deck at home. Same with fiction. If a huge portion of a book is meant to be read once and never used again in play, separate it. <br/><br/>My favorite current book layout is slide:ology. It's almost 300 pages but could have probably been crunched down to way less than 100 pages! They went the opposite direction of what most people do. They broke down their content so that every page spread presents a single idea! They added incredible amounts of white space. Replaced text examples with graphical examples. And highlighted everything that is important. <br/><br/>It's three times larger than it needs to be but the book is incredibly easy to browse and reference.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280411/#Comment_280411" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-13T13:37:36+00:00" title="July 13, 2010  1:37PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mouse Guard is a good size.<br/>Apocalypse World is a good size.<br/><br/>but then, so is ghost/echo.<br/><br/>I think there's really no answer that is appropriate, here.

For me, an RPG is too long when I start jumping ahead in the text to see how the pieces fit together. It's not necessarily about book length, but about verbosity in the individual sections. Rules should explain themselves and then either make with clarifying examples or get on with the next mechanism. <br/><br/>More and more, of late, I want to get an RPG absorbed as quick as possible, up front, and then explore the permutations and the depth... in that order. I don't want to explore a languid explanation. I want the gist, somewhere, and then I want material that I can sink into once I have the core architecture of the game in mind\u2014and that includes the thrust of the setting.<br/><br/>But I still stand by my original statement that finding that length is a creative challenge. Too long has as much to do with the style and importance of information as it does with quantity. One writer's smattering of information on an evocative and provocative game world is another's trudge through rambling details. I'll read a lot more about a game world if it's putting me into the trenches than I will if it's a cold overview, but a cold overview can be vital for conveying the breadth of a setting first.<br/><br/>So some of it is about structuring the information, rather than outright length. Some books are meant to be dipped into, others pored over. Longer books have their place, but I've had something close to my fill of them, of late.<br/><br/>Is <i>Do</i> going to be digest-sized? That makes a big difference in the page count I'd recommend for it. As an example, I gobble up smaller games lately, but never got around to <i>7 Skies</i> because I found its size impressive but intimidating for the material. (Not proud of that, but there it is.)<br/><br/>That's not a much better answer, I know, but you got me thinking about this most of the day, since I've been trying to estimate the length of an upcoming RPG project of my own, at the same time. I'd like the book to feel meaty, but I'd also like it to be quick-to-grok while leaving the reader hungry for more. So that's my bias, lately.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280557/#Comment_280557" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-14T04:27:08+00:00" title="July 14, 2010  4:27AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Will makes a good point - one of the determiners of a person's feelings about book length is psychological, right?

It's much harder to answer than what length do I enjoy, for which the shorter the better (seriously, <i>Serial Homicide Unit</i> requires me to read one page before playing for my first time, and my experience tells me that that's the ideal length).<br><br>However, how long is too long? It's too long when I won't bother starting (<i>Dresden Files</i>). It's too long when I walk away from it while reading it (<i>Trail of Cthulhu</i>, <i>Houses of the Blooded</i> and D&amp;D 4), and it's too long when finishing it becomes a chore (<i>Burning Empires</i>). The problem I have is that those games are probably complicated enough to warrant their length. So is it that I don't like long texts?

Or, perhaps less likely, complicated games with short texts?</blockquote>\nYou know what, yes. <i>Amber</i> is a simple game with an incredibly long text (too long for me these days, it's a good thing I read it back when I believed that long texts were essential), and <i>Capes</i> is, in my opinion, an exceptionally complicated game with a short text (and <i>Capes</i> is a game I quite enjoy).<br/><br/>I'd like to get more in depth with <i>Amber</i>. I love all the walkthroughs, the examples of auctions, of conflicts, all that stuff. Obviously the rules themselves are important as well. The part that feels too long for me is the NPCs (of course this is also possibly because I wouldn't really want to play with them, so it feels like unnecessary fluff (as does the entire supplement, <i>Shadow Knight</i>)).<br/><br/>And, on the subject, there are games where I find there is way too much text. <i>Monsters and Other Childish Things</i>, in my opinion, needed fifteen pages for the rules, and then another two for the Interpersonal Conflict Generator. Seriously, I almost dropped that game once I got past the rules and discovered all that useless junk (obviously, just my opinion, some people probably loved that stuff, although I then wonder if those people would have appreciated the ICG). The game doesn't get ignored by me because I happened to leaf through it right before dumping it and happened on the IGC. However, had the book been one hundred pages instead of fifty, I probably would never have reached the IGC.<br/><br/>What we see in common with those is that I don't really dig on pages and pages of details that I may or may not use when I play (exposition). I think it's because I don't really want to read it myself, and I wouldn't want to use that kind of stuff unless everyone had read it. It also tends to be dull, just long poorly written and dry. Like a textbook on a subject that I don't care for at all. And the fiction, the fiction in games is usually terrible, so all those pages of fiction make me want to throw the game away.<br/><br/>When I encounter those aspects, I end up feeling that the book is too long.<br/><br/>Except, and here's my only counter-example that I can remember, <i>Brave New World</i> and all of it's supplements. The rules were silly simple, and there over half of each book was dedicated to some kind of cross between fiction and exposition, and I loved it. Never played it, but I think I've read every book in the line.<br/><br/>Reading this over, I'm not sure how helpful this all is. It feels very subjective.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_280739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch" title="Will_Hindmarch"><img alt="Will_Hindmarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.wordstudio.net/coffee_ring-32px.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch">Will_Hindmarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280739/#Comment_280739" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-14T17:27:04+00:00" title="July 14, 2010  5:27PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 14, 2010 5:30PM by Will_Hindmarch.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The question is subjective.<br/><br/>The alternative to subjectivity is to say this: 239 8.5x11" pages. That's the upper limit of an RPG book's acceptable length and anything longer than that is in error. Also, an RPG should be no shorter than 42 pages. Lady Blackbird is in violation and John Harper has been fined. <br/><br/>Which is my assholic way of saying that the right length depends on the material and the creative intentions of the designer. Sometimes you want a text in which your reader can get happily lost, as Stephen King says. But sometimes you want rules that seem to inject themselves straight into the head, as if you'd swallowed a pill. There is no formula.<br/><br/>So subjectivity is fine. Only by comparing our subjective answers against the needs of a specific project can we begin to answer this question. The question, I think, is whether Daniel wants <i>Do</i> to cut like a knife or billow around the reader like a fog. Does he want the book to invite the reader in and hold him rapt from beginning to end, like a novel, or does he want the book to electrify the reader into putting down the book and making notes for play, before she's even finished reading? <br/><br/>An RPG book is too long when it becomes a slog, and a bad book can be a slog in one page.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280749/#Comment_280749" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-14T20:02:39+00:00" title="July 14, 2010  8:02PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My general rule of thumb is this - there's no such thing as an RPG book that's too long, but anything longer than about 50 pages should start out with a long section of instructions called "How To Read This Book," in which the stuff that begins on p.51 is described as "Strictly optional, but worth reading if...".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_280759">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280759/#Comment_280759" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-14T21:21:07+00:00" title="July 14, 2010  9:21PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to differ from the other people here. The maximum page count of your book should be determined by the type and quality of its binding and paper. Game books are reference books, so they need to be opened again and again without falling apart.<br/><br/>As for amount of material. If you can give me 200+ pages of material I'll use when playing, I'm a happy guy, even if I have to pay more for a bigger book. If you give me 100 pages of material and 100 pages of filler or poor editing, I'm not so happy. If you give me 100 pages of material and I feel I need 200 to really get the game bouncing, I'm downright cantankerous. Give me lots of stuff with which to make the game fun. After all, if I'm buying your game, I want your ideas.<br/><br/>Looking over my shelf, every rpg I've loved playing again and again over the years has a core rulebook in the 200+ page range. Add in sourcebooks and some of them get into the thousands of pages. Reading all that wasn't a slog, it was a joy that made me want to play more. And I did.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280959/#Comment_280959" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-15T14:33:42+00:00" title="July 15, 2010  2:33PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really want to thank everyone here for their thoughtful replies. Please continue the discussion if you find it fruitful as I have.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, I think I'm going to shoot for something like 64-80 pages That's about double the length of your average heavy box board game from Fantasy Flight Games, which I think is a reasonable comparison for my sort of story-building games. That's also about the length of a manga light novel.<br/><br/>Just about 2 pages will be devoted to what you might call "non-actionable setting." In other words, the very bare minimum to introduce the central premise of the setting for the game. You might consider flavor fiction "non-actionable setting."<br/><br/>About 10-20 will be devoted to "actionable setting," or parts of the background that are directly relevant in play. In <i>Do</i>, these are the letters people have written to the pilgrims asking for help and, in so doing, described a bit of their home world.<br/><br/>No more than 15-20 pages are the core rules, including character creation, storytelling, troublemaking and examples thereof. All formatted in a step-by-step procedure so as to avoid forward-referencing.<br/><br/>Another 15-20 pages will have advice. Stuff that comes up in play, but is best discussed after you've read the full procedure of play.<br/><br/>Any remaining pages will be as full and complete an example of play as can fit into the remaining book. Except for...<br/><br/>1-2 pages that synopsize the whole flow of play, with page refs for further info.<br/><br/>Seems like a nice reasonable goal for editing this stuff down, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281326/#Comment_281326" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-17T14:23:26+00:00" title="July 17, 2010  2:23PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it really depends on the game, and the era. Back when I was a teenager, the longer the page count the better - particularly if the cost per page went down with it. I didn't have much money so the more I could buy for my money the better it was, and I enjoyed reading lots. I also enjoyed long and involved character creation, taking several hours most of the time, and detailed rules for everything.<br/><br/>Now I like something short and quick that I can read in a single sitting of 90 minutes, character creation that comes in under 15 minutes and very few rules to work with - just enough to provide some sort of framework. I also like the books to be smaller - sized like Dragonlance 5th Age, Zorcerer of Zo, Burning Wheel, BESM 2E. <br/><br/>I'd say with 6"x9" page size, about 200 pages would be tops for me right now. Money is less of a concern, and time is more of a concern. Also, actually being able to play it with people means it should be playable out of the gate within 15-20 minutes, and the complexity should be such that I only have to read the book through once to get it.<br/><br/>Looking at the age target, I'd say longer is acceptable. At around 12 300-400 pages would have been fine for me, in fact even something of a matter of pride, and I would have loved to read every page meticulously, and still be wanting more. I think if you want parents to be playing it as well, you'd need it to be a lot shorter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB" title="PeterBB"><img alt="PeterBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB">PeterBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281338/#Comment_281338" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-17T15:21:54+00:00" title="July 17, 2010  3:21PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ccreitz</cite>Can anyone think of a game book that they thought was too short?</blockquote>\nLady Blackbird. I've tried to read it multiple times, and have never been able to finish it, because it's too damn short.<br/><br/>I mean this completely sincerely. I just popped it open and tried for a third or fourth time, same result. As far as I can tell, it has a rules "summary" without those rules being explained more fully anywhere else. Ok, so I guess "summary" means "all you're going to get"? So I try to read the rules summary, but it's written so concisely that it's a chore to puzzle out how it actually works. Would it kill you to devote a page to an example and/or a more prosaic explanation?<br/><br/>I'll happily read Houses of the Blooded, because it's interesting and tells me what I need to know (and then some). Reading is easy, I read things for fun. When a text is too concise, like Lady Blackbird, I'm no longer reading, I'm translating. Translating is not fun.<br/><br/>Too long is therefore better than too short. I can skim or even skip sections I don't care about if it's too long. I can't cause explanations and examples to appear out of thin air if they aren't there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281348/#Comment_281348" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-17T16:25:53+00:00" title="July 17, 2010  4:25PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: PeterBB</cite>I'll happily read Houses of the Blooded, because it's interesting and tells me what I need to know (and then some). </blockquote>\nFunny, because I found that it told me almost nothing I wanted for setting up intrigue and backstabbing story. At times I felt the game even undermined intrigue. I guess I build story very differently.<br/><br/>Back to topic. The proportions suggested for the game being discussed in the thread seem pretty reasonable. Certainly I think a game should be able to be presented in a brief way, I just prefer a bigger toolbox (5-10 times bigger) to be available when I need it.
