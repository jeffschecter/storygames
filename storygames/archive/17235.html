Sure, there are some neat oracle-style tables there to make suggestions, but it all comes down to the players to decribe the level of technology and how it gets used in their shared world. Since all the tech is colour, players can freely narrate their cyber-eyes, tactile holographic interfaces and Harley-Davidson Orbital Insertion Capsules to their hearts' content.<br/><br/>Second, you <i>have</i> to weave multiple story threads together. Every character and every faction has its own agenda, with a clear win condition created by the mechanics, so all the time, in every scene, someone is pushing to achieve something. As all these elements bump up against each other, you can't help but produce a rich, deep narrative.<br/><br/>Third, the hotseat GMing. When it's your turn, you don't play your character (OK, you can, but the scene won't really be about them), you pick on someone else's! Choose the storyline that interests you most or the one where you have a great idea for what happens next or the one that's had no action for a while; frame a scene for the character most involved in that story, putting an obstacle in their way, then see how they get over it.<br/><br/>Fourth, the freedom and power the above gives you. Want to drop a new character into things? BOOM! Done. Realised which faction might really be behind things? Play a scene and reveal their nefarious plans. Love two of the characters and want them to cross paths? Then do it!<br/><br/>Fifth, everything else about the game. The simple stats, the conditions that get traded about as game currency, the reward system, etc. It's all tightly woven together within the pages of a suprisingly compact little book, but gives you vast amounts of potential to play with.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391040/#Comment_391040" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-21T14:05:27+00:00" title="September 21, 2012  2:05PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I tried Remember Tomorrow once.  The multiple intertwining plots are gibsonian but also a nightmare to keep track of, which is why I doubt I will ever try to promote it again to my group. The mechanics felt quite gamey and abstract, and curiously devoid of cyberpunk trappings, but I feel like I didn't give them a good enough chance. For a 50-page game it's jam-packed with rules and looks great to boot.<br/><br/>Technoir always felt oddly lifeless to me when reading it. I didn't feel like cyberpunk themes were really addressed, but I haven't really tried the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391041/#Comment_391041" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-21T14:20:54+00:00" title="September 21, 2012  2:20PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like Technoir.

In fact, Snow Crash (as I remember it) was pretty much "people doing small but awesome things while a meta-narrative with plot twists is being revealed around them", which sounds very trad Cyberpunk 2020 to me. If you want to put the meta-narrative and plot twists in the hands of the players, then maybe Shock:. Remember Tomorrow I can't comment on, but by the sounds of it, it seems like it'd be a good fit, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan" title="Jonathan"><img alt="Jonathan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan">Jonathan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391076/#Comment_391076" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-22T07:06:22+00:00" title="September 22, 2012  7:06AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Metropole Luxury Coffin is a free one that you can check out that is similar to that Snow Crash feel.

I agree with most of what's been said above: TechNoir is more about the Noir than the Tech, but I like that about it. Remember Tormorrow allows for lots of gonzo and player input, but the lists in the book really are just lists of names, and whatever import or distinction they have comes entirely from the players.

RT is very narrative based, so having players that are skilled at narrative based games (Fiasco at least, Polaris at best) is better. My players had an awful time trying to narrate events off the cuff, because that's just not their style. Technoir created a better framework and set of rules for players, while still allowing for player agency (control over characters) and cool GM stuff (the Transmissions allow for an exploding plot that just keeps growing with minimal work).<br/><br/>Good luck with Remember Tomorrow and let us know how it goes!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
