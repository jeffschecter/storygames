There's just something compelling about them. (I even collect them - Everway, Misery Bubblegum, Once Upon A Time, Torg - and just got Saga: Dragonlance the other day) <br/><br/>So, little survey: if I made a storytelling game with fewer cards, who would be willing to print out and cut up ~40 cards?  Or take ~40 index cards and write a couple sentences on each? In order to playtest a 1-2 hour introductory improv-storytelling game?  "Like <i>Once Upon A Time</i> but 'good' (and setting-agnostic)" is what I'm shooting for.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362711/#Comment_362711" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-26T12:01:18+00:00" title="February 26, 2012 12:01PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How about this: Check out the Print-and-Play version of the game YOMI. <br/><br/>Plastic sleeves for CCGs cost about $5 for 100 on eBay or other online places.<br/>Most folks have old CCG cards laying around, and if they don't you can get a pile of cheap Lands or whatever on ebay for like a buck for a million.<br/><br/>So make a PDF version of "That's Drama" that is CCG card-or-less in size (less is fine, see next)<br/><br/>Folks can then print them out, cut them up and stick them in CCG-card-backed-sleeves. If there's a lot of cards (how many does the original set have?) people can have their friends come over with scissors, spend five minutes cutting/sleeving cards together, then play. <br/><br/>That method is extremely cheap, most gamers already have the resources needed to do this (or, like me, just need to buy a few packs of sleeves from eBay or <a href="http://www.coolstuffinc.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.coolstuffinc.com</a> ), win-win. I'd even suggest going this route with the "final product".<br/><br/>Anyway, if you do that (and I'd be interested in the original set, not necessarily a cut-down version), I'd give it a shot.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/doho123" title="doho123"><img alt="doho123" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/doho123">doho123</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362767/#Comment_362767" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-26T14:49:09+00:00" title="February 26, 2012  2:49PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's actually a pretty big group of print-and-play devotees on boardgamegeek in the forums.

For playtesting, you just play with a standard deck of playing cards, and you look up each entry in an oracle list. The game divides the deck into seasons, and for each season(/suit) you have a list of the 13 cards and what they mean.<br/><br/><b>Vulture City</b><br/>I've created print &amp; play cards. For my own set, I printed them, and put them in sleeves (using junk magic cards in the sleeves, behind the paper slips, for added stiffness). When I send others the playtest copy, it'll be print &amp; play style too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362777/#Comment_362777" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-26T16:38:16+00:00" title="February 26, 2012  4:38PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>How about this: Check out the Print-and-Play version of the game YOMI.</blockquote>\n[threadjack]Holy crap, this is AWESOME.<br/>I totally wanna make these guys in some other Anime RPG form (Wushu?), and play a hybrid RPG/CCG all about their adventures in the Tournament, sort of like the Mortal Kombat film, with any non-sanctioned combat (and indeed, any non-combat skill resolution) using the RPG's rules, and swapping to this for the Tournament bouts' results.

The other one uses custom cards and that's been a bit more of a challenge. There were a couple of kind souls who actually went to the trouble of printing out and assembling a deck on their end, although I have no idea how they went about it. I actually did something rather like Andy's suggestion when I constructed a deck for playtesting - although local game designer Philip duBarry gave me this handy link some time ago:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.boardgameinfo.com/content/316-PnP-Making-Cards" rel="nofollow">PnP - Making Cards</a> <br/><br/>I haven't tried it myself yet, but the results are impressive. FYI - I actually did have Gamecrafter whip up a prototype for me of my game and it turned out rather well. I think the cost was around $15 or so.<br/><br/><a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/photos/101741476056657498230/albums/5628703951255314209" rel="nofollow">Void and Steel Prototype</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
