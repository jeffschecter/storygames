It's a neotraditional game; a game master with a written adventure but with a lot of player influence.<br/><br/><i>Basic roll:</i> 2d10 against a value between 1-20. Equal or lower is a successful roll, and the Result of the outcome is the sum of the two dice. In combat, the Damage dealt is the Result of the roll.<br/><br/><i>Value to roll against:</i> a collected sum of one attribute, but multiple professions and items. It's up to the player to describe how they are important to the roll <i>after</i> the roll is made.<br/><br/><i>Modification:</i> Very hard (-10), Hard (-5), Challenging (\xb10), Easy (+5), Very easy (+10). A normal roll starts at Challenging but can be nudged up or down on the modification scale. A modification cannot go beyond \xb110. If it does, it's an automatic failure/success.<br/><br/><b>In the old version</b><br/>I really liked how magic worked in that game. A magician had a theme - illusions, fire, spirits - and could do whatever within that theme but had to roll against Magic when using it. The more complex the spell, the more Exhaustion it craved, but the roll reduced Exhaustion by the Result.<br/><br/>When casting a spell, the player choose between three <i>power ranks:</i> combat, manipulate, create. You could for example use fire in combat, to manipulate existing flames or create flames from nothing.<br/><br/>Higher power gave more Exhaustion, and the player could also increase the <i>range </i>or <i>duration </i>with additional increase of Exhaustion. From touch-&gt;sight-&gt;small area-&gt;large area, and immediate-&gt;scene-&gt;session-&gt;campaign.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455656/#Comment_455656" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-18T12:01:31+00:00" title="August 18, 2016 12:01PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 23, 2016 8:47AM by Rickard.">edited August 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>In the new version</b><br/>If anyone can recall, the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/455550/#Comment_455550" rel="nofollow">last post</a> talked about attributes and professions, with one attribute named <i>Bliss</i>. High Bliss means that the character is put to the world for a reason. Each character <i>gets two points of Fate each session</i>, that they can spend on increase values permanently or temporary increase the chance to roll high and succeed on a roll. If used as the latter they are collected into a pile up to the amount of Bliss. The Fate in that pile is given back to the player at the end of the session. If the player spend more Fate than Bliss, those points are lost forever.<br/><br/>The old system were clumsy in how it was put together. I didn't like Exhaustion because it was rarely used when magic wasn't involved. I still like the player choosing between the three power ranks, as well as range and duration, and having a theme was both a restriction and a source of inspiration.<br/><br/><i>One trouble with magic in all roleplaying games</i> is that it kind of replaces all other skills (in this game, "professions" have values just like skills). So in this game I will restrict magic by having the player spend Fate just to be able to use magic in the first place.<br/><br/>Changing power, duration and rank is changed to be handled as a modification to the value.<br/><br/>\n<table width="80%"><tr><td><b>Difficulty</b></td><td><b>Power</b></td><td><b>Range</b></td><td><b>Duration</b></td><td></td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>Easy (+5)</td><td>Combat</td><td>Touch</td><td>Immediate/Concentration</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Challenging (\xb10)</td><td>Manipulate</td><td>Sight</td><td>Scene</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Hard (-5)</td><td>Create</td><td>Small area</td><td>Session</td><td></td></tr></table>\n<br/>Remember that modification can only be \xb110 at most.<br/><br/>In the end, using magic could be an easy way out, but it will change your Fate.<br/><br/>[edit] Would possibly rename Combat into something more fitting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rgrassi" title="rgrassi"><img alt="rgrassi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rgrassi">rgrassi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455660/#Comment_455660" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-18T15:05:31+00:00" title="August 18, 2016  3:05PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Rickard">@Rickard</a><br/>Can you please guide us through a step-by-step example of the rules?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455661/#Comment_455661" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-18T16:32:27+00:00" title="August 18, 2016  4:32PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 18, 2016 4:35PM by Rickard.">edited August 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The gang is chased.

If a roll fail, the game master then responds with "No, because" and makes up why the character fails by providing a new situation. That situation can then be overcome with a new roll.
