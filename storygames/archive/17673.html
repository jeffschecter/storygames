I recently discovered this and am quite excited about it - it seems like a really concise way to agree how you will play an rpg game or campaign.<br/><br/>I've taken Chris's original version, combined it with some stuff from the Milton Keynes RPG club version, and <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/737926/Same%20Page%20Tool%20Rob%20A%20version.pdf" rel="nofollow">put it up here</a>.<br/><br/>Thanks to Shiru Kuro on rpg.net for the last question, which of course is crucial (but usually not asked). That thread is <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?665539-New-version-of-the-Same-Page-Tool" rel="nofollow">here</a>. <br/><br/>Have any of you used the SPT?

In my BW and Vampire games, where I'm GM, it's provoked some discussion. In my Pathfinder game, where I'm a player, it's at least provoked some confusion. The Pathfinder GM was quite surprised when I produced it - he'd never seen anything like that before.<br/><br/>We're still struggling to understand each other in Pathfinder - the problem is perhaps understanding the strength of my preferences (how extreme I am on the "must be player-driven" front). That's not something a sheet like this can get across, not if you've never heard of playing like that before.<br/><br/>Maybe the most important role of the SPT is to open up discussion - just being at the table, it reminds people that the way we play the game is a thing and can be negotiated.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400385/#Comment_400385" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-10T17:23:50+00:00" title="December 10, 2012  5:23PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree...there are some things that it leaves out or includes (unavoidably) misleadingly as equals - if there's one thing that's an absolute dealbreaker, it's hard to highlight it and say "look at this one thing" when there's so much to talk about. BUT it opens up discussion, which is cool. Identifying goals and ground rules up front saves so much trouble.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
