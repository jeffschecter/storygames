T&amp;T is Ken St. Andre's reimplementation of the idea of a role-playing game, after an evening spent perusing some variant of original D&amp;D and thinking "that doesn't make sense".  So while it superficially looks like old skool D&amp;D, at its heart it is really quite a different game.<br/><br/>T&amp;T rapidly iterated up v5 in the first couple years it was out, and then stayed at v5 since 1979.  I cannot speak to the versions before v5 since I have never played or looked at them.  My understanding was the two basic mechanisms (buckets of dice combat, and saving rolls) were in place since the beginning, but other systems (like missle combat and spellcasting) varied around that.<br/><br/>v5.0 is the most widespread version of the rules, and the version to which pretty much all published materials for the game were written (until very recently).  It's completely serviceable as written, although it does have an odd vestigial limb here and there.<br/><br/>v5.5 was the result of a reprint Flying Buffalo (the original publisher) did in early 2000, and simply included a couple pages of Ken's house rules (which had been previously promulgated by word of mouth/internet, and widely used) and a few other gegaws, unintegrated.<br/><br/>v7.0 was a hasty dump by Ken, with a brief bit of feedback from his Trollhalla maling list, of his ideas for a cleaned up version of the system, integrating the house rules of 5.5, cleaning up some of the old vestigial limbs, and tossing in a few new ideas.  It was triggered by Fiery Dragon's desire to publish the little metal box version of T&amp;T, in which they planned to include somebody else's redesign of T&amp;T, which bore little or no resemblance to Ken's T&amp;T.  In the end, the little box shipped with both rule sets, and, as far as I know, everybody pretty much ignores the non-Ken rules.<br/><br/>7.0 is in my opinion a very worthy cleanup, rationalization, and extension of the the system in 5.5.  It's main drawback is that due to the rushed writing, it is a bit disorganized and has weird errors in places, but it's quite usable.  It also features a few NEW vestigial limbs <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Finally, much like used to be the case with D&amp;D, nobody actually runs T&amp;T exactly as written in any version (not even Ken as far as I know <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/>  My own personal recipe is mostly 7.0, with an admixture of 5.0 (mostly the kindred chart and equipment lists) and my own house rules for those places I felt like 7.0 didn't go quite far enough.<br/><br/>...to be continued...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165451/#Comment_165451" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-26T15:59:15+00:00" title="August 26, 2008  3:59PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are several killer applications in T&amp;T. Some of my favourites:\n<ul><li>You get xp for ability checks (what would be skill checks in a never game) based on a simple formula, not GM fiat. Feel free to provoke lots of ability checks, but note that most of them are for the particular abilities that aren't that useful for combat (luck, say), and the consequences of failure can be drastic if you take stupid risks. But other than that, it's quite possible to make <i>more</i> xp from ability checking than combat.</li><li>The combat rules are just about the most realistic fit-in-a-nutshell system for fantasy skirmish that I've ever seen. I mean, the only reason this is not usually remarked upon is that the level of simplicity is such that you don't <i>expect</i> sensibility at that level. And regardless, you get it. The only other game that has the same sort of elegant inbuilt mojo going for it in the dicing department is The Mountain Witch.</li><li>I used to think that the campaign methodology of the game is superior to D&amp;D; after reading some early D&amp;D books really carefully I concluded that the books from AD&amp;D 2nd ed. on just completely lost all the sense D&amp;D had for actual play. Regardless, the T&amp;T campaign control structures are pretty unique, starting with the fact that there is no campaign - there is just a dungeon, set up and expanded by the GM as necessary. Also consider the explicit character stable, which provides its own level of strategy as you groom an efficient team of dungeon hackers and try to keep your point characters alive, while also gaining experience for them.</li><li>Character classes in T&amp;T are so rough and sketchy that there is actually a kind of fruitful void that springs up whenever you deviate from the core dungeoneering business - your character might be a "wizard" or "warrior", but that actually tells you <i>nothing</i> of your character's skill-set, background or nature. If a D&amp;D character is defined by the cliched features that traditionally attach to his character class, you can't really say that same of the two-and-half classes of T&amp;T; each character by necessity becomes an individual through play easier than in D&amp;D.</li></ul>\nAnd yeah, you'll want to fiddle the game to make sense for your own sensibilities, it's that sort of system. But in this case I'm absolutely comfortable with that, as the game <i>is</i> simple enough for it.<br/><br/>So yes, I like the game a lot, which is surprising, considering that T&amp;T is <i>also</i> full of the sort of zany old-school dungeoneering comedy that I don't want mixed up in my sword &amp; sorcery dungeoneering.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165453">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165453/#Comment_165453" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-26T16:09:18+00:00" title="August 26, 2008  4:09PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1. The Killer App:<br/><br/>T&amp;T is defined by two, almost completely unrelated mechanics:<br/><br/>a) The group oriented, bucket of dice regular combat system - regular, stand up and smack the other guy combat is resolved by having each character roll a varying number of d6s (typically based on weapon type) and adding a flat bonus to that based on weapon type and various characteristics.  Then each SIDE (not individual) adds up their results, and the winning side deals out damage according to the difference.  While conceptually simple, in practice it isn't a whole lot faster than old style D&amp;D combat, as the "onerollness" is offset by the need to roll and total a whole bunch of dice.<br/><br/>b) the saving roll system - in T&amp;T, a "Saving Roll" is not at all like the similarly named D&amp;D mechanic.  Rather it turns out to be a universal task/conflict/stunting mechanic, and an escape hatch from the standard combat system.  Describe some crazy thing you want to do, and the GM tells you which stat to use, and sets a target number.  Roll 2d6, add your stat, and try to meet or beat the target number.  Not so innovative these days, but remember T&amp;T did it first <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>But wait! There's more!  Every time you make a Saving Roll, you get experience, succeed or fail.  And the amount of experience you get GOES UP THE HIGHER YOUR TARGET NUMBER.  So you are rewarded for trying crazy stuff and failing (as long as you don't die).  And the GM is incentivized make things hard, but achievable.  This is cool.<br/><br/>Now T&amp;T 5.0 is like Sorcerer, or Riddle of Steel, in that the key cool ideas can all be found in the text, but very well hidden.  Saving Rolls were pretty much buried away on one page, and the key insight that YOU CAN USE THEM TO DO ANYTHING is a throwaway line in the middle of paragraph.  Fortunately 7.0 is a bit more explicit about the fact that SRs are actually the main show.<br/><br/>c) Okay, there are a few other handy things.  The fact that monsters are described by a single number (the Monster Rating), that tells you how many dice to roll for them in standard combat, and doubles as hit points.  If you want, you can add a little flavor by giving them a special effect or power, but that is pretty much it.  A library full of weird spells with fun names (Take That, You Fiend).  A generally gonzo attitude that keeps in mind that We Are Playing a Game Here and Having a Good Time.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>So that's my take on what T&amp;T is all about.  I've no doubt you could do all the same things with Red Box Hack, or PDQ, or even Forward! To Adventure (which is actually pretty cool and takes some of its inspiration from T&amp;T), but there is something about the quirkly wartiness of T&amp;T that keeps me coming back whenever I want some non-cerebral just play fun dungeon crawling action.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165456/#Comment_165456" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-26T16:12:51+00:00" title="August 26, 2008  4:12PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now I know!<br/><br/>Thanks, guys.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165457/#Comment_165457" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-26T16:17:41+00:00" title="August 26, 2008  4:17PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I love Monster Rating. Luv it. One score to rule them all, the small-and-quirky goblins, large bugbears and huge dragons. There's an inbuilt death spiral, too, as a monster's combat adds are based on it's Rating, which in turn is reduced by damage.<br/><br/>At first that combat system looks outright idiotic if you've been playing miniature skirmish rpgs for your whole life, but T&amp;T is actually the first genuinely description-based rpg combat system - you don't need the miniatures and the whole initiative-based combat scheme D&amp;D-derived games do. When you realize that the damage from a given round of fighting actually need not be distributed equally, but can instead be given out based on the tactical situation, the system actually hits an excellent sweet spot as a rpg combat system that works based on simple description of the action instead of careful positioning.<br/><br/>Man, I definitely need to get my paws on T&amp;T somehow before I go back north.

There are many more exotic choices as well, such as bagh nakh (steel tiger claws), bullovas and chakram (of <i>Xena</i> fame), all of which are presented via their native name and defined in a glossary. Besides offering color, the weapons list serves as the primary means of customizing starting characters; two dwarven warriors may be mostly indistinguishable, except one is wielding a bhuj and the other a francisca (both are types of a axes). Of course there's also a bit of a mini-game engendered by the weapon list, since only about six choices are optimal for starting characters (I don't think I ever made a T&amp;T character who didn't wield a dirk). In contrast, non-combat equipment barely rates a paragragh of mention and no definition.\n<blockquote>2.  What's the deal with the multiple editions?

Whereas D&amp;D modules of the time were striving for a psuedo-historical validity and added layers of tactical crunch, T&amp;T modules offered trolls who dressed like Chicago gangsters, wielded magically devastating switchblades and liked to ambush adventure parties by rolling an upright piano down the stairs at them. Besides a occasional wave of the hand about magic (which functions more like science-fantasy mutating radiation, apparently) there is absolutely no attempt to justify the wackiness of the T&amp;T world, its just presented at face value. And I should say "worlds", since there was no set-in-stone campaign setting. The book makes passing mention of the dragon continent "Phredd" that the original gang all ran their game in, but also points out that each referee formed their own version of it. Again in contrast to D&amp;D, it seems that it never occurred to St. Andre and the other writers that a setting was supposed to be rigid or predefined beyond the current needs of the GM. It is notable that, though the game was the second most popular rpg for a time*, and easily in the top ten for a few years after that, it never inflated the line with supplements or expansions beyond a string of adventures for the main book.<br/><i><br/>*this statement is a slight cheat, since T&amp;T was also only the second rpg published, so by default it couldn't have been lower than second place for a while.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165800/#Comment_165800" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-27T14:42:04+00:00" title="August 27, 2008  2:42PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>trolls who dressed like Chicago gangsters, wielded magically devastating switchblades and liked to ambush adventure parties by rolling an upright piano down the stairs at them.</i><br/><br/>Brilliant!

Since Fiery Dragon has stopped doing the metal tins, this set comes in a heavy cardboard box about the size of a fat trade paperback. (About the size of the Wandering Star Conan collections actually)  It's got a new cover painting, which I think is the best T&amp;T cover yet.  It contains numerous books, some ring bound and the thinner ones saddle stapled.  The main rule book has gone from 120 to 170 pages, with the additional content including the weapons glossaries and combat examples that were relegated to a CD in the previous box.  It claims to be better edited, which I'll take as a given since the 7.0 book was rather poor in that regard.  The 7.5 book does suffer from being printed on rather cheap paper.<br/><br/>Conspicuously absent is the "alternate" rules book that was included with 7.0.<br/><br/>Also included are the little Monsters &amp; Magic pamphlet included with the 7.0 rules, as well as two more spiral bound books, one containing more magic spells for levels 1-5 and the other containing lots of monsters.  These collections were put together with contributions from Trollhalla and other sources, and I believe are also sold separately by Outlaw Press (Codex Incantatem and Monstrum Codex).  There is also a pamphlet sized solo module, a pamphlet sized GM module, a fold out map of Trollworld aka The World of Kaball, and three sheets of punch out character &amp; monster tokens mounted on heavy stock.  And some photocopied character sheets.  And 4d6.<br/><br/>So you get alot for your money, and with the cleaned up rulebook, I'm thinking 7.5 is an excellent choice for someone interested in getting into T&amp;T.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/edheil" title="edheil"><img alt="edheil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/edheil">edheil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167150/#Comment_167150" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T20:50:18+00:00" title="September  4, 2008  8:50PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>In most older games, from Runequest to Arduin to Gamma World, there is a chapter or a book consisting of a long list of monsters, each with a variety of combat stats.</p>\n<p>In 5th edition T&amp;T (1979), you have the following paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>Having good guys without bad guys would be pretty dull stuff.  What lurks and slithers in your imagination I don't know, but in mine there are fire-breathing dragons, crocodiles, unicorns, snarks, sharks, and boojums, black hobbits, giant spiders, cave lions, pythons, centaurs, toothy non-flaming dragons, wyverns, wurms, griffins, hippogriffs, werewolves and vampires, balrogs, basilisks, ghosts, jubjub birds, slithy toves, cave bears, sphinx, enchanted warriors, zombies, reptile men, flame fiends, harpies, orcs, ogres, gremlins, goblins, trolls, giants, two-headed giants, three-headed giants, mushroom monsters, cockatrices, giant slugs, banshees, mummies, barrow-wights, living statues, shoggoths, wraiths, demons, leopards, octopi (giant economy size), gnoles, minotaurs, slime-mutants, drooling maniacs, half-orcs, hydrae, living skeletons, bandersnatchi, jabberwocks, pithecanthropi, ghouls, mad dogs, poisonous vipers, blood bats, night gaunts, lamiae, cannibals, witches, warlocks, rabid rats (ulsios), chimerae, hags, giant slimy worms, yeti, tigers, gorgons, bigfoots, invisible stalkers, were-creatures of all varieties, misanthropes and misogynists, manticores, and lots more.  If you want more, look through books of mythologies of ancient cultures, or books of science fiction and heroic fantasy.  In no time at all, you'll be inventing your own too.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Plus the rules for how Monster Ratings work, and a couple tables giving sample Monster Ratings for different dungeon levels, and examples of attribute multipliers for various monsters, in case you want to roll up monsters as if they were characters.</p>\n<p>Note: the aforementioned 3 tables do not have all the same monsters as in the above paragraph, nor does any of them contain the exact same list of monsters as the others -- and where the monsters on the two attribute tables do overlap, they often contradict each other, and where either of them overlaps with the Monster Rating chart, there is no obvious correspondence between the MRs and attribute multipliers.  So there is vehemently no Standard Correct List Of Monster Numbers.</p>\n<p>If you find that awesome, you are the target audience for T&amp;T.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167255/#Comment_167255" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-05T10:46:37+00:00" title="September  5, 2008 10:46AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 5, 2008 10:47AM by John_Powell.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=54407&amp;" rel="nofollow">RPGNow has free T&amp;T rules derived from v5 available for download.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
