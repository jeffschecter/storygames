<blockquote>"If you start with a gut-grabbing one-line idea, the thinking goes, there must be some way to translate its appeal into empathic terms (you can begin by asking why it grabs you); but if you start with a general empathic theme, say, the question 'What is duty?' it is well nigh impossible to deduce a priori a story like <i>The Bridge on the River Kwai.</i>"<br/></blockquote>
That's from Jon Boorstin's <a href="http://www.librarything.com/catalog/564523" rel="nofollow">The Hollywood Eye:  What Makes Movies Work</a>, page 162.<br/><br/>Now replace "a priori" with "from a game."  I'm not trying to make inflammatory statements, I'm honestly considering it:  does the sentence still hold true?  Is thematic roleplaying, story gaming, the missing step that's caused so many movies to get made backwards?                </div>

                            Hi Brendan,<br/><br/>The truth is that nothing catches fire until you have:<br/>- a concrete situation<br/>- that the people at the table care about.<br/><br/>Which is why, "Duty vs. Compassion" leads to empty navel gazing, while, "Your father orders you to kill your sister because she might be a dark sorcereress" leads to exciting play.<br/><br/>The problem for storygames is that we're growing out of a hobby that has not been based off of literary form, and lacked all of the actual tools, and also while making the shift, is just beginning to realize that evocative stuff doesn't "just happen", but requires both spin and effort.<br/><br/>Though the example I just gave above is functionally no different than a Kicker caught between two definitions of Humanity, two Spiritual Attributes, or a good set of BITs + Relationships, etc.  people need to see how the concept ties direct to the fiction element to really "get it".  We're also seeing games like Polaris, Falling Leaves, etc, where these kinds of situations are generated as a result of following the structure of play without having the players actually think about it at all, so I think we are seeing games get better at taking the concrete grabby and go the other way with it.                        </div>

<p>I'll add to what Chris said that, if you have a system that rewards you for playing to theme, then you don't have to (and perhaps shouldn't) create a concrete situation that has the theme already embedded in it.</p>
<p>If you make "Justice vs. Despair" your theme, and then say "Your father orders you to kill your sister because she might be a dark sorcereress" (love the spelling, BTW) it might seem to you that the players are going to make it be about Duty vs. Compassion <em>anyway</em>.</p>
<p>But if there's a reward, no matter how small, for twisting things to be about justice vs. despair, the players find a way.  Don't ask me how they do it, but they do.</p>

                            So, as I understand it, the Jon Boorstin quote suggests that it doesn't work well to start with a theme, and then come up with a concrete situation which illustrates that theme.  <br/><br/><b>TonyLB</b> wrote:
<blockquote>I'll add to what Chris said that, if you have a system that rewards you for playing to theme, then you don't have to (and perhaps shouldn't) create a concrete situation that has the theme already embedded in it.</blockquote>
Tony, so it sounds like you're disagreeing with Boorstin's principle in general.  Do you think there's anything to it at all?  <br/><br/>I don't know if it's true in general, but it resonates some with me.  When faced with a real character and situation, I can see lots of themes that they can play to.  However, when given a particular theme and asked to come up with characters and situation to illustrate it, I don't do so well.  I can do it, and it is interesting as a challenge.  However, the end results are not as strong or interesting to me as if I start with characters or situation.  <br/><br/>Perhaps different people simply prefer either approach.  Thinking about it, I do use a partial "choose a theme" in some more dramatic games.  This contrast seems a bit like the two approaches of creating monsters from my <a href="http://www.darkshire.net/~jhkim/rpg/buffy/adventuredesign.html" rel="nofollow"><b>Buffy Adventure Design</b></a> essay.  What I say there is: 
<blockquote>As for how to come up with such opponents, there are roughly two approaches:<br/><br/>1. Start with monster, then come up with issue(s).<br/>2. Start with issue(s), come up with monster.<br/><br/>The advantage of the former is that the monster (or other opponent) is usually more familiar and symbolically rich. The disadvantage is that the issue might not work so well for the players. The advantage of the latter is synchronicity with characters and their subplots. The disadvantage is the creatures tends to be a generic ugly demon which may not be compelling.</blockquote>
Anyhow, I'm curious about what other people see as trade-offs here.                        </div>

                            I honestly think it has a lot to do with how your brain works when constructing meaning. I've little to no problem in coming up with characters then finding theme, or finding theme and then coming up with characters. <br/><br/>OTOH, several of the folks I play with are really good at doing one but not the other. I have a player who, whenever we start with theme, will become almost unable to come up with a good character -- she tries to play to specifically with the theme in a direct manner and isn't good at coming up with situations based upon it. But have her start with situation and you'll find that getting theme from it is very easy. <br/><br/>This player is good at coming up with characters that have strong conflicts. She has a strong sense of how people interact and all the things that go wrong in those interactions. She feels her way through the process, and focuses on what the situation is like to be in at the moment. (Yes, she's also an immersionist and an FFF on the MB type.) <br/><br/>The problem with this is that when you are putting together a campaign it can be difficult to get a union of theme with players of this type. She'll come up with a theme alright, but because she moves through it on her own and by her gut, it can be difficult to integrate her theme with the themes that everyone else came up with. Reward systems like Tony's, good play with some central ideals by the GM, and creative interpretation can all help with these -- but the fact that the issues came together from disperate sources rather than being created together is still often obvious. (To me, I'm picky.) <br/><br/>Now, this players SO is the exact opposite: ask for a situation from which to get theme and you'll get the flatest, most boring situations you ever dreamed of. But start with theme, and you will eventually get Bridge on the River Kwai. With him it's easy to start off with a unified theme for the whole game, because he will construct his parts right out of the ideas you gave him. He is very good at logically breaking down play components and building character to plot (almost to the point of sardoodledum). In system's like those Tony talks about he tends to dominate, because twisting things this way and that by the power of his thinky-brain is what he loves. (He's non-immersive and a TTT MB type.) Problem is that his characters often lack that "personal investment" element that is needed to really make a game punch you in the gut. He's so specifically crafted situation for the theme that the part he almost always leaves out is the "my personal emotional response" part. <br/><br/>Working with both of them in the same game has required me to start building up campaigns in waves and layers. One sit down to hammer out ideas is usually not enough. Mailing lists, wikis, and multiple talks over dinners are all needed for people to work in and out and on and off of each others ideas. The thinkers need a chance to generalize and focus, the feelers need time to take that and compare it to their personal gut instincts, and so on. So we often start with general talks, narrow in on theme in a very broad way, then create preliminary ideas for characters, then talk about those characters and their issues, then back to theme and PC creation, and then on to actually setting up the game. It takes time, and its not always easy to negotiate, but the results are usually pretty damn solid.                        </div>

<p>I'm disagreeing?  I didn't realize.  His principle looks good to me, as regards <strong>prep-work</strong>.</p>
<p>If you tell me "Your father has ordered you to kill your sister lest she become a dark sorcereress" and then ask me "What's the theme here?" then I'll probably go with "Duty vs. Love" or "Fear vs. Compassion" or something obvious.  And I'll do it <em>really</em> quickly.  It's easy.</p>
<p>If you tell me "Make up a story that's about Duty vs. Love" then it will be <em>much harder</em> ... possibly harder than I can do.  So yeah, on that count I think I agree with Boorstin.</p>
<p>But what I'm saying, beyond that, is that if you tell me "Your situation is that you're in a fleet of starships transporting the last of your race, and you're fleeing from a dark and mysterious foe," <strong>and then</strong> you tell me "Make up a story, given that situation, that's about Hope vs. Love," then I can do it far more easily than if you hadn't given me the "constraint" of the situation in the first place.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>

                            Fred and Yoki:  I absolutely agree (I've written <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.xorph.com/anacrusis/" rel="nofollow">a few constrained stories</a>).<br/>
<br/>
Boorstin says "we come up with a situation and a story, then try to pull out a theme--because it's harder to come up with a theme, then pull out a situation and a story."   What this discussion is making clear is that Boorstin conflates situation and story, but they can be pulled apart and rearranged to give a more productive ordering.  Story games say "we come up with a situation, come up with a theme, and pull out a story."<br/>

My goal in posing the question was to determine whether thematic gaming has uncovered something he missed, and I think the answer is yes.                        </div>

<p>w00t, I say.  w00t.</p>
<p>Yep, I think that's the nut of it.  I agree, and I think it's important to note.</p>

I think it's interesting to look at different approaches.  For example, Dogs in the Vineyard is quite different from Primetime Adventures.  In PTA, you've got an explicit Issue for each PC, and you know what the focus is going to be based on Screen Presence for that episode.  Dogs, on the other hand, is quite different.  You've got a situation with a bunch of characters and what they want.  The book tells you to <i>not</i> play the story, but to instead play the NPCs by figuring out what they want.  <br><br>I'm sure there are other variations as well.  Polaris seems similar to Dogs to me.  You've got traits and characters and then go from there.  I haven't played Capes yet -- any thoughts on it?                        </br></br></div>

                            Dogs tells <em>the GM</em> not to play the story, but to play the town -- the story is an emergent property of the situation in motion.<br><br/>Capes takes a very different tack where the situation is an emergent property of play, and story is an emergent property of the situation being created and manipulated through play.<br/><br/>I'm currently all aboggle with the distinction, too, as I'm finishing up FLFS, which has explicit situation creation and the story comes out of the situation, and I'm starting in on Agora, where the situation is part of the story as it arises from play.  It's an interesting difference.                        </br></div>
