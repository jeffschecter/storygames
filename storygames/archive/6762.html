Still, NLG is capable of a lot, if by 'a lot' we mean the NL expression of information according to carefully detailed rules and pre-written natural phrases.<br/><br/>For the purposes of story generation, this means that the computer program does not invent or "make up" the events that happen in the story -- the individual events are pre-written by the human designer. Nor does the program invent phrases to express these events -- those phrases are also pre-written by the designer. The program's job is simply to take these elements, the events and the phrases, and automatically combine them in a way that's presentable -- according to rules defined by none other than, yes, the designer.<br/><br/>So, as you would expect, automatic story generation does not make things easier for the human designer -- this you'll see firsthand if you decide to experiment with it. But once the system is in place, the program can automatically generate thousands of unique stories, by combining pre-defined elements in various ways.</blockquote>\nThe site includes a <a href="http://www.infinity-universe.com/Infinity/Downloads/DescrEditor2.zip" rel="nofollow">link</a> to download a copy of their prototype, a backstory generator of sorts. It looks interesting, but for some damn reason the app doesn't work on my PC. Screenshots and the docs look promising, though, so take a look. <br/><br/>What's primarily interesting is how they've structured the declarative language used to create the story generator. Instead of a purely static chronologically-based system, they've done it in a way that looks really interesting, but quite a bit to take in -- I've only skimmed the initial post explaining the algorithm, so I'm not exactly clear how it works just yet, and how it differs from previous random generators I've seen in S-G.<br/><br/>But, in any case, go take a look. It's not a S-G, but I'll bet there's plenty good ideas to <del>shamelessly appropriate</del> be inspired from.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150350/#Comment_150350" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T04:31:15+00:00" title="June 13, 2008  4:31AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran a few attempts; I'm not seeing much besides what Abulafia does, except that the randomly generated elements don't break up the rest of the text.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
