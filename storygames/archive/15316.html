The indie games section covers Evil Hat, Catalyst, and Cubicle... so it's not really about indie games all that much, which is strange.  So, we're in there, just hard to find in the awkward organization.  I initially thought there was nothing on indie games at all, which is easy to do, the way the book is subdivided. Thankfuly, that's not the case. I've been meaning to post some thoughts on how indie games are discussed, but just haven't gotten around to it yet.<br/><br/>I haven't read the whole book yet because it is massive: 450 pages, double-column 8.5x11.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347847/#Comment_347847" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-04T08:10:40+00:00" title="November  4, 2011  8:10AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            P.S. I'm also writing a history of indie games for the <i>Magic Missile</i> anthology I'm putting together, so obviously I have some strong opinions about how to portray this stuff.  Shannon picks up on some important points (like the connections to Costikyan, Stafford, Tweet, Laws, and Wallis; the Forge Booth) but misses some others (the critical importance of the internet + direct-to-customer distro, the heightened role of women in indie games, the building of personal connections through playing and supporting each others' games, no mention of Vincent aside from a brief note on Dogs, would have been great to include sales numbers since most indie folks publicly release those, no real attempt to talk about trends in design and play, the rise of local indie games meetups, Jiffycon / Go Play, etc.).  So, overall, a major step forward and it's great to have an outsider's perspective on how this history looks, but there's still room for an more in-depth look bringing in more insights from folks who were directly involved.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347855/#Comment_347855" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-04T09:51:02+00:00" title="November  4, 2011  9:51AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The problem, I'm thinking, is the focus on <i>companies</i>.

And, well, me making my $5 game and selling it online is industry, but Shannon's focus (from looking at the ToC) is pretty high-up; he pretty much mostly cares about companies, as Paul said.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347871/#Comment_347871" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-04T12:24:36+00:00" title="November  4, 2011 12:24PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 4, 2011 12:24PM by J_Walton.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Paul:</b> Exactly, I said the same thing in my initial response to the book.  Sales-wise, Vincent Baker is a medium-sized RPG company, but he's also just some dude.  And since it's all direct sales, it doesn't show up on any industry spreadsheets.  Likewise, MLwM is never going to show up on anybody's industry figures (it's never even been on IPR) and neither are the dozens of games that have been directly influenced by it (like, most RPGs with an endgame).  So, only part of the picture, definitely.<br/><br/>It would also be interesting to know what indie RPG sales+play+awards look like as an aggregate, not as individual publications, because that's where our influence truly is. One dude putting a free PDF up on the internet may not seem like much, but it's much more significant when considered in the context of everything else that's going on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347875/#Comment_347875" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-04T13:19:13+00:00" title="November  4, 2011  1:19PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 4, 2011 2:26PM by lumpley.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just gotta jump in to say no!
