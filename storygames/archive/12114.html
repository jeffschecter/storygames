GNS is approaching its tenth birthday.  It's been well over four years since Ron <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNS_Theory#History" rel="nofollow">pointed out</a> that GNS is to be considered harmful.  It's been almost as long since Mike and Josh started saying that we should damn well stop talking about it and <a href="http://go-play.org/?p=4" rel="nofollow">go play</a>.  There's a thread on the front page of this site <i>right now</i> that points to <a href="http://mightyatom.blogspot.com/2010/05/game-theory-101.html" rel="nofollow">a list of games</a> you should <i>actually play</i> if you want to learn about theory.<br/><br/>That little acronym has done way more to divide, discourage and frustrate people than it ever did to generate fun or interesting games.  Typing out those three letters is, at this point, equivalent to trolling.  I know Andy's already stepped in to make this point in Fred's original thread, but--as bad ideas do--it's spawning fast.  Eero and Zac, you guys should know better.<br/><br/>So here's a promise:  if you and I can agree to stop starting threads and posts about GNS, commenting on them, or taking their bait in any other way, I will pay you a dollar next time we meet.  I will even hug you, if you so choose.  I GUARANTEE that is more worth and more friendship than you will ever get out of another goddamn theoretical, play-free forum wank-off.<br/><br/>Go play, go play, go play.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271227/#Comment_271227" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-14T16:36:58+00:00" title="May 14, 2010  4:36PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Amen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_271229">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271229/#Comment_271229" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-14T16:38:47+00:00" title="May 14, 2010  4:38PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Anti-intellectualism is never a good thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271230/#Comment_271230" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-14T16:41:38+00:00" title="May 14, 2010  4:41PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you need another reason to cut it out, <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4" rel="nofollow">here are the rules for posting here</a>, where theory discussion not predicated on praxis is explicitly called out as unwelcome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_271232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan" title="Brendan"><img alt="Brendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.xorph.com/images/miniludie.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan">Brendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271232/#Comment_271232" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-14T16:45:01+00:00" title="May 14, 2010  4:45PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, come on, Jeff.

Also, having a bit of practice talking about these sorts of theoretical matters is enormously helpful as a recruitment tool. If you meet a bright person with a good imagination to whom it has never even occurred to take RPGs and their kin seriously as art, shouting "Go play!" at them while jumping up and down is going to make you look like...well, what you are, I suppose.

I really hope we all know by now that it's possible to make things that address people's creative agendas in an incredible variety of interesting ways.  If you don't believe that,<i>go play.</i>If you want your creative agenda addressed,<i>go play.</i>If you've tried that and it's not quite what you want yet,<i>go design.</i>But rumination on whether non-immersive simulationism encompasses the subversion of genre tropes produces nothing of value.</blockquote>\nSee, this is the bit that gets me. 'That part of the revolution is done.'  What?  Are you really saying that GNS and the Big Model actually created - definitively and for all time - a model for the process of engaging in collaborative storytelling?  Really?  Because that's a really big statement, considering (and I actually haven't read this for myself) that the originator of the model declared it 'harmful', and there are real, serious questions about the validity of the model to begin with?<br/><br/>As it happened, I published the first draft of my own AGE Model <a href="http://www.kumapageworks.org/PDFs/AGE_Model_1.1.pdf" rel="nofollow">(hey - a LINK)</a> when the Forge decided it had moved past theory and wouldn't be talking about it anymore - and I got this exact feeling back then: that there was this idea that the whole theory thing had been decided and it was pointless to talk about it anymore, and that there was some sort of 'graduation' from theory now that we've figured out the world is round and everyone can go play happily ever after.<br/><br/>It's BS.  GNS exposed, as far as I can tell, one solid mode of play (narrative play), and everything that's come from it has been in that vein - and the things in that vein (like Mr. Czege's games) are exceptional examples of that one mode.  But who knows how many other modes of storytelling there are, or if (shock!) narrative game construction could actually be improved if the model for examining what goes on at the table were improved, revised, or even completely altered.<br/><br/>My crack about Einstein was just that: Up until 1906, everyone pretty much accepted Newton as the end-all of physics.  The fact that Newtonian physics is perfectly acceptable for putting a man on the moon doesn't change the fact that relativity is pretty much as (if not more) important than the Newtonian flavor.<br/><br/>I also agree that there's a lot of wankery out there (or at least was when I last checked) - but painting all theory discussion with the same wank is completely unfair.<br/><br/>The craft of game design demands play - no doubt about it.  But it also sorely needs a theoretical underpinning as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_271257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271257/#Comment_271257" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-14T17:26:58+00:00" title="May 14, 2010  5:26PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I pretty much agree with you. I do think the theory of creative agendas needs to be a part of public conversation, so folks find it if they need it. Here's my testimony:<br/><br/>1. I needed GNS to help me start thinking about why I was bitter and lapsed. Conversations with Ron were also instrumental.<br/>2. And then I needed a gamer ally to help me pursue a different play paradigm. This for me turned out to be my friend Tom. I needed GNS for this too. Ultimately, I ran The Pool and he ran Theatrix. But we needed to explore goals and possibilities and generate excitement and creative momentum via conversation first.<br/>3.

It's not just restricted to pen-and-paper / tabletop roleplaying either.</blockquote>\nIt should be noted that there's no bright shining line between "university-level research and discussion of roleplaying" and gamer-level discussion. As Hitchens and Drachen note in their IJRP article, "Some researchers participate in both the academic and the players' discourse on RPG theory." Of course, Hitchens and Drachen also say that the RPG community's self-reflective introspection "lacks connections to wider game [studies] theory." <br/><br/>But I'd argue that Hitchens and Drachen would benefit from a stronger familiarity with the "players' discourse" on RPGs. For example, they talk about the "presence of a game master" as an important distinguishing characteristic of RPGs. And that's true enough as far as it goes, but the conflation of social role (game master) with game function (the game-level tasks typically associated with a game master) means that their discussion of what RPGs are has the potential to lead us astray. "Oh, no GM--can't be a role-playing game. Sorry, <i>Polaris</i>; better luck next time, <i>Shab-al-Hiri Roach</i>. Where the fuck are you going, <i>Universalis</i>?" Their definition can of course be saved by recognizing the existence of GM-functions distinct from and distributable among the players at the table. But that would require a <i>more sophisticated understanding</i> of RPGs, one that's frankly only available at, say, the Forge. Or here.<br/><br/>Now, none of that is GNS, of course, but even there I think Hitchens and Drachen might have an easier time distinguishing RPGs from other game-forms by acknowledging the kinds of experiential rewards that are collectively produced in RPG play, which ultimately is what I think GNS gives you.<br/><br/>But my point is that to defer to academic game studies as somehow automatically more sophisticated than our own conversations is to give academia too much credit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_271360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271360/#Comment_271360" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-15T06:21:08+00:00" title="May 15, 2010  6:21AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 15, 2010 6:36AM by Todd_L.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It's 2010.

Really, that's where it is.<a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?board=14.0" rel="nofollow">here's a link</a>. You just have to frame it with your actual game play.</blockquote>\nThere is any other <b>fruitful</b> way to talk about theory?<br/><br/>I really don't get people who say that discussions about theory "stopped" at the Forge. All that what said was "stop trying to impress people with big words. Tie your theory talk and question to actual play, concrete examples"<br/><br/>Story Games really is not the place for theory discussions. There is no "actual play" culture (it's really, really different from "go play". The latter assume that you can't play and talk theory at the same time, and it's used usually as "shut up and go away". The people who can't talk theory with actual play examples are I think the source of this confusion). There are too many forge-haters or people that are playing a character when they post and are trying to score Xps or get fan mail. Every thread about theory here gets derailed or smothered or become a podium for somebody's ego. <br/><br/>So, I would urge people interested in gaming theory not only to read/post in The Forge, but to disregard EVERYTHING they read about forge theory outside of the Forge. There is really no "quality checking" about what you will get as answers, and 9 times out of ten it will be factually wrong, misleading or even a lot of rubbish.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_271460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271460/#Comment_271460" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-15T17:05:05+00:00" title="May 15, 2010  5:05PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I got a lot out of GNS when it first came up.  It really opened my eyes to how system maps to certain types of in-game behavior, and I still find it useful when introducing new kinds of RP systems to fellow gamers who haven't played anything other than d20 or Storyteller.  More fruitful for me ultimately are the elements of Creative Agenda, Social Contract, Stances, etc. that fall into a more praxis-oriented taxonomy.<br/><br/>That said, I don't give a damn who talks about GNS.  The biggest problem with it, in my view, is that it's become Grade-A flame bait.  For every thread where the topic comes up, someone somewhere seems to think a kitten died.<br/><br/>Those who find discussion about it useful and fun may do so all day long without pissing a drop into my Cheerios.  I'm baffled by the notion GNS is harmful.  It's unlikely to be interesting to me unless mapped to actual play, but I don't begrudge anyone their pure theory talks, or belittle them for going there.  There are plenty of threads here I choose not to read because the topic or direction doesn't grab me.  Big fuckin' deal.<br/><br/>Are we talking about a rule or rule-of-thumb that discussion of certain brands of theory here isn't acceptable?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

I don't really remember seeing similar reactions and cries of useless theoretizing when stuff like immersion gets discussed, for example. For me something like GNS is miles closer to practical application than the immersion myth ever was, so I can't say that I really understand this arrangement of theory vs. actual play. Seems to be more like GNS vs. topics I like.<br/><br/>That being said, I don't have any particular passion for theory <i>discussion</i> myself anyway, so if it's really bothering somebody I'll be more than happy to keep quiet about my wrong opinions. Theory works better for me in essay form where it's more separated from individuals and specific points of contention.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271465/#Comment_271465" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-15T17:58:58+00:00" title="May 15, 2010  5:58PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 15, 2010 6:00PM by noclue.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, I basically agree with Brendan.

There's this gamer inside me that likes to roll dice and win and calculate shit on charts to figure out the whether I've wounded the evil overlord or nailed my mother's ankle to the floor. And there's other guy inside me that loves to see characters engaged in meaty conflicts and experience the juicy fiction that evolves at the table from all this juiciness and to have that fiction build to a crescendo of awesomeness and gravitas. And there's this other dude, he likes verisimilitude and for things to make sense and to be able to occupy this imagined dimension where things hold together and produce seamless experience that stays true to a particular genre, or models the fucking actual real world, or some other space that we come together to create. And each of these guys may be talking more loudly or less loudly depending on the game I'm playing or the mood I'm in...<br/><br/>But, I need a language to talk about this menagerie with other like minded folks.

For a time, Bryan (Kuma) had some interesting generalist RPG theory papers he made, and posted in threads here and there, but while they were interesting they didn't really attract any attention; reads, passionate responses, flames, etc. So all that we're left with for the most part is GNS theory, and a lot of folks confused about "Where do I post now?" that those theory forums are closed, and the requirement at the Forge added to discuss it only through <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">interpretive dance</span> play.<br/><br/>Here, there's lots of game theory being discussed. Some of my favorite threads were speculations of:<br/>* "How do we get players more invested in their characters?"<br/>* "How does music and lighting affect play?"<br/>* "What happens when you play one game using the rules tied to another game?"<br/>* "How can we as a group create a setting?"<br/>* "Can NPCs be 'Situation'?"<br/>* "How come all my Vampire games were never really any fun?"<br/><br/>All the above are theoretical... but they can also be directly addressed by testing, or folks can relay their experiential data into the thread ("We tried this and this is how it worked"). <br/><br/>As soon as we step further and further away from questions that came up from actually GMing and Playing, we move further and further away from the premise of this site. The same was true recently for Game Design discussion, so it was pulled off of this site and moved over to Praxis (that top-right link up there).<br/><br/>======================<br/><b>My Experience with GNS</b><br/><br/>Personally: GNS was awesome when I first encountered it. I read the essays, I got the jist: People come to the table for different reasons; when those reasons are different there can be friction. There were some prescriptions and suggestions from that point, but I had already gotten a lot out of it: I could see in my own game groups why 1-2 people seemed to be dissatisfied, or why when I tried to run a game a certain way others would complain, and so on. I pretty much ditched the idea of having a "one category only" group, and instead focused on my own with ways that I can still hit everyone's goals and have fun, possibly meaningful (in the "fulfilling" sense) sessions. Yay, it worked, and my gaming improved dramatically thanks to Ron pointing that bit out. And I gladly talk about it when such a discussion comes up, but most discussions of GNS are not "did it work for you?", but rather "these categories seem wrong, let's talk about these categories..."<br/><br/>Beyond that, though, I really had no interest in the discussions, or what the prescriptions for correction were (at times: ditch your group, get another), or analyzing the three little categories that the theory proposed as the only ones out there (and in fact drawing the lines in the sand for which behavior/game falls in which category has been the part of the theory which drew so much attention, rather than "Well... did your games actually Improve after reading the central idea?"). <br/><br/>So it worked for me, and awesomely so. But the further Big Internet Discussions that followed both baffled and bored me, so I largely ignored them, especially when it was clear that folks were talking about theoretical stuff and not stuff that applied directly to their sessions, etc (and of course everyone has a pocket example of someone who discussed theory on forums of years because for whatever reason they weren't actually playing RPGs with friends or acquaintances, so the best they could do was talk about playing; likewise examples of people discussion theory because they play 5 times a week and they're just bored/not busy at work; and so on)<br/><br/>=======================<br/><b>GNS and broad theory at S-G</b><br/><br/>As the S-G mod, I prefer of course to see the discussions and theory tied to play, especially questions and discussions that ask (and provide various answers) to the question of "How do I make my next game session more fun?" The "Best of Story Games" category (click on Categories, then The Best of Story Games) is filled with those kinds of threads, if you are looking for examples of what I mean. My own bookmarks links are basically a litany to that question.<br/><br/>The occasional GNS-themed thread that comes up once about every 6-12 months: Just like other side-discussions not really tied to play (like the Movies of 2000s thread that's going on now), they can be interesting. They might go over well, they might go over like a turd in a swimming pool. When too many build up too fast and we start to see 3-4 of them, all actively collecting posts (as GNS theory does), it starts to get a little suffocating. It starts to feel like the Exalted threads bumping out all other conversations over at my beloved RPGNet. <br/><br/>I don't think there's the need to call them out and say "let's not discuss this/let's ignore it", cause honestly it's not that bad currently, and even after talking to the active posters through whispers and stuff, the discussions were already on their way to that slow dive. It just started getting a little stuffy in this room, that's all.<br/><br/>I don't mean to kill all theory discussion where it stands, but yeah that thing I wrote a few years back that Christian quoted above (probably need to change a little bit of the wording to make it up to date), that's pretty much where I still stand on that sort of thing.<br/><br/>However, I do go as far as to encourage people to take GNS and other "broad general gaming theory" discussion to their own blogs (or create another website even), and tell them to go ahead and post in the "Stuff to Watch" threads when they have a new blog post, a cool new insight, a heated discussion, and so on: It's interesting to a lot of us, even if we don't want to see it play out Here, in This Place.<br/><br/>All is Cool.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271501/#Comment_271501" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-15T23:03:22+00:00" title="May 15, 2010 11:03PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 15, 2010 11:28PM by Wordman.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul Czege</cite>Here's my testimony:<br/><br/>1.

I guess I read them because of my fervent desire to discuss my experiences and behaviors, and those of people that I see, to conceptually model them then be able to communicate those concepts with others. As I think you can see in my post, much of GNS speaks to my experience and I can see pieces of it in myself even as I quibble with many of its details. I recognize the drive to use the system to overcome challenges in myself. I recognize the desire to create characters embroiled in a dynamic situation filled with drama, or comedy. And I recognize the desire for the system to create a fully realized world, ready for exploration, and consistent with my expectations of how it should function.<br/><br/>So, I read because discussing these things matter to me, and I enjoy discussing things with people who have vastly different ideas about the subject than I. I value clarity of communication much more than I do agreement. I do wish folks, including myself, would spend more time understanding someone's position, before objecting to it, or worse, ridiculing it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_271562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271562/#Comment_271562" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-16T13:42:57+00:00" title="May 16, 2010  1:42PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Self proclaimed academics should read Nabokov's Pale Fire.<br/><br/>Mark, most applications of GNS that I have seen have struck me as reductionist and dismissive. The act of simply describing play without foisting upon it any sort of prejudice would be admirable. GNS is not that. Levi's What I Like glossary is much closer. It has the good faith to not attempt obscurity when transparency is preferable. The Big Model is not articulated very well. That should be obvious to anyone, or we wouldn't have a topic right now titled "Does Simulationism Exist?" on a forum largely composed of people that have been aware of GNS for YEARS.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271563/#Comment_271563" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-16T13:45:38+00:00" title="May 16, 2010  1:45PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 16, 2010 1:47PM by Thunder_God.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tulpa</cite>should be obvious to anyone, or we wouldn't have a topic right now titled "Does Simulationism Exist?" on a forum largely composed of people that have been aware of GNS for YEARS.</blockquote>\nVeles, to be honest, we still have discussions such as "Does the world exist?" and "Do material objects exist?", "Do General Concepts ("Reds") exist?", and we've all been around, and using them, for <i>quite some time</i> ;-)<br/><br/>Of course, we have people like Wittgenstein, Ryle, and a bunch of others telling us it's the asking of those questions that causes the problem in the first place, heh.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_271574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271574/#Comment_271574" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-16T15:36:02+00:00" title="May 16, 2010  3:36PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tulpa</cite>The act of simply describing play without foisting upon it any sort of prejudice would be admirable.</blockquote>\nI submit to you that this is impossible.<br/><br/>I mean, I appreciate the good word - and lord knows that pure description without bias was my <i>aim</i>.<br/><br/>But I can equally understand people that are willing to be biased because they're trying to <i>get shit done</i>.

To be reflexive, I'm currently a graduate student in Sociology with a focus in what we call Theory. Every RPG theory I've come across is so methodologically ungrounded and poorly operationalized that it might as well be a discussion about moonbats. Not to mention so full of personal assumptions and folk beliefs which are trotted out as 'data' that the whole enterprise seems naive unto belligerence. <br/><br/>I enjoy it when Vincent tries to explain his thinking and conceptualization of design and play. His nomenclature aids understanding and is backed by examples. Usually, you require neither to understand his thoughts on gaming. GNS obscures understanding and. outside the AP posts, is rarely backed by examples. <br/><br/>No one is suggesting that we stop thinking about and talking about gaming, play, design, etc. I would humbly suggest that at this historical juncture we avoid coming up with grand theories and metanarratives about RPGs. Instead, we might want to cultivate local narratives about play.

Vincent in his blog usually explain The Big Model (that include GNS)  :-)<br><br>Anyway, The Big Model is not really obscure: most people when they "get it" say "but it was obvious!" . It's not quantum theory or philosophy, it's simply observation of actual play without a lot of gamer bias.<br/><br/>The "obscurement effect" is simply a result of gaming culture and more in general geek culture (that refuse that kind of observation and the results) and forum posturing (and the usual forum effect of having a lot of people who think they have already understood everything and want to explain it to other making a lot of noise and confusion, so much that it's impossible to get a single answer to a Forge theory question in any place outside of the Forge or where there is a dedicated "GNS Cop" as Vincent Baker)<br/><br/>I always found a little funny that, when in a forum it's impossible to discuss the Big Model without that obscurement effect, the usual response is always "if a lot of people say different things it must mean that that theory is bullshit" and not "man, we really have to find a way to avoid this confusion in theory discussions, it's clear that half of these people don't even know what they are talking about". If kept to the same "standard", Einsteinian Physics would be called "bullshit" too (try to ask question about it to people, and see the range of answers you will get from people who only know it from bad sf movies...)                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271778/#Comment_271778" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-17T22:48:35+00:00" title="May 17, 2010 10:48PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 17, 2010 10:49PM by misuba.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First, Brendan is my new hero. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>Ehm...

Asking about theory terms on S-G.com is more like asking about Einsteinian physics amongst, well, physicists (let's say physicists of Einstein's era, to allow for dissenters, or else my analogy doesn't work either).<br/><br/>I don't interpret this thread as a shut-up thread, as a call to stop discussing anything. I see it as a call to <i>start</i> discussing it intelligently again; to stop leaning on theories and terms with crippling flaws while acknowledging the valuable bits in them and their contributions to the field. Let's have - maybe not here at S-G, but somewhere - a whole lot of new theories. I liked that Cubism Theory bit from last week or so - it wasn't totally Earth-shattering or anything, but it was a new lens.

If I understand correctly, CA isn't a personality type but a "way of playing". I think that current GNS theory claims that the majority of people can enjoy playing in any of the currently identified CAs, even if they tend to have a preference for one over the others. I <i>think</i> it claims that, if the group has heterogeneous preferences, each individual will have more fun by playing in a harmonious CA rather than each pursuing his or her own specific preference.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_272067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272067/#Comment_272067" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-19T13:03:25+00:00" title="May 19, 2010  1:03PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, OK.

But it's that annoying (to some) gap in the model: the Creative Agenda concept doesn't say all that much about play in which the creative agenda of play isn't the priority of the group. According to some people out there (at least some), hanging out and making sure Bob gets a chance to have a fight and Jenny has a chance to solve a puzzle is more important than a harmonized vision of play. I don't really get that, personally, but clearly lots of people think so, else why would people make statements like:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><br/>Find a bunch of people who drift games, ask them why, if the answer is anything other than "because the game's badly designed", or something that can be reduced to that, the claim fails. This questioning has been going on since gamers have been communicating with each other, by the by, and the variety of answers never ceases to intrigue and please me.<br/></blockquote>\nJason, I may be misreading you, but I'm quoting that here because I have heard a lot of people say it in the vein I'm describing: this game is great <i>because</i> these bits don't work with those bits, so we can play it however we want.<br/><br/>Effectively, it sounds to me like those people are either enjoying incoherent play or that they've house ruled the game to the point where it's become essentially a focused game perfectly suited to their current creative needs and Agenda.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_272074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272074/#Comment_272074" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-19T13:13:24+00:00" title="May 19, 2010  1:13PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Find a bunch of people who drift games, ask them why</blockquote>\nDude, people are notoriously bad at effectively identifying their own reasons for doing things.

You basically just said, "Well, okay, what GNS theory says isn't true for some people's play, perhaps even it is untrue for most people's play (though we might debate that if we were statisticians and had a bunch of data about it), but it was absolutely true for MY play."  And that simply goes against the goal of the theory and its own explicit statements.  The theory isn't attempting to just describe your experiences. It is attempting to define all play that occurs in the hobby, including mine and everyone else who has plenty of fun making up house rules, playing Vampire in a story-oriented way, and wasn't damaged by it and didn't end up in power struggles.  If all you're saying is "it makes sense to ME", that's great, we can explore that further, but if you then say "therefore the theory is correct", that's beyond silly.  <br/><br/>I wouldn't advance a theory of story-oriented gaming that said "Narration-passing mechanics are very bad, because the key element of story based play is identification with characters - the further you step away from your character, the further you step away from meaningful decisions on their behalf." even though I've played in groups where that is absolutely a true statement.  If that had been my only experience, I might foolishly believe that what I knew was a general statement about story-oriented gaming, and I would be rightly laughed out of the room. Theory is not about you.  It simply isn't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272079/#Comment_272079" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-19T13:19:18+00:00" title="May 19, 2010  1:19PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 19, 2010 1:19PM by JDCorley.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dan Maruschak</cite><br/>Dude, people are notoriously bad at effectively identifying their own reasons for doing things.

Some may very well be inaccurate, and others perhaps self-deluded, but can we learn nothing from what we say to each other? Even in such numbers?  Anyway, all that has to be done is find one person who drifts things for reasons other than bad design and the claim falls apart.  Since I can find a hundred in a day, I think the onus is on the theory to prove they're all liars or insane or whatever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

reliable. This isn't RPG theory bullshit, it's something we know from psychology, economics, etc. Humans tend to make emotional decisions and post-hoc rationalizations. Discussions about preferences are usually conducted with the post-hoc rationalizations and are therefore problematic. People have been discussing what kind of romantic partners they want for <i>far</i> longer than they've been discussing RPGs but people still tend to be really bad at figuring out what they actually want.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Anyway, all that has to be done is find one person who drifts things for reasons other than bad design and the claim falls apart.</blockquote>\nThis is just silly.

That to me says that you have to prove universality - that there are objective standards applicable to everyone, and that these are those standards.  But you're right, that's my own extension/interpretation. I'll just say that even if you think half the people who are talking about how they've customized games for the last 20 years are self-deluded, the overwhelming majority of the remainder still aren't drifting in response to bad design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272087/#Comment_272087" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-19T13:46:04+00:00" title="May 19, 2010  1:46PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tulpa</cite>Why GNS is harmful: It is prescriptive of play, whether or not intentionally.</blockquote>\nMight as well just quote it again.<br/><br/>Let's look at it linguistically.

Sure there are things like Robin Laws work on player types or the threefold model of GDS but they look at the issue from inside the heads of a single participant.  The strength of GNS is that it steps back and looks at a group actions and how it's members interactions show a groups goals for a game .  In a largely social hobby that's a pretty important consideration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_272179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272179/#Comment_272179" name="Item_125" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-20T07:18:29+00:00" title="May 20, 2010  7:18AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Vernon R</cite>I think GNS is still relevant largely because no one else has proposed an alternative view. </blockquote>\nLots of them have been proposed.<br/><br/>Most died in a fiery hailstorm of "Let me compare this to GNS, loudly, and now we'll have that fight instead."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272180/#Comment_272180" name="Item_126" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-20T07:36:28+00:00" title="May 20, 2010  7:36AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's true Levi.  The problem with proposing something new is that to replace the old standard it has to say everything that was said before yet still have something new and worthwhile that makes it superior.  There's not a lot to be gained if its just a rephrasing of what was said before, it just confuses things if all we are doing is changing the names and not the ideas in any significant way.  I dont want to have to learn two codexes of terms that mean the same thing so I can talk to different people who may have been exposed to either.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think one of the things that helped GNS (and the threefold before it) gain in popularity is that they were both not just coldly discussing the terms but they were actively advocating for certain playstyles.  Ron Edwards was a strong advocate for Narrativist play and to discuss those innovations it really helped to understand the theory.  Likewise most of the discussion of the threefold was brought up by players who self identified as simulationist.  I think there is some sort of social or psychological link that strengthened the connection to the terms used with the preferences of the users, but that's just me waxing philosophical I'm no psychologist.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_272199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272199/#Comment_272199" name="Item_127" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-20T10:11:49+00:00" title="May 20, 2010 10:11AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Find a bunch of people who drift games, ask them why, if the answer is anything other than "because the game's badly designed", or something that can be reduced to that, the claim fails.</blockquote>\nI think attacking the ability of the respondants is the wrong approach.

In other words, my wife is not a fan of narration-passing systems, but does her preference make Primetime Adventures a badly designed game? If she likes other things in PTA (say, the Traits-Concept-Issue-Fan Mail-Budget stuff) but not the high-card-narrates stuff, is she making a mistake by customizing PTA in some way instead of sitting there with her thumb up her ass waiting for someone else to come out with a game that does exactly what she wants in every way?  I think it is absolutely obvious that the designer did NOT make a mistake by making the decision they did, and it is absolutely NOT bad for my wife to customize the game to her liking, and customization is in this case one hundred percent a positive experience and zero percent negative, and has zero to do with bad design.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Weeks</cite>And it's important to note the context.

Is that a mistake?)</blockquote>\nNot so much disingenuity, but yes, it's intentional, because if you say "well, if you only change trivial things, that doesn't count", you're again throwing in the towel, because it's quite possible that my wife might see changing the narration-passing of PTA as being a trivial change to a minor annoyance in a game she likes whereas others, perhaps even the designer, see her change as a horrendous intrusion and a complete catastrophic collapse of their intentions.  There is no line anyone can draw that would differentiate trivial changes from catastrophic ones, so I conclude that there is no line, a change is a change is a change.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_272261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272261/#Comment_272261" name="Item_139" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-20T18:38:58+00:00" title="May 20, 2010  6:38PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason,<br/><br/>Very interesting stuff--I really enjoyed those last few posts of yours, they've got me thinking.<br/><br/>So, what do <i>you</i> see as signposts of bad design?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272264/#Comment_272264" name="Item_140" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-20T19:31:57+00:00" title="May 20, 2010  7:31PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>So, what do<i>you</i>see as signposts of bad design?</blockquote>\nGreat question.  It's something I've thought about a long time. I'm still thinking about it, whenever I read a new (or old) game.  It's very difficult for me to answer, seeing as I see all game texts (and other materials) as toolkits for play - no matter how focused they are, the players still bring the actual play to the table, not the designer. In RPGs and other story games, the players bring an overwhelming amount of creative material to the table due to the extremely wide bandwidth of choices that they have in every moment of play.  Even very strict and very focused RPGs have this quality.  It is one of the greatest things about the hobby.  It is in fact the very reason I like to play.  But that makes evaluating a design extremely challenging.  To some degree there really is no difference, in a player's experience, between a bad design decision and a design decision that doesn't accomplish what the player wants.  They will experience those two things exactly the same way and walk away just as disappointed with both.  This is not a mistake on the players part - they are the same thing, in play experience.<br/><br/>I absolutely agree with the System Does Matter essay, in that there are bad designs and good designs, and the intent of the designer is a big part of that question, but my dilemma is that I think that designer intent has the same relevance to a play experience as  bandsaw designer intent to a carpentry experience.  That is to say, if they're really going in an absolutely different direction than you want them to, it can be a big problem, but that is pretty rare.  Conversely, just because the tool was made well, or even brilliantly, doesn't mean your result will be bad or good.  <br/><br/>Look at Lady Blackbird, this is a great example. Here is a game/module that is made for one thing and one thing only.  It even comes with pregenerated characters and situation.  Yet play experiences with this game vary dramatically.  Even the groups' interpretations of the sort of world it's set in vary dramatically.  In no conceivable way could it be said that two different groups playing Lady Blackbird are creating the same play. Indeed, there are people who play it and don't like it.  It doesn't fulfill their desires, whatever those are.  Yet they are "playing the same game" as people who make an entirely different fiction which might have been much more satisfying for them.<br/><br/>I guess the most important thing - and here I am pointing out the positive rather than the negative, so I am still dodging your question a little - is clarity and accuracy in terms of what the game will produce.  It is good to seek a fictional result and promote it and communicate it clearly to the players and bad when that doesn't happen. <br/><br/>Let me give an example. I love GURPS. But nowhere in any version of GURPS does the game say "Hey, by the way, it's pretty hard to dodge things in GURPS, unless you put some effort into being good at it." or "As you can see, a regular old average guy on the street will have a hard time surviving more than a single gunshot."  That is a problem because both those things are true and until you get some experience with the system, you might not know that they were true, which can put you in a bind where, to achieve the fictional goal you were after with the game, you have to make a change <i>in situ</i> and without clear preparation.  That's a bad design decision, not to communicate those things to me.  But it is not a bad design decision to make those two things true.  Nor (for example) if I decided to change those two things and make it easier in GURPS to dodge or make it easier for an average guy to survive more than one gunshot, is that a sign that GURPS has made a mistake.<br/><br/>Here's another example - in most editions of Vampire (actually all, until the most recent, and maybe even the most recent depending on how you read it), you can buy Backgrounds, which include things like Contacts, Allies, Influence and Resources.  The acquisition of those four things are at the center of political games. Yet the price for their purchase at character creation is ridiculously low compared to powers and skills that are far less useful in political games.  You can easily create a starting character who has already won the political game before the game even starts, if you use your Background points wisely.  In fact, given how hard it was to obtain Background points in those editions, you were foolish not to spend your points on those things at the beginning.  This is a bad design decision - to give the option and support, even the support of this very system - to the play of political games, but to price things in such a way that you don't even need to play to achieve everything you need to achieve in the fictional world you're creating.  But it is not a bad design decision to include Backgrounds in general, or those backgrounds in particular, and in a non-political game such as punching guys while wearing trenchcoats, the price is not even a bad design decision.  So even in this bad decision there is still something good that will produce good results for a lot of people playing the game.  If I don't acknowledge that, I'm being dishonest.<br/><br/>Both of these are really about accuracy.  You want your game to produce the fiction people expect it will if they follow most of the instructions  (it's vanishingly unlikely anyone will play the game exactly as the designer wants, or at least vanishingly unlikely that I will.)  In the case of GURPS, the problem was that the fiction created was likely to have some relevant traits that are not clear from the text.  In the case of Vampire, the problem is that one of the ways of using the tool is well-supported but others are  problematic and that's never explained (perhaps nobody noticed? This is why playtesting blind is so amazingly important.)<br/><br/>There's also something in here about rigidity and flexibility.  The reason I used the Vampire example above is because the game is very flexible, and this is a <i>very good thing</i> about it.  You're not locked into using everything word for word and comma for comma. If I want to change something, for the most part, the game will still run well.  But as I noted in the example above, the flexibility has limits.  Not only do you have to express those limits well, you have to choose them well. But I don't have a clear picture of this.  It's difficult to describe because there are two relevant factors here - the flexibility of the material to hit the target that players want to hit, and, when the game is changed too far, how it fails and how easy it is to diagnose the failure.  On the one hand obviously I don't want any play of any RPG to flop.  But on the other hand there is nothing wrong with losing a few chess games humiliatingly badly while you learn.  I think it's a legitimate design decision to let players be unhappy with a game until they understand it better.  (Here I am thinking of your first Champions build, or Burning Empires. You really fucked that up, didn't you?  But you saw that if you kept at it, it would get better. And it did, right?)  <br/><br/>I am very cautious about making theoretical statements about what the whole hobby is like. I bet there are some good counterexamples out there that could make me back off of even these ideas. I think we've got such a huge and ill-defined hobby  that you have to be extremely skeptical of any theory purporting to explain it. (Not to mention we're operating in the virtual absence of data.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_272265">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272265/#Comment_272265" name="Item_141" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-20T19:33:52+00:00" title="May 20, 2010  7:33PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 20, 2010 7:37PM by David_Berg.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is marketing included in "design"?

Knowing those things helps us tweak games more purposefully.<br/><br/>When I started checking out Swords and Wizardry, I was very excited to ... well, not customize the game per se, but improve upon it. Dungeons and Dragons fans seem to have forever had this mentality about their game - we can make it more (realistic/balanced/flavorful) if we try. But when I started tweaking the Dwarf class, I went online to see what other people's ideas were, and I was disappointed - - most every single suggestion made was focused on the internal logic of the setting, and nothing else. I am all about internal logic as opposed to pure "game logic" - regardless of the somewhat errant conclusions of this <a href="http://ptgptb.org/0017/bishops.html" rel="nofollow">Places to Go, People to Be</a> article, and thus am highly amused and appreciative by/of Tunnels and Trolls' commitment to giving game mechanics literal explanations in-setting (spells cost money because of a Wizard's Guild, of course, and only wizards can buy spells because only wizards are members of the Guild, of course!).<br/><br/>So. My dwarfs. I decided that Dwarves in S&amp;W should have their movement reduced to 9 instead of 12, should have a limited "small size" choice of weapons, and should be immune to encumbrance penalties; in other ways they are unchanged from the basic rules. Oh, and I removed their level restrictions. I made these changes both out of a sense of balancing the Dwarf and the Fighter in relation to one another AND to make dwarves make a little bit more sense to me - the bonus to saves vs. magic was interesting, as was the trap detection, and these traits spoke of a certain concept of dwarves that was only half-realized. So I kept going, in a way that makes them fundamentally a different choice from Fighters (which is important - tactical players need meaningful options to choose from), to sort of a slow, sturdy detector-character. Actually, now it sounds kind of like a henchman class.<br/><br/>When my fellow S&amp;W posters had eyes only for the "realism" of the rules (ha, whatever THAT means), it made me sad - their changes felt inelegant, bespeaking (possibly) a lack of deeper concept of game design beyond the superficial. I think "System Does Matter" could also be put as "Rules Are Something, All Right (As Opposed to Nothing)".

I really get what you're saying about how if the user changes or mods a game in some way that doesn't necessarily mean the designer made a mistake.  <br/><br/>I *don't* agree that there's no line between trivial or superficial changes and fundamental ones.  In fact, a big part of my experience with "bad trad gaming" has been with GMs who modded games without a) informing players ahead of time that they had changed the rules (there's that nasty "consent" idea again), and b) thinking through the effects of their changes.  I'm going to focus on b) right now and give an example.<br/><br/>I was playing in this 3.5 game.  There were a number of issues with the game, including inconsistent player base, but this one time, the GM sends an email to the group, telling everyone that he was concerned about how vulnerable the small-hit-die classes were and that he wanted to give all characters automatic max HP for their level.  I'm sure you see why this was actually a terrible way to address the problem: it makes the HP disparity between, say, fighters and wizards, TWICE AS LARGE.  I calmly wrote an email laying out all the math and got him to change it to, "instead of rolling for HP everyone simply gets their expectation value in HP" (note that this is essentially what 4E did).<br/><br/>There was a similar thing where he had changed the way death and dying works, completely not realizing that it totally rendered useless one of the Cleric classes main features, namely the 0-level spell Cure Minor Wounds.  I got him to change that back again after going through the numbers.<br/><br/>How does this incident relate to the relevance or lack thereof of GNS?  Well, the way I see it, and saw it at the time even (this was '07, well after I had first read Ron's essays), D&amp;D is supposed to deliver a Gamist experience for the group, and this (poorly-thought-out) rules change was going to mess with the challenge level of the game in a really screwy way.  I didn't use the word "gamism" in my reply to the group, of course, because it just would have been confusing, but it absolutely was the motivation behind my thinking.<br/><br/>So, you gotta understand, my own suspicion of GM's or even groups that drift their games simply comes from expertise in the relevant non-RPG area of study, namely mathematics.  I suspect that you, JD, have an unusually high degree of either mathematical knowledge or simply intuition into how to mod games without fucking them up and making the original perceived problem with the RAW worse.  Most gamers don't have either of those things.<br/><br/>On the other end of things, I really wouldn't care if a GM made a setting change like, "Dwarves have no beards" or something.  (OK, that's more silly than your example of changing the number of clans in Vampire, but I still think there's a clear and bright line between mechanics and setting.)<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272277/#Comment_272277" name="Item_144" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-20T22:17:26+00:00" title="May 20, 2010 10:17PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt, I think your post highlights the contrast between concrete experience and pure abstract conjecture - as in, hey look!

But even I flub things up.<br/><br/>You were able to identify the flub because you were able to identify the <i>goal of the change</i> and decide that the change wouldn't get you to the goal.  In other words, it wasn't that there was something inherently bad about giving everyone their max HP. There's nothing objectively wrong with that change, and I think everyone can imagine goals for which that change is exactly right.  But it was the wrong thing to do to obtain the goal.  And under no circumstances could anyone say that random HP generation in D&amp;D3 was a bad design decision because this guy decided to change it either with maximum HP or "expected" HP, as you suggested.  Nor does it make any sense to say that he should have put aside D&amp;D3 and found some other game instead of changing D&amp;D3 to achieve what he wanted in the fiction he and the group were generating.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_272284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272284/#Comment_272284" name="Item_147" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-20T23:29:31+00:00" title="May 20, 2010 11:29PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 20, 2010 11:32PM by noclue.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>There is no line anyone can draw that would differentiate trivial changes from catastrophic ones, so I conclude that there is no line, a change is a change is a change.</blockquote>Actually, from what I have seen, unless the meaning of Drift was redefined at some point, he's talking about shifting from one Creative Agenda to another, usually through ignoring or altering the use of a rule or rules. He's deliberately not just talking about any ol' change or house rule, regardless of its level of triviality.<br/><br/>So, the term Drift (as Ron was using it) depends upon the acceptance of the existence of CA. Otherwise, your criticism reads that GNS concludes that "changes to the system" are the result of bad design. And that's not what it claims. And I'm not arguing the validity of the claim, just trying for clarity here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272285/#Comment_272285" name="Item_148" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-20T23:38:15+00:00" title="May 20, 2010 11:38PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On a total tangent, I find it interesting that some folks get miffed if this GNS/CA stuff is discussed without refernce to AP, but are totally fine discussing it removed from things like historical context (both within the hobby and in society more generally), player base populations, or financial issues, and the interactions of all of those things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_272286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272286/#Comment_272286" name="Item_149" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-21T00:04:32+00:00" title="May 21, 2010 12:04AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 21, 2010 12:05AM by JDCorley.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite>Actually, from what I have seen, unless the meaning of Drift was redefined at some point, he's talking about shifting from one Creative Agenda to another, usually through ignoring or altering the use of a rule or rules. He's deliberately not just talking about any ol' change or house rule, regardless of its level of triviality.</blockquote>\nYes, that's the definition, but remember that the allegation of the theory is that Creative Agenda is expressed primarily using system.  Creative Agendaz are "any matter of imaginative interest", aesthetic priorities and goals.  Even without getting into what specific selection of GN or S we're talking about, it is for aesthetic and imaginative reasons that house rules, modifications, omissions and fudging of any ol' type, occur. That is the whole motivation for their existence.  If someone decides "dwarves in this game do not have beards", even before we worry about GN or S, the theory states clearly that we have shifted our Creative Agenda and Drift has occurred, since we have altered a system (gone from "the text tells us about dwarves" to "the GM tells us about dwarves", remember, "the GM decides" is a system) for aesthetic reasons.  We may even remain inside the same big CA category of GN or S, or maybe not, whatever, but drift has definitely occurred.<br/><br/>Yes, seems very minimal, even trivial to some, but let me challenge that perception.  This change was of enough imaginative importance for a player to think "This should be changed."  That to me actually reflects a significantly higher importance to the play experience than, say, a designer's (unquestionably important) decision to use percentile dice or a die pool. In other words, if it's important enough to the fiction for living, imagining, participating players to house-rule, it's probably a hell of a lot more important to the fiction than virtually everything in the dead, insensate text of a far-distant designer no matter how central to their vision of the game.  <br/><br/>I can say that in my 3-clan Vampire game, the fact that there were only 3 clans was of enormous importance to the fiction. It really produced a major effect on the feel of the game and the experience of the players. This fact was not just thrown out there, because if it was, who would bother creating it, we'd have a 7 clan game like normal if it wasn't important.   It was of great importance to the story, my planning, their character decisions, and fictional experience.  So I agree with the theory that places where we omit, change or pretend to ignore the delivered system is of great importance.<br/><br/>Where I differ with the theory is that I think that drift is good and reflects a healthy interest in pursuit of a fiction that is of interest to the participants at a particular table, and it is to be encouraged and celebrated, and the theory claims drift is bad, and is indicative of bad, harmful design, and should be minimized and if possible, eliminated. (That it's not possible to eliminate drift is, I suppose,  a deep, deep tragedy, instead of the greatest thing about this hobby, the very best thing in the world about it.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted

these would all be interesting approaches and I'd love to hear what you think about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt

               Sometimes you play a game (and the scope, focus and complexity of the ruleset helps influence this choice) completely following the rules.  Sometimes you house-rule and adjust the setting (either pure fluff or rules-connected setting stuff).  We have the range of game systems and experience now for most groups to be able to do this.<br/><br/>A minority of people are still telling us, using labels like "drift" and "incoherent" that this is bad.<br/><br/>So one day the people in my gaming community will get together and play a one-shot of Beat to Quarters or Slasher Flick with a goal of a very tight focus on the literary and cinematic genres those games are emulating.  We will attempt to play those games following the rules as closely as we can.<br/><br/>Some other day, one of us will want to play in the beloved Dark Sun setting and will re-work Savage Worlds to fit in this setting because he likes the speed and fun of the gameplay at the table and feel it has the best chance of capturing the feel of what he enjoyed about the original iteration of the game.<br/><br/>Everybody has fun on all three occassions.<br/><br/>The problem with GNS is that someone will tell us we are either not doing it right or try to explain how what we are doing fits perfectly into its theory.

A lot's been talked about at the Forge. I read these crude summations of thousands of discussions and I do have to wonder whether it's reading comprehension, laziness or something else.<br/><br/>Is Drift always a bad thing, for example? Last year Ron posted extensively about a game of D&amp;D3 for which he \u2013 wait for it \u2013 drifted the rules. My own view is whether or not one wants to do it, you will quite likely get some useful feedback from the archives at the Forge on people's own experiences and applications.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272318/#Comment_272318" name="Item_154" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-21T06:38:30+00:00" title="May 21, 2010  6:38AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 21, 2010 6:42AM by Beth_in_Virginia.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Walker,<br/>I agree that Drift and Incoherence are used negatively. The words feel negative in the English-speaking mouth, to be certain.<br/>How I've seen Drifting manifest in AP reports at the Forge is, essentially: the poster is asked to explain their Drift up front, to avoid confusion. That's it. <br/><br/>Jason, in such an AP post, any such changes (ANY! ^_^) would undoubtedly be brought up by the poster, for either relevance or completeness. <br/><br/>However, Walker, you're misusing the term Incoherence - it doesn't have anything to do with house-ruling. Its main definition is <blockquote>"Play which includes incompatible combinations of Creative Agendas among participants. Incoherent play is considered to contribute to Dysfunctional play, but does not define it."</blockquote> The rest of the listed entry <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/_articles/glossary.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> relates to other definitions and such, so I didn't include it. <br/><br/>Incoherence is often seen in short-hand as an attempt to simultaneously give equal spotlight to multiple CA's. Plenty of games have a Narr angle with Sim acting in support, or Gamist with Sim support; having multiple CA's in evidence is not the issue per se. The "per se" usually refers, in practice I've found, to when a game design attempts to handle all three CA's with equal weight, or at least more than one. <br/><br/>For example - <i>World of Darkness</i> has hundreds of pages dedicated to setting material, but (thankfully) all the metaplot and what-have-you is not actually mechanically relevant unless you make it so (i.e. yes, System is everything that happens at the table, period, but if a particular piece of it is only in use if you care to employ it, as opposed to it being connected to the rest of the mechanics, then it's irrelevant). At the same time, the rules are fundamentally based on the D&amp;D/etc. model of individual warriors with special powers, who fight combats in a particular way. Finally, there are essays in the texts that give suggestions on how to tell a good story through your <i>World of Darkness</i> game. <br/><br/>That's a crack at Incoherent design, speaking theoretically, because you have a game that likely draws people in for the vivid setting material, but its mechanics alternately give you magic powers that focus on the Why (why is it so, explain it to me!) and then, for guns and combat and stuff, clearly focus on the What (what are my options in this challenge?). Combine that with an overall self-assessment that the game promotes good story-telling (how? Essays are not the same as mechanics, mannnn), and you have a game that's telling you it does one thing and clearly does another. IN NO WAY does this mean you can't have fun or that there's something inherently wrong with the game - merely that from a very specific design perspective, <i>this game has some conflicting priorities</i>. <br/>That bit about dysfunctional play in the definition says it all - sure, it could exacerbate a situation in which folks are already having trouble getting their goals met by the play experience, but it's not going to be the sole cause.<br/><br/>Very importantly, most Glossary terms that refer to Dysfunction actually deal with player behavior, not with game design - powergaming, Typhoid Mary, turnin', wimpiness, etc., all point to behavioral player issues, NOT to games or game texts. Even the contentious Illusionism concept is fundamentally a human issue, not a game issue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_272329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272329/#Comment_272329" name="Item_155" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-21T07:46:46+00:00" title="May 21, 2010  7:46AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JD,<br/><br/>So, OK, drift of the rules is not a sign of bad design, you say. But unclear explanations and directions--unclear marketing--are? <br/><br/>If so, we agree. And I'm sure so would any hardcore "Forgie": a good design has rules that support what it claims to do, and, vice versa, it claims to do what the rules support. When this is properly carried out, this allows the gamer looking for a particular thing to pick up the rules that give them that particular thing, resulting in a fun time. Those two go together pretty tightly, I would think.<br/><br/>As for the whole "dwarf beards" issue, I think that, for me, personally, the Big Model helps explain where that line lies. I do NOT believe that dwarf beards and, say, a GM's limitations to creating monsters of a certain Challenge Rating--or even the GM's right to describe what monsters are in the game, or what they look like--are in the same category it all. The former is a detail of the fiction that we presumably all can agree on, or agree to disagree, or whatever. If you say, "in my game, all PCs are thieves," I can say, "OK, sure!" Or maybe, "How about I play a wizard, but his *profession* is stealing stuff, he just uses magic to do it?" <br/><br/>But the Big Model's concept of "System" is the set of interactions that allows a group to bring into life some kind of interactive fiction. It's about the interactions between the participants, and how they relate to each other. All of us agreeing to stick to three Vampire clans changes the game, yes, but the way we play the game and decide on what's happening in the fiction, and who rolls when, etc, is still exactly the same. Meaningful changes to System, in my opinion, require that we actually change how the players interact with each other at the table: who says what when, how conflicts and situations are resolved, what new situations are brought into play, etc.<br/><br/>There's a huge difference between changing some of the details of a particular game, which may or may not be Drift (e.g. giving people more hit points) and changing the way the game shapes the form of our gaming as a social activity (e.g. "How about the players now decide what monsters go in the dungeon?").<br/><br/>Also:<br/><br/>What I find odd about your account, JD, is that you seem to totally ignore the difference between "I changed some stuff in the game to get a different effect" (e.g. let's all play thieves this time around!) and "I had to change the rules, because they were screwing up my game" (e.g. I need to raise people's odds of Dodging, because everyone keeps dying in the first five minutes of play, and the game claimed it was an action adventure). Am I misreading you?<br/><br/>I don't think it's always <i>easy</i> to tell the difference between those two, but I find it hard to believe anyone would claim that they aren't two different things, at a fundamental level that "theory" (i.e. my understanding of game texts and design) should address.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272330/#Comment_272330" name="Item_156" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-21T07:53:20+00:00" title="May 21, 2010  7:53AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Davis</cite>IN NO WAY does this mean you can't have fun or that there's something inherently wrong with the game - merely that from a very specific design perspective,<i>this game has some conflicting priorities</i>.</blockquote>\nThat is one way people have tried to rehabilitate the theory, but I don't really think it succeeds. The essays make it very clear that Vampire is damaging and will lead to power struggles among players, and this understanding of the essays has been confirmed for year after year. If Vampire doesn't hurt people, if it doesn't inevitably lead to power struggles, if its conflicting priorities are not flaws, then the theory is wrong.  The theory doesn't just identify games with conflicting priorities, it makes a value judgment about them. They are bad and damaging. This value judgment cannot be wronger.  If a game has a lot of different priorities, it can be good or bad, helpful to a wide variety of groups to achieve a wide (but naturally not infinite) variety of preferences, or it can be a mess, or it can be good in places and bad in places. Vampire's conflicting priorities, or, as I call it, flexibility, is a very good thing about it. As I point out above, there are also things in it that are clear flubs, but to say "Groups can play Vampire in all sorts of different ways...and this proves Vampire's inferiority to games that can only be played one way." is addleheaded. <br/><br/>It assumes a sort of foolish unconsciousness on the part of players - that they (somehow) aren't aware of their aesthetic goals, and don't make changes to games to pursue them, but instead for some other reason. The theory didn't close with an urgent call to educate the hobby about probability, so that our drifting of numerical rules could be sound and get us where we wanted to go. The theory didn't close with an urgent call to educate the hobby about acting techniques, or improv techniques, or how to make a compelling character come alive for an audience, reader or listener, so that when we pursue our aesthetic goals in these areas we are better skilled at deciding what drift will get us where we want to go. Heck, if the narrativism essay had been "Hey, here's what this Egri dude thinks makes for a compelling story, I bet we can use this", you'd probably see me citing to it all the time.  If it did promote these things, you probably would see me with a sign on my shoulder saying "Read The Essays" out marching like everyone else, instead of crossing the line like a filthy scab. But it did not promote any of those things. What it promoted instead was a <i>design</i> standard, one that seems insane even on first glance: that the mark of a good, superior game is that it produces one and only one type of play.  And it claims to prove that this design standard is universally true, not "true for some groups" or "true in some people's experiences", but instead absolutely and positively true for everyone forever. There is no way to respond to this other than to say that it is wrong.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_272332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272332/#Comment_272332" name="Item_157" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-21T07:58:45+00:00" title="May 21, 2010  7:58AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: walkerp</cite><br/>Everybody has fun on all three occassions.<br/><br/>The problem with GNS is that someone will tell us we are either not doing it right or try to explain how what we are doing fits perfectly into its theory.

But - and I'm so tentative about this that as I say, I'm even half taking it back right now - remember that a game that can be played in many conflicting ways successfully is not a bad game. So just the existence of conflicting or unclear text doesn't create bad design. You have to go deeper than that. (Malcolm Sheppard had an <a href="http://www.mobunited.com/mobunitedmedia/2010/05/14/yeah-ill-tell-you-what-to-do/" rel="nofollow">interesting blog post</a> in which he advocates for <i>outright conflict</i> between what the game says to do and what its mechanical systems permit you to do, saying this creates tension that is resolved creatively at the table. I don't know that I'd go so far as to call this a good feature of a game but...yeah, he's right about that. A game that gives you an interesting problem can be compelling.)  But in general, yeah.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>But the Big Model's concept of "System" is the set of interactions that allows a group to bring into life some kind of interactive fiction.

However, even under your definition, there's a big change in system here, from "the book tells us about how vampires are organized" to "the GM tells us how the vampires are organized". In your all-thief example, "the book tells us about what classes we can play" to "the GM tells us what classes we can play" to "the GM, with suggestions from players, tells us what classes we can play".

In both cases you have some aesthetic goal you are driving after, using the tools available to you in the game. The main difference is when these changes happen?

Quite often, you see people saying "the game does this" or "the game was designed like such and such"; however, that isn't really what is happening, at least in my head. When someone says, "I designed a game", what they are really saying is "I designed a <i>product</i>". The <i>game</i> is something that happens when people sit down and use both that product and their own minds to play.<br/><br/>I hypothesize that if some elusive, perfect theory of roleplaying game design exists, it will have to explicitly deal with this difference between <i>product</i> and <i>game</i>. An important axiom of such a theory is that "the designer only has control over the product, not the game". Another would be that "players are assumed not to have had any control over the production of the product". (Naturally, neither of those is always true, but I'd think that's how you'd have to proceed to make a theory real.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_272340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272340/#Comment_272340" name="Item_161" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-21T08:19:57+00:00" title="May 21, 2010  8:19AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 21, 2010 8:45AM by Paul_T.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason,<br/><br/>I may only be speaking for myself here, but that last post of yours is fantastic.

There's absolutely nothing bad about a game being focused.  I'll even defend a degree of inflexibility, if it is rightly communicated.  ("Don't change this, if you do, here's the 1000 things that will go wrong!" versus "If you don't play AD&amp;D with time sheets, you're not doing it properly!")  I am completely cool with that as a design goal.<br/><br/>I have no opinion on the composition of the RPG hobby. (I am really suspicious of any claims about the composition of the RPG hobby.)  But even if you concede that a non-focused or multi-priority game takes some time to get going, that's not, as you point out, inherently a bad thing.  It takes a while to set up a Battletech scenario, or to find a parking space at the local sporting arena, but the time invested is not wasted or lost, even if we get a bit annoyed at it sometime, the pleasure of the experience overwhelms the annoyance.

My strongest games that have come out of "scattershot"/non-focused RPGs come not from RPG subculture, but instead from my participation in <i>literary subculture</i>.  My best Victorian games come when I read a ton of Victorian fiction and nonfiction.  My best fantasy games come when I read a bunch of fantasy and watch cool fantasy movies.  My mystery gaming improves and improves if I read more mysteries, in more traditions, and think a lot about them, and discuss them with people.  Now of course, my gaming also improves when I discuss a game with experts on the game, but to say that it's required...well, that kinda is really off base, because there was no universal gaming subculture before the Internet, and I could even see a strong argument that there isn't one now, which would make a lot of play that actually occurs essentially impossible.  But at any rate, the best practice in getting better at deciding what you want and deciding what you want to do to get it is to develop more knowledge about your tastes, however it is you do that. I'm a story gamer, so I read/watch/experience a ton of stories to improve my gaming.  Others might play a lot of board and card games.  Some LARP and costume. Others read nonfiction.  <br/><br/>To say "you have to be immersed in gaming subculture to play and enjoy D&amp;D3" (or any of those) is really unsubstantiated. I mean, maybe it's true or maybe it's not, but it seems beside the point to me, and primarily of interest to people trying to make money at this, not enthusiasts like myself.  Even if it could be shown that it was true, well, you have to be a chessplayer to play and enjoy the kriegspiel variant, that isn't of great significance to kriegspiel-, variant-, or chess-players, but only to the people trying to sell kriegspiel to the kids at Christmas.<br/><br/>It is absolutely true that I have no commercial aspirations with respect to story games, and that, no doubt, colors how I see this compared to those on a forum whose primary purpose was to help people design games, many of whom had an idea that they eventually wanted to sell it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_272364">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272364/#Comment_272364" name="Item_165" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-21T10:58:20+00:00" title="May 21, 2010 10:58AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>But even if you concede that a non-focused or multi-priority game takes some time to get going, that's not, as you point out, inherently a bad thing.

For example...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dan Maruschak</cite>Could you say the same thing about a game like chess or poker?</blockquote>\nI don't think so. When people sit down to play a game of chess, the expectation of what they are actually doing is shared fairly universally by the players, the "designer" (whoever the designer of chess was) and observers. Even if they are deciding to play some obscure variant of chess, once that choice is made, that's it... they are slavishly aping what the designer of that variant intended. They are not pulling in their own experience to collectively twist and pull the type of game they are playing. (You could, of course, design some variation that <i>did</i> do this, but that would then be closer to an RPG and not really the point of your question.) I think the same reasoning also applies to poker, though there is a (tiny) bit more improvisational room in poker, and it has a lot more of the social "negotation" that RPGs do. Variations of poker are probably more widely popular in comparison to those in chess, but still the designed variations are played without any tinkering specific to that session.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dan Maruschak</cite>How about writing/reading a novel?</blockquote>\nIt has some similar aspects, but isn't interactive, so is not the same. It's similar in that the designer of the product (i.e. the author of the novel) may have goals for the design, but no ability to push them other than the product itself. It's similar in that the reader will be bringing a whole battery of baggage and experience to the reading and, in that sense, will not have read the book in the same way someone else might. But all this is one way: into the readers head, where it stays. RPGs are different than this experience. There is an iterative feedback between players, for one. For another, this feedback can move nearly anything about the experience (tone, plot, outcome, focus) in ways that are not possible with reading a novel. And, that whole process not only matters to the game, but is necessary for it to exist.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272376/#Comment_272376" name="Item_168" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-21T11:34:55+00:00" title="May 21, 2010 11:34AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wouldn't short-sell Matt's point about drift not always being easy.  "We thought this game was gonna produce X, and it doesn't quite, and we're trying to change it to fix that, but doing that is hard," is quite common in my experience.  Don't you ever try 3 different approaches to Cleric hit points, finally get it right, and then wish the designer had done it for you?<br/><br/>If I market a game as "immersive", and then it isn't, okay, that's bad marketing.  But if I'm marketing it as "immersive", chances are that my design intent was that it in fact be "immersive".  So now that's bad design too.  <br/><br/>And if it's not immersive because I'm simultaneously trying to resolve moral quandaries and my game can't do both at once, and I hadn't thought about how that might be a bad idea, then it's bad design born of ignorance.  <br/><br/>There are many ways such ignorance could be cured; talking with other designers, playtesting critically, etc.  Maybe reading some GNS stuff has a place in there too.  Is there some other "how to design an RPG" info-trove on the internet that renders all things Forge-based completely superfluous?

Even if they are deciding to play some obscure variant of chess, once that choice is made, that's it... they are slavishly aping what the designer of that variant intended. They are not pulling in their own experience to collectively twist and pull the type of game they are playing. (You could, of course, design some variation that<i>did</i>do this, but that would then be closer to an RPG and not really the point of your question.) I think the same reasoning also applies to poker, though there is a (tiny) bit more improvisational room in poker, and it has a lot more of the social "negotation" that RPGs do. Variations of poker are probably more widely popular in comparison to those in chess, but still the designed variations are played without any tinkering specific to that session.</blockquote>\nI think you're conflating several things here. I didn't think that your original point was "lots of people apply house rules to RPGs" but that the consumers of RPG products contribute a lot of themselves to the process of playing an RPG. Although I'm not a big player of either chess or poker, I know that there's a dramatic difference in the subjective experience of play based on who your opponent is. Doesn't the "previous poker experience" of your opponent matter a great deal in terms of how they will play the game and what <i>you</i> need to do to play the game?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wordman</cite><br/><cite>Posted By: Dan Maruschak</cite>How about writing/reading a novel?</blockquote>\nIt has some similar aspects, but isn't interactive, so is not the same. ... There is an iterative feedback between players, for one. For another, this feedback can move nearly anything about the experience (tone, plot, outcome, focus) in ways that are not possible with reading a novel.<br/>Your original point was that the designer and players of an RPG don't interact except via the medium of the product, which seems very similar to the non-interactive author/reader relationship to me. I don't see why there's such a dramatic difference between the fact that the consumer is a group in one case but an individual in another.

I see what you are after. The "what <i>you</i>need to do to play the game" is a matter of strategy once the game begins. In other words, such choices are about <i>how</i> you are playing, not <i>what</i> the game you're playing is or <i>why</i> you are playing it.\n<blockquote>Would you say the same thing about the script for a stage play that you say about novels?</blockquote>\nAbout the <i>script</i>? Yes. About the <i>actual performance</i> of a play? No. The actual performance is much more like an RPG.<br/><br/>I guess what I'm really talking about here is three things: let's call them product, game and play.<br/><br/>For an RPG, the product is a game book. The game is how a group puts that game book (and probably other game books, their own desires and knowledge, etc.) to use figuring out what they are playing that session. The play is the execution of the game. (Note that what is usually referred to as "actual play" is really the combination of the game and the play.)<br/><br/>For a stage play (<i>from the point of view of the performers</i>), the "product" is the script. The "game" is all the casting choices, alterations to the script, direction and such. The play is the actual performance. (To the <i>audience</i>, the performance is actually a product (which works a lot like reading a novel does).)<br/><br/>The difference with poker, chess, novels, etc. is that, insofar as they even have a "game" stage at all, it is almost insignificant to their enjoyment. With chess, the play portion is nearly everything. With novels, the product portion dominates. With the best RPG sessions, usually all three pistons are firing. (And, I suspect, why they succeed depends a lot about how choices in one enable choices in the others.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes" title="frozenwastes"><img alt="frozenwastes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/062/nIVJF3PC5XJ0G.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes">frozenwastes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272451/#Comment_272451" name="Item_172" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-21T23:58:18+00:00" title="May 21, 2010 11:58PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My favorite thing about this thread is that the theory talk within this thread largely doesn't mention GNS.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_272456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272456/#Comment_272456" name="Item_173" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-22T02:03:56+00:00" title="May 22, 2010  2:03AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 22, 2010 2:12AM by Hans_c-o.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dan Maruschak</cite><br/>Are you sure about that?

It's that, really, Creative Agenda is expressed at the Ephemera level, too (think about a high roll with a die: the high-five and the victory dance of the player has nothing to do with a gamist agenda? Really?), at the techniques level (or are you saying that the combinations of techniques used is independent from the CA?), it's at the Social contract level (the choice of game to play, for example).<br/><br/>It you think that CA is only at the level of exploration, I think that you are thinking about it only at the CHARACTERS (SIS) level, not at PLAYERS (real world) level.<br/><br/>GNS is still a big part of the Big Model, seeing that the model recognize, at this model, only THREE creative agenda (this does not mean that every group has only three way to play, by the way: but other differences are about a single level of the model, like for example different situations or different systems or different social contracts). The big difference is about the names ("Right to dream" instead of "narrativism" for example) and the specific definition (the definition of simulationism of GNS is obsolete, for example. Even the one in the essay is, because it was written before the concept of "creative denial" was formed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_272611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272611/#Comment_272611" name="Item_181" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-23T10:37:00+00:00" title="May 23, 2010 10:37AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Moreno, <br/>Thank you for that explanation! I honestly was having a hard time grokking the Big Model's innate relationship to CA, though I knew that CA informed so much of general play and choices in techniques and so on.<br/>The "mood" a person is in when it comes to CA will inform what rules make sense to them, what rules seem applicable and valid, and this echoes through the rest of play altogether. I know for myself that hardcore attempts to cover lots of tactical details and such are not something I'm interested in, very much at all. Neither are big ol' settings with tons of information.<br/>These are both mere preferences and they also inform what kind of play I tend to be interested in - games that focus on a gripping story or an over-the-top caper tend to attract me the most. Ron and (presumably) others have talked about that link between Story Now and Step On Up, and for me the link is that I need to get lots of narrative power to push the scenario the way I want it to go. I have sandbox skills, of course, and don't object to other people getting lots of say, too. In fact, the more we all get lots and lots of input, the better!<br/>But because of the way that a lot of "mainstream" GMs interacted with me, I avoided dungeon crawls and their kin for a long time after I got into indie games, convinced that scenario-based play would rob me of my creative input.<br/>Then I played Storming the Wizard's Tower a couple of times, and I figured out that what I saw as creative input was really just meaningful input, period. I can fairly equally appreciate a challenge or a collective story-telling, and for different reasons. The former, though, required me to recognize the existence of GM-as-referee before I knew I was safe, there - - literature on playing 0e "correctly" has further elaborated on this important difference between Illusionist/GM-as-crystal-ball play and, well, something else altogether.<br/>When you start with the mentality that one person should facilitate, not "run" or "rule" the game, that's going to lead to some pretty different ideas about how the game should be played, how the rules should work, and how folks should interact *with* those rules. In the case of Polaris, it helps to have one person or more who's played it before, just to keep everyone following the rules so all players have an equal amount of power and agency. <br/>In the case of, say, Storming, it's up to the GM to interpret the rules for the benefit of fairness and consistency while the players tear across the game-world, again so they have equal access to agency and power between themselves, and so they aren't unfairly ganked by a bad guy or a trap of some kind. Consent, informed consent, to be dramatic about it, seems to be a thing I've been hunting for in my RPing, and even 0e games have that, in their own sort of way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272617/#Comment_272617" name="Item_182" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-23T11:17:07+00:00" title="May 23, 2010 11:17AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 23, 2010 11:17AM by nemomeme.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joel</cite>DAMMIT!!!<br/><br/>I saw Brendan today and totally forgot to ask for my dollar and/or hug!<br/><br/>Oh well.

You've given me something to think about and restored my desire to go read old threads, blog posts and the like.<br/><br/>The rest of this post is from the perspective of someone who still thinks categorized CA isn't helpful and that the three categories still only exist for social internet identity reasons:<br/><br/>You've also reminded me that the theory is not the thing just like the map is not the terrain.  For example, all of your questions presuppose the usefulness/existence of CA as it's own thing.

Techniques are the means through which a given arrangement of exploration priorities are expressed (whether or not they explore the element the way the designer intended).<br/><br/>For me, I'm thinking that what is being explored (and it's arrangement compared to other elements) is more important and useful than figuring out which three predefined categories the given event of play fits into or making assumptions about things based on what CA is presupposed to be in effect/desired.  What element of exploration is focused on by the decision made by the participants involved?  As for which game they choose, why not talk about it in terms of the specific elements the participants are planning to explore?<br/><br/>*I've always wondered why the main targets of two of the CAs weren't represented in the elements of exploration.  So I generally add theme and challenge to the elements of exploration.  When you don't need CA/GNS to exist as it's own thing, you can start talking about actual decision making that explores the elements traditionally seen as the goals of agonistic and thematic play.  Until then, "theme" and "challenge" aren't up for grabs as things you can explore, but are stuck as overall meta goals.  Sad for simulationism that it doesn't get such a lofty position.  Guess that's why people argue that it doesn't exist.  And they'd be right, because as soon as you take "theme" and "challenge" away from the other two sacrosanct agendas and put them where they belong as things you can explore, gamism and narrativism vanish as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272662/#Comment_272662" name="Item_192" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-23T15:12:52+00:00" title="May 23, 2010  3:12PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK all, time to get in your closing arguments before the yearly GNS thread gets sunk as similar threads do, ETA approx 24 hours.<br/><br/>Anyone is of course welcome to take the discussion offsite, linking to where they are taking some aspect of the discussion, etc.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_272671">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272671/#Comment_272671" name="Item_193" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-23T16:00:13+00:00" title="May 23, 2010  4:00PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm taking the ego-fueled, bile-heavy smacktalk to <a href="www.twitter.com" rel="nofollow">Twitter</a>.<br/>Or, at least, someone should.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272672/#Comment_272672" name="Item_194" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-23T16:01:17+00:00" title="May 23, 2010  4:01PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: frozenwastes</cite>You've also reminded me that the theory is not the thing just like the map is not the terrain</blockquote>\nOn this, I absolutely agree. NOTHING is better than playing games, to understand how games work.<br/><br/>This tie with something Vincent Baker (I think) said once: that these days, people don't discuss theory by debating in forums, but by writing games that show and demonstrate what they say about games (if you go read the forge threads of 2001-2003, its interesting to see how many arguments against what Ron and others said would have been eliminated by simply playing some later games. How many obsolete idea about "what a rpg is" would be updated by simply playing My Life With Master, Dirty Secrets or 1001 Nights... it would be more effective that trying to "convince people" with hundreds of forum discussions.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: frozenwastes</cite>For example, all of your questions presuppose the usefulness/existence of CA as it's own thing.

It can't work alone), but as a way of talking about these things. If used by people who know the meaning of the terms, can really speed communications and improve clarity.<br/><br/>If used with people who don't know the meaning of the terms, it's worse that useless, it's misleading (and this is the cause of much of the backlash: Big Model terms shouldn't be used outside of a community of people who agree on their meanings. Using them when you talk with your players or with people here or rpg.net is simply wrong).<br/><br/>But I think that people who are really interested in gaming theory owe themselves the effort to really learn forge theory. At least if they really want to understand what happened in indie gaming design in the last ten years...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_272674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes" title="frozenwastes"><img alt="frozenwastes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/062/nIVJF3PC5XJ0G.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes">frozenwastes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272674/#Comment_272674" name="Item_195" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-23T16:08:12+00:00" title="May 23, 2010  4:08PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>No, I presuppose the utility of CA (and the rest of the model) not as "it's own thing" (for one, it's absolutely worthless if not in the context of actual people playing.

And I would propose that it takes the form it does not because it's the most useful form, but because of internet identity reasons.  People put in a lot of years into discussing GNS and weren't ever going to let it or it's primacy go.  You can see Ron Edwards start to let it go in his 2003 essays where GNS is inside the model rather than piercing through it, but over the next few years of Forge discussion it gets brought back as this all pervading thing that aligns everything.<br/><br/>I see the road not taken as being far more useful and free of all the baggage that still comes along with GNS, whether it is intended by those still discussing it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272681/#Comment_272681" name="Item_196" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-23T17:26:20+00:00" title="May 23, 2010  5:26PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mcdaldno</cite>I'm taking the ego-fueled, bile-heavy smacktalk to<a href="http://www.twitter.com" rel="nofollow">Twitter</a>.<br/>Or, at least, someone should.</blockquote>Actually, it's interesting to note how little bile and smacktalk has really surfaced in the last page of discussion.

For myself, the idea that people play these games for fundamentally different and possibly incompatible reasons is reinforced by my own experiences and reading a lot of internet discussion. At any rate, the idea goes back to the 80s at the earliest.<br/><br/>I personally think that Ron's 'skewer' image was an elegant way to demonstrate that all the choices you make in setting up an RPG, from the chosen game and setting to how you spin it, to the relationships among the group, to the very atmosphere at the table, contribute to the final effect. I honestly cannot see how that closes anything off.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272690/#Comment_272690" name="Item_200" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-23T19:19:31+00:00" title="May 23, 2010  7:19PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 23, 2010 7:22PM by Moreno R..">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: frozenwastes</cite>People cling to GNS for purposes of internet identity politics</blockquote>\nI don't know..  there's really anyone who "clings to GNS"? The definitions changed a lot during the discussions at the forge, and every time the change was discussed and accepted without anyone screaming "nooo! My old definitions! I cling to them!"<br/><br/>It could be said that the people who really cling to GNS are the haters, because it give meaning to their life (and they don't ever change that, they really cling to that hate).<br/><br/>I think that I agree that, for the most part, internet (at large) gaming theory discussions are about identity politics. When the Forge was "new" and there was the impression that it was the place there "the cool avant-garde guys are" a lot of people went there to "share the glow", without bothering to learn anything concrete about GNS before starting to use the words as put-down on other people or to give themselves some status as "gaming theorist".<br/><br/>Ron didn't gave these people satisfaction, stomping any of this in the forum, so a lot of these people turned to a different way of getting an internet identity: they become forge-haters, or began to talk about "post-forge design" and of the Forge as being "the old thing".<br/><br/>Story-games, for most of these people, was a god-send: a place where they could be with the "cool kids" and share the glow, without that bothersome Ron and all the rules of the Forge. But to be in the place where the cool kids go, you have to say that the old place is not cool anymore (if not, it could steal a little of your new coolness). So now story game is the place of choice for theorist-wanna-be who never talk about actual play, and for people who want to  feel "cool".  And these days, if you want to be "cool", you have to distance yourself from that old, boring Forge.<br/><br/>It's all right for the Forge. The people who really made the Forge what it is never cared much for "cool". They cared for what WORKS.  The place that is really being damaged by this is story-games.<br/><br/>I think, for the good of this place, that we should really try to making it "uncool".  To get more truth and less posing in here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12114/gns-please-stop/p3" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12114/gns-please-stop">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12114/gns-please-stop/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12114/gns-please-stop/p3" rel="prev">3</a><a class="Highlight p-4" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12114/gns-please-stop/p4">4</a><a class=" p-5 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12114/gns-please-stop/p5" rel="next">5</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12114/gns-please-stop/p5" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F12114%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F12114%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>[GNS] Please Stop. - Page 5 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12114/gns-please-stop/p5" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="[GNS] Please Stop. - Page 5" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12114/gns-please-stop/p5" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content='Moreno R wrote: I think, for the good of this place, that we should really try to making it "uncool".

The only problem with it is that it gives short shrift to the "Story Now" agenda, turning it into a sub-category of mimicry. On the plus side, it produces multiple ways of talking about immersion, and one could use Walton's <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mimesis-Make-Believe-Foundations-Representational-Arts/dp/0674576039" rel="nofollow">Mimesis as Make-Believe</a></i> to argue for the priority of game over story--that is, to suggest that every fiction is at root a game of make-believe.<br/><br/>Of course, having done that, you'd have to make a game to see what it meant.

I've yet to see a serious treatment, but I've myself thought that Ilinx might be a convincing explanation for a type of immersionist-advocated play; this would imply a separate CA mode of "immersionism" as sometimes discussed. Experts on Ilinx-type immersionism seem to be uninterested in the Big Model (and writing rpg texts, notably), which might be why we've yet to see any in-depth look on the matter. Still, some discussions with Finnish immersionists (the sort that does equate roleplaying with an altered state of consciousness at a drop of a hat) indicate to me that there are people out there who find this phenomenon of immersion central to their interest in roleplaying. Whether it's a CA-type interest or something else (or even real; I'm not quite convinced) is what would be interesting to find out.<br/><br/>I'm less convinced of the distinction between Agon and Alea, they smack of intellectualization of a psychologically joint phenomenon: as orthodox gamist theory has it, the psychological drive behind both skilfull and luckfull competition is the need to overcome challenges, and while we can rationally distinguish whether you actually can influence that resolution yourself, this does not change the fundamental phenomenon of confronting challenges, but rather only our perception of which challenges might be worthwhile for us.<br/><br/>And then there is narrativism - as you said, Bill, Caillois ignores a phenomenon that is pretty conclusively existant. Not surprising when you remember that Story Now didn't really come to be widely practiced in ludic play before the '70s; Caillois couldn't have seen it in any real-life examples he considered.<br/><br/>Still, I for one wouldn't mind seeing CA analysis that does not utilize GNS, Caillois or otherwise. This seems to be hampered by the fact that only people who don't have a problem with GNS seem to also find Big Model useful and interesting, and therefore we're left to choose between GNS-accepting theorists and theorists who don't understand Big Model. This is not necessarily surprising, of course, as the Big Model might very much be characterized as modeling the influence of creative drive on the social activity that is roleplaying; take out GNS and you're left with a model in search of a message.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_272998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272998/#Comment_272998" name="Item_207" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-25T12:10:01+00:00" title="May 25, 2010 12:10PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Still, I for one wouldn't mind seeing CA analysis that does not utilize GNS, Caillois or otherwise.

I just don't think A/A/M/I are any better or worse categories than G/N/S.  The categories in both sets are horribly broad, and include smaller-scale elements that look like each other.  If we keep clear about the distinction between large-scale rewards and moment-to-moment fun, either set works, and if we don't, they're both crap.<br/><br/>How does Gamist Roleplay look when compared to something like Chess?  Is it basically a mimicry activity with some moments of agon for spice?  Or is it true agon, just like Chess, only using some mimicry techniques instead of a board and pieces?<br/><br/>If you can conclude that Creative Agenda exists at as large a reward scale as any meaningful agon/alea/mimcry/ilinx distinction, then it seems to me that Story Now is actually left out.

It is analogous to the game board in Chess, one might say. Therefore gamism is true Agon/Alea that just happens to exist within the SIS instead of on a board.<br/><br/>Does "Mimicry technique" make sense? Perhaps it does, those Caillois categories aren't CA modes after all. If Mimicry is a reward in itself, though, then it seems to be basically similar or even the same as GNS-simulationism.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273004/#Comment_273004" name="Item_210" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-25T12:44:06+00:00" title="May 25, 2010 12:44PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, yeah, I know that's what Ron claims when he's talking about how G and N and S are <i>really different</i>.

I'd like to think that Callois would today amend his list of possible rewards of play <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>As for gamism vs. agon, we need to remember that Gamism is not an observable phenomenon, it's a defined name for a postulated psychological mechanism only perceived indirectly in behaviour. From this viewpoint it doesn't matter whether Ron's right about Gamism being qualitatively different from something else - it's how he's defined Gamism, and that definition happens to entail the idea that Gamism uses the SIS as a game board for something that is, again, defined as that same thing Caillois calls Agon/Alea (the pleasure of challengeful play, to be exact). Therefore we can easily say that Gamism is an underlying explanatory mechanism for Agon &amp; Alea whether Gamism exists or not; it's described in a certain way, and while it's possible that the described thing does not exist (I understand that some people think so), we still know that were the thing to exist, it would be the underlying phenomenon of Agon &amp; Alea.<br/><br/>Right, so that was clear as mud, and secondary anyway. Onwards:<br/><br/>Those are good diagrams, very clear. As I described above, I find the GNS description of Gamism more convincing as an underlying cause of play than Agon and Alea - those two categorizations mix Gamism with some relatively arbitrary technical matters, namely the question of how a challenge is resolved. The fundamental question is whether the general urge towards challenge exists as a human psychological need; if it does, then Agon and Alea are essentially manifestations of the same impulse. As we know, Ron doesn't comment on the psychological particulars - he limits himself to observation, and his observation (as mine) seems to support the idea that Agon and Alea are different manifestations of the same need for excitement.<br/><br/>Then again, I can totally see how one might observe a different subset of gaming and never see the essentially arbitrary transformations between Agon and Alea that happen especially in modern gaming, which use Alea and Agon routinely and mix them any which way. Compare that with sports (almost all Agon) and gambling (almost all Alea); if that's all you're observing, I'm not surprised that Agon and Alea seem like separate drives - after all, you don't usually see gambler sportsmen.<br/><br/>Does Mimicry even refer to Creative Agenda? If it does, it sure sounds like simulationism in that both are psychologically explained as entertainment derived from imaginary interaction as a value by itself. Just like simulationism, it takes exactness to distinguish between the mimicry you do for its own sake from mimicry as a goal and value derived from play. The former is a technique, the latter is a CA.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273014/#Comment_273014" name="Item_212" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-25T13:56:03+00:00" title="May 25, 2010  1:56PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 25, 2010 1:57PM by David_Berg.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm.  Well, it sounds plausible that, at a CA-equivalent level, you've got some basic human psychological drives, and Challenge is one, and that breaking it down into sub-categories belongs at a more fine-grained level of analysis.  But I dunno, man.  How do we break down psychological urges?  If I'm feeling the need for speed and I go skiing, and then I'm feeling the need to prove my wits and I play Chess, and then I want the thrill of uncertain monies and I buy a lottery ticket, who says which of those urges are more fundamental?  <br/><br/>Who says that ilinx isn't really about challenge too?  In some ways, challenge is inherent to games and their artificial constraints, so you could argue for putting it at a higher level than A/A/M/I on that basis.<br/><br/>I particularly liked this phrasing of Alea from Callois:<br/><br/>"[chance] signifies and reveals the favor of destiny.  The player is entirely passive: he does not deploy his resources, skill, muscles, intelligence.  All he need do is await, in hope and trembling, the cast of the die."<br/><br/>If you buy that as a psychological urge that motivates someone to do an activity, that seems pretty separate from agon to me.

I really don't think I could ever be dissuaded of that.<br/><br/>However, I CAN imagine myself being impressed with a better description of Creative Agenda than GNS.  Right now, GNS as broad classifications of Creative Agendas works for me.  I think they're fairly accurate.  But, at times, I think they're too broad (all of them) to really be practical beyond diagnosing catastrophically problematic play.<br/><br/>I think the next big step in theory is really at the Techniques level because I've been rapidly, rapidly learning that even WITHIN a shared Creative Agenda preferences in Technique can be equally as problematic.  However, they're more subtle and don't usually cause as dysfunctional a result as full CA clash.<br/><br/>I think discussing Technique clash is difficult for a few reasons.<br/><br/>1) You have to be sure you really are working within a shared CA and not across a CA boundary.  Otherwise you're talking at cross purposes.<br/><br/>2) At some point you're talking about highly specific, highly localized manifestations of CA.  For example, my own preference for personal and group revelation in play.  I think that preference can ONLY be served by Story Now play but I don't think it's definitional for Story Now.  Discussing Technique clash can only happen in an environment where people can articulate their highly localized CA so as to determine whether the Technique moves them closer or further away from it.<br/><br/>So to get to that (I think) important Technique analysis we need a method of discussing individual nuances of Creative Agenda.  Oh and by the way, Ron, I think, tends to classify most perceived nuances in CA as "a matter of Technique"  In other words, the nuances ARE the differences between Techniques.  But I'm not sure I agree with that.  I don't think "personal and group revelation" is a Technique.  I think it's a localized FORM of Story Now.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273028/#Comment_273028" name="Item_214" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-25T15:12:38+00:00" title="May 25, 2010  3:12PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I always agree with Jesse on everything.

I still don't like the censorial attitude some have on GNS in favour of (currently non-existing) alternatives, but I've no problem with the idea that CA might be described in different ways. Saying otherwise would be like saying that the only way you can discuss elephants ever is by considering their mammalian qualities.<br/><br/>Also, specific and individual Creative Agenda detached from any GNS identity politics is definitely the real meat of roleplaying. Consider: if this were otherwise, there would only be three roleplaying games, as those three would do everything people would ever want with increasing perfection as they're fine-tuned. This is plainly not the case, however, and that's because Creative Agenda has many parts that can be tickled better or worse by different approaches - different techniques. I'd like to say that the best thing I get out of GNS is that once I'm able to clearly verbalize that I want to do premise-ful play or whatever, that allows me to set aside all the other vistas and focus better on the smaller nuances that were never available to me when I spent all my time trying to negotiate the big basics. I'm not even necessarily talking of dialogue with other people; merely being able to tell myself what I want is such an useful focusing tool that I'd never have gotten anywhere with game design without it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273035/#Comment_273035" name="Item_215" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-25T16:07:30+00:00" title="May 25, 2010  4:07PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The keen observer will note that I support the existence of the thing Creative Agenda says it is. You'd have to be an idiot to say that play can take place without <i>any</i> "matters of imaginative interest", aesthetic priorities or goals. Even if the primary reason to play is social, and we're just hanging out and not giving the game a lot of thought or investment, RPG play just plain can't happen without people expressing <i>some</i> collection of interests, aesthetic priorities and goals for the imagined/collaborative world. I just dispute that the G, N and S categories are particularly helpful or coherent (koff) categories of those collections.  I doubt I'm the only one with this reaction.

The notion that descriptions of CA like GNS should be at root pragmatic game design tools strikes me as dead on. The further implication is that, because of the multiplicity of possible agendas for play, any particular description of "why people play" or "what people get out of playing" serves a normative function as well, helping to create the culture of play it purports to describe--at least insofar as people subscribe to it as a guide to design and play. This is as clear a case of the reflexivity of knowledge as one could ever hope to encounter.<br/><br/>In the case of GNS, one thing that it does very well--as Eero rather astutely points out--is call attention to a mode of play that it calls "narrativism." When you think about it, you realize that this mode is actually rather obscure, a kind of play that works by having one stand in a kind of alienation or distance from the character one plays in order to more strongly appreciate the moral weight of the decisions the character makes--this in contrast to the strong <i>identification with</i> character that is the desideratum of immersive play and the <i>elision</i> of character that is the hallmark of competitive play. <br/><br/>One side effect of this way of slicing up the phenomenon, as people use it to explore the design space that results, is that purely gamist designs become interesting as a way of examining the negative space of narrativism--in other words, of challenging the basic assumption of narrativist play and saying, hey, what if there's no character, not really, it's all just a contest between us here at the table, via the medium of a set of rather elaborately detailed pawns. It recapitulates the hoary old narratology versus ludology debate in a new form.<br/><br/>But another side-effect is to make "simulationism" inexplicable, or even pathological. I remember seeing a post on Vincent Baker's blog to the effect that while he understood gamism and he understood narrativism, simulationism struck him as puerile wish fulfillment power fantasy at best. I seem to recall the subordination of simulationism in some other context having driven David Berg to distraction, given his efforts to make sense of and reclaim the term. And I think the reason for that is that once you make yourself aware of the distance between player and character, and use that as a tool in your designs, then you have a tough time with a mode of play in which minimizing or hiding that distance is a sine qua non.<br/><br/>So in devising an alternate set of CAs, the answer to the "why bother" question (i.e., "why bother coming up with an alternative to GNS?") has to be in order to reveal a different space for play, or to open up new possible avenues for design, or minimally to render us more sensitive to the alternatives that may exist.<br/><br/><b>Part Two: Reconstructing Creative Agendas</b><br/><br/>What follows should be read with an eye on Eero's remark that the absence of narrativism from Callois's scheme has to be attributed to the paucity of "premise-ful" modes of play in the instances of play he examined, and that were he around today he'd surely incorporate that into his scheme. In other words, our theories should be constructed in light of the empirical evidence available. On the other hand, I always assumed that the reason that Caillois identified four categories--rather than three or five, say--had something to do with the linguistic structuralism associated with the Paris School of Semiotics, in which a huge semantic space is produced by the conceptual entanglement of opposites. So a "positive" term implies (the existence of) a corresponding negative, like yes implies no. But those terms can be "entangled" as <i>both yes and no</i> (i.e., "maybe") and as <i>neither yes nor no</i> (i.e., "I don't know"). Similarly, agon (skill) implies its opposite alea (not-skill: luck or chance). And those opposites can be entangled such that "both agon and alea" can be understood to mean mimicry, as successful mimicry is at once a skillful (albeit not wholly competitive) performance as well as a willingness to subject oneself to the dictates of fortune. By the same token, ilinx is clearly "neither agon nor alea" in that the dislocations or dissociations one experiences in ilingic play obviate both skill and luck. <br/><br/>Now, in this post-structuralist era, we don't believe that our categories are in any way <i>essential</i> or <i>fundamental</i>; they are analytic conveniences only.<br/><br/>So what happens if we imagine agon, alea, mimicry, and ilinx as the corners of a semiotic square? First of all, we notice that the underlying distinction in both the agon-alea and mimicry-ilinx pairs has something to do with the activity of the player; in the former, the player is active while in the latter the player is passive, in the sense that he or she is the <i>object</i> of the forces acting in the game, whether that\u2019s the turn of the wheel of fortune or the elasticity of the bungee rope.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.personal.psu.edu/wjw11/Caillois%20CA.png"/><br/><br/>Secondly, we notice that the underlying distinction in both the agon-mimicry and the alea-ilinx pairs seems to be that the former in both instances presume the unalloyed agency of the player whereas the latter see the player as part of the field of play. In other words, whereas in both agon and alea you play the game, in both mimicry and ilinx the game plays you. You adopt a new persona, take on a new role, feel scared or excited, or otherwise lose control of yourself.<br/><br/>But these dualities are capable of being entangled, and we can use those entanglements to rebuild the CAs. We\u2019ll follow Eero in suggesting that the combination of agon and alea is the Contest, in which players are interested in victory as the outcome of play. Conversely, the combination of mimicry and ilinx is Drama; players are interested in experiencing thematically resonant moments as the outcome of play. So far we\u2019ve reconstructed the Gamism/Narrativism dichotomy in slightly different terms.<br/><br/>Looking at the orthogonal dimension, starting with the combination of agon and mimicry, I\u2019d suggest that the appropriate metaphor or model is the Pageant, where players are interested in the skillful performance or faithful recreation of alternate roles. Its converse, the combination of alea and ilinx, is the Thrill Ride, in which players are willing to subject themselves to external control in return for the promise of a powerful or pleasant emotional experience. The effect of this, I\u2019d say, is to reconstruct Simulationism as a kind of \u201cagonistic mimicry\u201d that stands in the same relationship to \u201cImmersionism\u201d as Narrativism does to Gamism.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273104/#Comment_273104" name="Item_221" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-26T07:58:32+00:00" title="May 26, 2010  7:58AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is one of those light bulb moments for me. Back in the day, when I posted on the Forge to try to understand what was going on in my gaming group, I had a long discussion with Ron. My problem was that from the outside, they made it look like they were a group of people with a strong preference for Simulationist play.  They recreated rations in their kitchen and weighed them to make sure the in-game weight was correct, they built a highly consistent world, drew maps based on weather patterns, and whatnot. But when it came to play, Sim didn't happen.  Instead, Ron showed that the social reinforcements were all Gamist: rewarding Step On Up, and conversely, punishing player failure.<br/><br/>After looking at Bill's graphic up there, I think I have further refined my understanding of what was going on. Because Pageant and Contest are so close, I didn't recognize which side of the divide they were on. Maybe they slipped without knowing it as well.  On the other hand, the player preferences were along different points of that scale, but it still mostly worked (though one of the players clearly was a more passive player and would have had more fun on the Thrill Ride side, and he constantly frustrated the very active player).<br/><br/>So thanks, Bill. I think I'm going to get some good use out of this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273105/#Comment_273105" name="Item_222" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-26T08:00:08+00:00" title="May 26, 2010  8:00AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 26, 2010 8:07AM by Paul_T.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very nice, Bill!<br/><br/>How strong do you think the level of "alea" in the Pageant has to be?

Imagining seven-day LARP sessions in a Swedish campground makes it clear to me that ilinx can definitely have a role in RPGs, beyond the emotional dislocation that can accompany a particularly intense bout of Story Now. <br/><br/>One thing that does come to mind - I recently read someone's suggestion that Sim "should be" better described as the quest for Discovery. In light of this Caillois/Edwards theoretical mashup, I think Discovery *could* count as ilinx, at least if one takes the definition of it pretty broadly. And yet, I don't think there's room for the collective imagining of new places in this model - strictly speaking, that isn't mimicry, is it?<br/><br/>When a friend of mine gets all excited about reading up on the nine worlds of <i>Nine Worlds</i>, that doesn't seem to really be about a faithful recreation of anything per se. The Pageant seems to be taking a shot at explaining the Emulation side of Sim, where we find genre, specific licensed properties, and physical causality being faithfully rendered. <br/>But that's different from the imagining of new worlds altogether - since that's undoubtedly a dislocating experience and it opens one up to something larger, I could see it falling definitely in ilinx, and mayyyybe in alea, but, at the same time, it doesn't seem to share much with what I had conceived of as an example of Thrill Ride play.<br/>Thoughts?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273119/#Comment_273119" name="Item_225" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-26T08:40:11+00:00" title="May 26, 2010  8:40AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let's take this conversation to a <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=12184" rel="nofollow">new thread</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12114/gns-please-stop/p4" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12114/gns-please-stop">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12114/gns-please-stop/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12114/gns-please-stop/p3">3</a><a class=" p-4" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12114/gns-please-stop/p4" rel="prev">4</a><a class="Highlight p-5 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12114/gns-please-stop/p5">5</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F12114%2Fx%2Fp5%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F12114%2Fx%2Fp5%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
