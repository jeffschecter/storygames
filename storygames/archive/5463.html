At Dreamation with Clinton, Joe, Paul, Terry, Julia, and Tom.  Emily and Tobias facilitated and had roles to play.  It was a great and inspirational game.  I'm so excited about this I'm going to pee myself, so watch out.<br/><br/>It\u2019s jeepform; drawing on techniques from tabletop, long form improvisation, the LARP world, and maybe other stuff.  You can go read about it <a href="http://jeepen.org/" rel="nofollow">here</a>; The Upgrade is available <a href="http://jeepen.org/games/upgrade/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  <br/><br/>The entire game is positioned as a television broadcast and takes place, on the surface, in real time.  You stay in character.  The physical space is divided into four sections \u2013 a set of couches facing the cameras for the live broadcast, and play spaces for scenes acted out in past, present, and (possible) future.  Character ownership is fluid, and it\u2019s not uncommon for two players, inspired, to jump up and do a little vignette in the future to add some direction and color to a scene underway in the present.  This alone was worth the price of admission, because it isn\u2019t something that is done much, or well, in our little world.<br/><br/>About half-way through there was a \u201ccommercial break\u201d and the action cut to a TV mogul\u2019s board room, where everyone took on the role of a producer and critiqued the show in progress.  We talked about each character, and crassly commented on their interest to viewers and what could be done to punch up the ratings.  Erik needed a makeover.  Mauno was probably gay \u2013 was that good for ratings or bad?  Basically, we had a metagame discussion mid-game about the direction things were going, how to make them more fun, interesting, and colorful, and what was going well \u2013 all without breaking away from in-character play.  Really brilliant and totally stolen as of now.<br/><br/>The show\u2019s \u201chosts\u201d, GMs in disguise, controlled the flow of action when it flagged by prompting interview questions of the contestants, and rolling tape (tapping players to act out scenes in the past, or the present).  It could have been strongly orchestrated but there was no need \u2013 once the players saw how things worked, we ate it up.  Interestingly, the techniques we latched onto were quite different from those popular with, say, Italian players.  We liked the past and present spaces, Italians like monologues.  <br/><br/>Playing the Upgrade (and later at Dreamation, Night of Nights) was huge for me \u2013 I\u2019ve been watching this stuff and supporting what Team Jeep is up to and even using some of their techniques, but I haven\u2019t had a chance to try it out until now.  I\u2019m very excited about some of the possibilities it offers, and The Upgrade is really a "training wheels" sort of game - it gets deeper, weirder, and maybe better.  There is going to be more jeep-style play around here real soon, and it is going to kick ass.  <br/><br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of8uncOmN2c" rel="nofollow">Here's a little video of us after the game.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ptevis" title="ptevis"><img alt="ptevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ptevis">ptevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122418/#Comment_122418" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T13:12:24+00:00" title="January 28, 2008  1:12PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I\u2019m very excited about some of the possibilities it offers, and The Upgrade is really a "training wheels" sort of game - it gets deeper, weirder, and maybe better.</blockquote>\nYeah. Right after The Upgrade, I played Drunk &amp; Disorderly with Emily and Tobias. The Upgrade was a great introduction to the techniques of Jeepform, and D &amp; D showed me more of what it can do (which is to say, give me one of the most intense gaming experiences I've had).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122422/#Comment_122422" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T13:21:28+00:00" title="January 28, 2008  1:21PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Same with <i>Night of Nights</i>, which I got to play with Ryan Macklin and Alexander Newman.

It was incredible. Why? It challenged me, made me nervous, forced me to deeply connect with the other players, was a great deal of fun, made for great memories to retell later, and questioned how I view roleplaying games. Probably my favorite Dreamation event. <br/><br/>Jason and Paul, I'm not sure how similar The Upgrade was to Doubt but playing really helped underline a few differences between many LARPs I've played and what little Improv exercises I've participated in. Doubt was much more structured than many LARPs I've played in terms of plot, characters, and scenes. But at the same time, much less structured in terms of player interactions (mostly talking) than Improv. Improv has many guidelines on how to interact with other participants. Doubt seemed to have very large super structures to really get you to buy into the situation and feel what's going on but doesn't want to constrain your reactions to the super structure. It doesn't want you to be a character divorced from who you are. Or construct dialog in any specific way. It wants you to be you and push your own emotions to the surface. It's feel similar to method acting in that way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122452/#Comment_122452" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T14:26:19+00:00" title="January 28, 2008  2:26PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 28, 2008 2:26PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, John, Joe and Clinton and I were all very much at home, because jeepform pushes back where Chicago-style improv says "stop" - it welcomes (mandates, hard-codes) plot and "story" instead of avoiding them, it welcomes meaningful conflict and allows you to explore it without aggressively editing.  it felt way more natural to me than long-form improv does.<br/><br/>I didn't know <i>Doubt </i>happened!

I have no practical experience with Johnstone, only book learnin', so keep that in mind.  But it struck me that jeepform has a lot in common with that, much more than Chicago style.

I love playing improv, but it seems like doing it the hard, hard way. Working with a tense or explosive situation with structure to help you play it out makes it so much easier and gets you in deeper, it seems to me. <br/><br/>And I love the structure of jeep form so much--it feels better to me than straight larp since you get to watch what everyone else does. Which is often so funny! Or so tense and touching. Then everyone gets to see it and appreciate it, and also to be able to play off of one another based on it. The reincorporation is strong and funny (Civil war re-enactors!), because we are keyed in to what everyone else is doing. <br/><br/>It was 110% awesome to share this stuff with you all at Dreamation. I am so grateful to Tobias for coming out. And, my plan is to do more, in the western MA area as well as NYC, and wherever else I may be in the months to come!

And that's actively discouraged.  Or rather <i>resolving </i>conflicts - you want to build and build and then edit.  There's nothing wrong with that but I've been doing the opposite all my life at the RPG table.  So in jeepform you've got this framework with scenes, and clear ties to improv (callbacks, reincorporation, agreement, etc) that's also nailed the concept of telling a story with those tools.
