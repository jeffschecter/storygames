Lately I've been playing a lot of Burning Wheel, and its mechanics always seem to bring the focus back to the characters (which is intentional).  The state of the world mostly arises as an ad hoc thing, motivated by plot reasons.  The game is awesome, but there's something missing for me I keep trying to put my finger on.<br/><br/>I'm thinking a lot, lately, about "world state mechanics" and how they give players something concrete they can "reason" about.  For example, my current fantasy campaign has a regional map, but players rarely think too much about the route they will take to get somewhere.  If the map were labelled with obstacles (this long route is easy, this short route is treacherous), suddenly there's an unambiguous, shared model the players can reason about.  Once they decide to travel somewhere, the question of the route is immediately in their minds.<br/><br/>Same thing with resources in old school dungeon crawls - if you play by the book, players will sooner or later be confronted with decisions about whether to press on, or return to the keep to get more lantern oil, rations, or bandages.  These decisions don't necessarily emerge from the GM issuing a challenge, "You will soon be out of light," but are something the players learn must be taken into account, and do so on their own initiative.<br/><br/>I think the "missing thing" relates to player investment.  It's exciting when players become competent in the game world, they've learned something, but also there are emergent goals: players decide to save up to buy a barrel of lamp oil, or decide on their own initiative to make a known-to-be-risky foray into Vissertown to get new tires for their battered Humvee.  This is the wished-for moment I keep thinking of.<br/><br/>It also relates to verisimilitude.  When I played Wing Commander, I'd get these patrol missions - visit Waypoints A, B, and C, then return home.  Of course, every single time, there are enemies at each one, with the difficulty escalating to a nail-biting climax.  It was cinematic, exciting, but obviously contrived.  You never get ganked at waypoint A by a massive enemy patrol force, and find points B and C unoccupied.<br/><br/>When the world state is consistent enough, players have to take it into account unprompted. In that sense, it's a concern independent of the GM, it has achieved a life of its own.<br/><br/>My suspicion about the heavier weight older games is that they were <i>too</i> burdened by these concerns.  Detailed encumbrance, movement distance, fuel consumption, ammunition weight, etc. were fiddlier than they needed to be to get the desired effect, nor was the intended effect communicated by the rules.  (e.g. "This game is about players making tough decisions about whether to leave the bag of weapons behind.")  But, in playing an entirely character-focused campaign, where my GMing inventions are inspired by the characters' challenge, I'm starting to yearn for something concrete, something outside of my own creative spontaneity.<br/><br/>Does this make sense to anyone?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383445">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383445/#Comment_383445" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-26T12:24:12+00:00" title="June 26, 2012 12:24PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 26, 2012 12:31PM by Arpie.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry, but no. Creative spontaneity is part of what sells a gaming experience, even one where the players are presented with hardships and privations. In the old illusionist paradigm, it was central to being seen as a "good GM" and in the new paradigm, it's required, to some extent, in all the players (which is why the new paradigm kind of sucks for people who don't want to invest, who are more comfortable as what Robin Laws would call "casual" players.)<br/><br/>Without the opportunity for spontaneous new input, you have a boardgame. (Which is cool because, if you want, you can even be spontaneous when playing boardgames, but that spontaneity will have no or even negative impact on the game's strategic outcome.)<br/><br/>So, if you're looking for a challenge that models the "feel" of some of the old post-apoc, desperate-for-supplies RPGs (like Morrow Project or Twilight and,  to a far lesser extent, Gamma World) but you still want players to have a fairly open-end set of options (which, I'll remind you, the scenarios in Morrow Project, Twilight and Gamma World did not have, those modules were written with certain expected behaviors in mind - which is where the idea of going "off the rails" comes from) then what you might want to do is:<br/><br/>Make up some kind of rule that allows you to impose hardships as scores or goal levels that need to be reached.<br/>--for instance, have three or four different "dooms" that players face (in my ideal post-apoc game, the players would make each of these up.) Keep the number limited because a game like this is going to have a lot of emergent complications crop up really, really fast. Example dooms might be: Death from Dehydration, Abandoned by the Others, Forced into a Marriage with a Hideous Mutant, Crippled by Hyper-Cancer, Sold into Slavery (or Conscripted by the Holnists or whatever) - score levels/upper limits might be set by individual for customization or pre-set if the numbers you need to use demand it. You could have the team pick the set of dooms facing all members and then have each member assign their own characters' scores, putting each one closer or further from a particular doom as the players' tastes permit.  (Dana has a 3 in Poisoned by the Toxic Air, a 5 in Mistaken for a Commie and a 4 in Turned into a Cyborg while Chris has a 6 in Poisoned, a 3 in Mistaken and a 3 in Cyborgized)<br/>Let the players make decisions based off the information at hand (maps,  descriptions, facts created by other players, etc.)<br/>-- in this case, you might even want to go with some sort of "kicker" system, something where you use random tables to call something up (sorry if this is sounding a bit too much like Apocalypse World, but AW is really a great game - even if I hate bringing it up because I want to see people push beyond the greatness and make their own stuff.)  You could also do something where players get to add their own "possibilites" or "hopes" or "last bastions" of whatever during the initial scenario/team-creation process.<br/>Have decisions either add to scores, pushing them toward their final doom (in order to get immediate story benefits) or stave off that doom a little longer (in exchange for immediate, short-term suffering and humiliations.)<br/><br/>The formula you might want to keep in mind is: "In order to prevent..." [hardship] "...we need" [supply] "...which is likely to be found..." [location x] "...but..." [likely danger or complication at location x] - kickers (or, better yet, the imagination and analytical input of the players) make much better fill-in-the-blanks than GM Fiat.<br/><br/>What makes something a long-term decision needs to be influenced by the group's opinion in order to make something like this work, so you'd need a voting system of some kind (maybe each player rolling 2d6 beforehand, keeping one for themselves and giving one away to the action they think is "best" or most efficacious or whatever criteria you think would be appropriate for the story-type. Lowest score suffers penalty.)<br/><br/>Hey, actually, I think I'll use that idea for something!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB" title="PeterBB"><img alt="PeterBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB">PeterBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383456/#Comment_383456" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-26T14:46:59+00:00" title="June 26, 2012  2:46PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I completely disagree with Arpie. While I love my GM-less, character-driven games, other forms of play can be fun too. And I think there are a lot of interesting innovations going on right now that directly surround this idea.<br/><br/>One direction is the "old school" games. A lot of people have been going back to 1970s D&amp;D and trying to actually play by those rules. If you can find Luke's or Eero's accounts of their games, they're excellent. OD&amp;D (along with its various clones) is very lightweight, and I think lends itself pretty well to what you're talking about. (One underexplored area, in my opinion, is how to quickly and easily generate enough content for a persistent, sandboxy world, so that the GM doesn't have to spend weeks writing the setting. Kevin Crawford has been doing great stuff with this in <i>Stars Without Number</i>, <i>Red Tide</i>, and <i>An Echo, Resounding</i>.)<br/><br/>Another direction is <i>Apocalypse World</i> and its derivatives (<i>Dungeon World</i> comes to mind, with its old-school flavor). "Fronts" do a good job of making the world outside the players have a life of its own, and making maps is mandatory. <br/><br/>(For an interesting mix of the two styles, John Harper's <i>World of Dungeons</i> is pretty cool.)<br/><br/>Personally, I think we can expect to see even more innovations along these lines, which is pretty exciting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Onix" title="Onix"><img alt="Onix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/814/nLOXPRKOM00IG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Onix">Onix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383459/#Comment_383459" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-26T15:16:44+00:00" title="June 26, 2012  3:16PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like to play both the open ended and the mechanistic games.

I also disagree with the idea that a game must be played the way it's writers originally intended (a la gamma world, etc.) although I am occasionally befuddled by my players when they use my games in a way not intended, I have no problem when they do so.<br/><br/>Obviously a good many fine folks here are very keen on narrative games, but they are not 'true RPGs' any more or less than an old school RPG. They are not board games, and while there may be more restrictions on what a character can freely do, I actually find that to be more of a challenge than narrating what I want and getting it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383474">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy" title="Fuseboy"><img alt="Fuseboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/294/n454M25FRHU6K.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">Fuseboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383474/#Comment_383474" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-26T16:08:11+00:00" title="June 26, 2012  4:08PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Without the opportunity for spontaneous new input, you have a boardgame.</blockquote>\nYeah, I think you're talking about something else entirely, Arpie.  I'm not sure where you got the idea I'm going after eliminating creative spontaneity.  Let's put it another way.  In Burning Wheel, there are many elements of character state - abilities, injuries, equipment, etc. that are concrete.  The "system" encompasses these aspects of the character.<br/><br/>On the other hand, other than NPCs and what pokes through in terms of skill obstacles, the system doesn't address world state whatsoever; there's nothing quantified by the system about a campaign world in BW.  There are no 'level 3 kingdoms', empty hexes, "Large" armies, or anything like that.  As a result, the game tends to be about characters, with everything else up to the GM.  (Which is an asset, since this makes the game quite flexibly about everything.)  The one world state system I can think of is lifestyle maintenance tests.<br/><br/>Contrast with Mouse Guard, which has a system for seasons and weather that has very pointed mechanical consequences.  Players don't usually get the latitude to choose when they undertake their missions, but you can be that if they did, they'd certainly be weighing the consequences of making this or that important journey now, in Spring, or waiting until the calmer Summer weather.<br/><br/>So thanks, guys, you've helped me clarify what I'm on about.<br/><br/>I've seen Stars Without Number - it struck me as slightly over the top in terms of involving a lot of "GM solo play", but it's a great example.<br/><br/>I'm reminded of something I concluded about mystery games.  When there's ongoing mysterious activity, it tends to throw off clues - strange, incomprehensible events, perhaps, but when the facts become known it all makes sense.  With wholly spontaneous play, there's less of a sense of a truly concrete world out there.  Players needn't worry so much about scouting ahead because, dammit, it'll be exactly as dangerous as it needs to be for it to be fun.  The game makes a cool story, but the world is somehow spongier and more ephemeral.  When there's a real core, throwing off evidence, it tends to feel more real.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383533/#Comment_383533" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-27T00:27:22+00:00" title="June 27, 2012 12:27AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your observation makes perfect sense to me, Michael. You've struck on a decided weakness of Burning Wheel. It's so character focused, it can easily lose sight of the world. And I love a good world to explore.<br/><br/>In our long running game, we've painted the world on like coats of laquer. It starts thin, but we keep going over it until it becomes richly colored.

I've been thinking about similar things recently. And when I asked Vincent what was a game that he wanted to play but hasn't been made yet, he said "one where it matters how long it takes to load a musket" (paraphrased a bit). So yeah.<br/><br/>I think "resource management" is a good name for this, where the resources are explicitly physical or temporal and tied to the physical, biological, mechanical issues of the fiction. I would agree oldschool D&amp;D gets a lot of this right and is perhaps the best game in this vein, but it doesn't offer a lot in terms of tools - its qualities are largely emergent and can be easily glossed over. It fails gracefully so to speak (and that, plus other factors, gave the rise to "new school" D&amp;D).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy" title="Fuseboy"><img alt="Fuseboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/294/n454M25FRHU6K.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">Fuseboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383571/#Comment_383571" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-27T10:04:29+00:00" title="June 27, 2012 10:04AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the mistake that old school systems made was too many systems and too fiddly, and generally not explaining the motivation.  Tracking encumbrance by weight in coins.  Really?  It presents itself like an unwelcome accounting problem, when in fact it could be this neat, chunky system.  (WFRP 3e has a much coarser encumbrance system, though I think it serves the same purpose as Mouse Guard, preventing people from becoming walking hardware stores.)  So most of the time it gets immediately house ruled out, and a neat effect of the game is dropped without even realizing it.  I my decades of playing D&amp;D, I'm not sure I ever tracked encumbrance - not until PCGen came out.<br/><br/>Luke, I think there's much to be said for lacquer. The world builds up a narrative coherency: my players fret about who controls the Giragita, and whether Wealdine will become the next tyrant on their own initiative.  It sounds like your Si Juk world, reasoning about the remnants of political movements has become second nature to the players.<br/><br/>The "thin layers" approach is extremely flexible, because each game can be about something different, but there's something powerful about saying, "Bam! This game is about seasons and weather, pay attention!"<br/><br/>I wonder if it could work with optional systems.  As in .. here's regular resources, but in <i>this</i> campaign, we're going to use the detailed rules for tracking lifestyle maintenance obstacles for your hirelings and property holdings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383590/#Comment_383590" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-27T12:33:19+00:00" title="June 27, 2012 12:33PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, I think "weight in gold pieces" makes a huge amount of sense, at least in Moldvay (which I'm familiar with).
