This looks really cool, Marcus! The text is very clear and the game looks interesting.<br><br>One question: How are influence points used? I'm a bit skeptical of "Earn a point to get yourself in trouble" mechanics, as they often just lead to "Spend a point to get yourself out of it", making it a tiny feedback loop of Czege principle violations.<br><br>I really love the virtues, and the open ended questions followed by "impressions" are pure genius. It'd be interesting to see how the fate points work out in play. Are there any AP reports of this game to look at?                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221579">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MJGraham" title="MJGraham"><img alt="MJGraham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nEPVXFCEJAK2O.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MJGraham">MJGraham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221579/#Comment_221579" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-30T04:50:22+00:00" title="July 30, 2009  4:50AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 30, 2009 4:51AM by MJGraham.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Influence points are used to draw more beads during challenges. Players typically draw three beads to determine the result of a challenge. Players can use influence to draw up to five beads and then choose the three beads they want to use. While play testing I noticed that players easily separated their own interests from their characters interests, and I've witnessed on more than one occasion players earning influence by getting their characters into trouble and then spending influence to either keep them in trouble or make matters worse.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see virtues as a way of seeing why a character does something rather than how they do it. I'm also interested in the idea of people who are seething with anger, bitterness and resentment being selfless and heroic precisely because they were so angry, bitter and resentful. They kind of have to be insurrectionists because of who they are as people.<br/>\n<br/>\nFate worked better than I hoped. Players loved being in control of how and when their insurrectionists got removed from the story. And knowing that it was an inevitable part of the story created a sense of tragedy that helped the players get something more immediate from the relationship they had with their insurrectionists. I think players often have the feeling that death probably won't happen to their characters, that they'll roll well enough, someone else will save them, or the GM won't allow it. But when character death (or elimination) becomes an inevitable outcome rather than a possible outcome, players tend to invest more time into really getting to know their characters much sooner.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's a play report <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=441062" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I'm not very experienced at writing play reports and its unfinished because I didn't have enough spare time and  I've kind of forgotten a lot of the details.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221582/#Comment_221582" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-30T05:04:08+00:00" title="July 30, 2009  5:04AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I played your game, I might hack the "Get a point to put yourself into trouble" to be more akin to compels: "You get a point if you punch her in the face because of your anger."

The compel would have to fit in with their insurrectionists attitude statements. Also the player narrator offering the compel would gain influence points if the compel fits in with their insurrectionists impression of the other player narrator's insurrectionist.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
