I have also stolen spolight characters, and spolights will be the only ones who can give out points for stuff they personally like.<br/><br/>So the issue now is coming up with triggers (a la TSOY Keys). I had the "my trait gets in the way" but had forgotten my idea for the other one, which was, "I help you by pointing out your trait in my RP."

It's along the lines of <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1356" rel="nofollow">X's attribute Y and how I feel about it</a>. Part of the initial phase of the game is, cooperatively, making sure that every character is thoroughly enmeshed (the parallel with situation engineering).<br/><br/>The carrot for this is that whenever an entity your character is enmeshed with comes up in a scene, you get 1 XP. If the specific attribute comes up, you get 2 XP, and if the attribute is set up to be potentially changed by a conflict, you get 5 XP (like Keys). <br/><br/>You can also use your enmeshment to get rerolls (or give them to other people) in conflicts where they'd be relevant.<br/><br/>Finally, each enmeshment has an associated goal or dilemma, which again is like a Key. You get XP for trying to resolve it and failing, and for finally resolving it.<br/><br/>The format goes something like:<br/><br/>"I feel <b>jealous</b> towards <b>Jim</b> because of <b>his popularity</b>. Goal: <b>Make Jim look bad in public while I look good</b>."<br/><br/>I'm tinkering with rules where Jim can refuse to admit to your character's perception that he's popular and that can go back and forth as well, eventually resolving as either "Your character is imagining it", "Jim is in denial" or "Your character got over it without the issue ever having been settled".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74285/#Comment_74285" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-07T14:42:08+00:00" title="June  7, 2007  2:42PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neat, Mike.

I thought the concept of scrips was very interesting.  <br/>Having never played or read the game and only basing it on the interview information, I had one thought.  Wouldn't the repeated use of short-hand descriptors pigeon-hole the PCs from a character-development angle?  How do the characters grow if the other players constantly re-inforce and recognize the same part(s) of the character?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_74423">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74423/#Comment_74423" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-08T09:42:10+00:00" title="June  8, 2007  9:42AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 8, 2007 9:44AM by Josh Roby.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Two answers, Rich:<br/><br/>a) When you just start out using scrips, most of the passes are, as you say, "short-hand desciptors [that] pigeon-hole the PCs."  My set of convention characters has a Patriot, and so players are always shouting "For Queen and Country!  For Queen and Country!" and passing scrips to the Patriot.  <em>However</em>, once you get into the game and start really developing the characters, the references that accompany passes get less obvious, less reductive, and more textured.  Which means it's hard to describe it in a single line in this thread -- but if the PCs had uncovered some atrocity commited by British troops, the scrip might get passed to the Patriot to accompany nothing more than a signficant look.<br/><br/>b) You have three thematic batteries and you can swap one out between each situation.  Or more, if you really want.  So if one is getting old or just not working for you anymore, it's time to find a new facet of your character.<br/><br/>Okay, three answers:<br/><br/>The thing about scrips is that they don't just continually bring up already established facts about characters.  After the characters are established, scrips work both to reinforce what's already there but also to challenge what's been established and cast those things in new light.  They end up working like in <em>Dogs</em>, where the GM is always asking, "You believe that?  What about now?  What about in this situation?  What about when this is on the line?"  Because thematic batteries are so short -- a word or a phrase -- they are continually open to interpretation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74622/#Comment_74622" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-08T20:19:15+00:00" title="June  8, 2007  8:19PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tim Gray</cite>I think, though, there's an issue of game designer jargon spiral, and maybe the final version should have its terminology ratcheted back down toward general reader level.</blockquote>\nIs that directed to me or to Josh, Tim?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
