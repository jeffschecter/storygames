I'm going to be going to Origins Game Fair in Columbus again this year as a member of the press, but want a better idea of what I am going to be doing while I'm there. Does anyone have any suggestions as to what kinds of articles they'd like to see coming out of this convention? Going to GenCon isn't an option for me at this point, so other than our local CharCon, this will be it convention-wise for me.<br/><br/>So what kinda stuff would you like to see, either in the newspaper or online?<br/><br/>ME                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209896/#Comment_209896" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-01T15:35:21+00:00" title="June  1, 2009  3:35PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Who are you writing for?

I assume you mean you're writing on your blog, rather than working for a local newspaper or something, right?<br/><br/>If LJ/Blog, I'd say the most important thing would be to visit the Khepera Publishing booth and write a lot about the Maid RPG.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>OK, btu for real, here's the main things I like to read in a con report:<br/>* What games are new? RPGs, Board Games, Card Games, etc.<br/>* What did you (personally) find cool?<br/>* Attend some big events. There are at least a dozen open/big-looking events. Describe some of them. Take pictures.<br/>* Take lots of pictures.<br/><br/>Personally, I'm not as much into interviews. It's all TL;DR unless the interviewee is a friend. But I love to hear a journaled voice as one goes through the con, talks about what he found cool, what he did, etc. Small vignettes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209988/#Comment_209988" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-02T07:45:52+00:00" title="June  2, 2009  7:45AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You might try going to the retailer lounge. game store people and game company people meet there. <br/>\n<br/>\nChris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209990/#Comment_209990" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-02T07:49:39+00:00" title="June  2, 2009  7:49AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, I write for The Parkersburg News &amp; Sentinel, plus several online sites like GameCryer, Flames Rising and CharCon.org (our local convention). For the newspaper I do a preview article to let people know what is going on, then a wrapup article from the convention, which usually runs the Saturday of the convention.<br/><br/>For Flames Rising last year I did a horror-roundup from the convention, and then a couple of articles on specific games, like Zombie Fluxx. <br/><br/>I am looking to put more on my blog as well, though.<br/><br/>Appeciate the feedback so far.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209994/#Comment_209994" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-02T07:58:40+00:00" title="June  2, 2009  7:58AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Last year I also did a column "Why you should take your kids to Origins" for the newspaper. I will be doing something similar this year for Mid-Ohio Valley Parent Magazine's web site.<br/><br/>The main problem I had was all of the material I got at the convention that I didn't do anything with. It was either lost, forgotten, ignored or I just didn't know where it fit. I'd like to be more focused in my approach, but at the same time produce more material this year. That may be biting off more than I can chew, I don't know.<br/><br/>Oh, and Andy, Maid is definitely on my list. I am thinking of doing a "Games I'm Digging" update, maybe a couple of times each day, just mentioning and posting pics of games that catch my attention and I think are cool. I likely would do that as a combo of LJ posts and Twitter updates.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
