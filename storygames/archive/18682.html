Exciting times! One of these was particularly intriguing, an adventure of sorts by Vincent Baker. <i>Seclusium of Orphone of the Three Visions</i> is the name. It's not actually an adventure module, despite some gestulation in that direction, but rather more of a procedure for creating adventure locations with random tables.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.lotfp.com/store/index.php?route=product/product&amp;product_id=171" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://www.purplepawn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/The-Seclusium-of-Orphone.jpg"/></a>Now, my opinion on the matter is totally premature, and not at all critique-grade - I just read the book yesterday, and got the idea I'm going to present below today. That being said, here's what I thought of the Seclusium: it's basically a waste of money for anybody looking for a D&amp;D adventure, and not very good as an array of random tables. When considering it as an adventure, I find that it fails horribly by not doing the actual legwork of D&amp;D adventure creation; a thing without determined maps, monsters or treasure is just a bunch of ideas, not an adventure. The greatest failing of all is how lax the problem-solving set-up in the ready-made adventure locations is, they mostly seem to offer very little in the way of danger or reward. When considered as a procedural random generation tool the book fares a little better, but frankly Matt Finch's <i>Tome of Adventure Design</i> is much superior in this regard, just to pick an example of what the baseline in the genre is like. The writing is of the fine quality we've come to expect of Vincent, but the organization of the book (and the weird notions Vincent offers about what things are important to randomize about an adventure location) makes using it unnecessarily burdensome. All in all I simply find that apparently either I don't grog what's to like here, or Vincent doesn't write a very useful OSR book.<br/><br/>All that being said, Seclusium is not entirely devoid of virtue: I find the central conceit to be interesting. The core idea of the book (aside from the ample Vancian aesthetics) is basically that a wizard's living space in D&amp;D could and should be interpreted more as a manor house than the traditional "wizard's tower": give your wizard an entire island or other secluded place, and treat the grounds of it as a smallest-scale wilderness crawl. Spread the wizard's habitation over a couple hectares of gardens, perhaps, and scatter interesting locations like small sanctums, servant quarters, zoos, specialized laboratories, flawed experiments and whatever else around the place. This is different from the traditional dungeon-based structure, as a manor-house arrangement presents the players with a much, much greater degree of initial freedom in choosing which minor locations around the grounds they'll explore. It's a fine set-up for a scattering of strange special encounters, perhaps some random encounters while the party wastes time, and even small dungeon-like locations within larger buildings or expanding under the ground.<br/><br/>I suspect that I'd have a more positive initial opinion of the book if the random tables were presented up front, and the sad sample scenarios were left out entirely. I suspect that the actual random tables are not bad enough to not be used, even if I don't feel any major creative need to delve into making up seclusia right now. Were I making a book about this sort of topic, though, I'd leave out the random tables for the type of stucco the wizard used in his walls and instead focus on providing e.g. map geomorphs, random treasure tables and various sorts of hazards that are appropriate for seclusia of the Vancian tradition.<br/><br/>(I think it's obvious to Jim and Vincent that I bear no malice in laying out my opinion here. I say this because the random reader might not know of our prior relationship, and might read the above in some sort of angry or spiteful tone. Win some, lose some, all projects can't be winners - and besides, it's well possible that my initial impression is not the word of Truth that I like to pretend it to be. And anyway, the point of this posting wasn't the above, that's just background for my Idea.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419540/#Comment_419540" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-04T04:46:57+00:00" title="August  4, 2013  4:46AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>The Idea I had today</b><br/><br/>Mulling over Seclusium (and complaining about it to Jim), I came to compare it to what had heretofore been the nadir of the LotFP publishing history, the <i>Isle of the Unknown</i> by Geoffrey McKinney.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.lotfp.com/RPG/products/isle-of-the-unknown" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VSdLpwPf6r0/T-8kYuwlCSI/AAAAAAAAA_4/IkOkPgDYmt8/s200/isle+of+the+unknown+cover.png"/></a>For those who aren't familiar with the product, the Isle is basically an elaborate hexcrawl island teeming in arbitrarily fantastical beasts yet without overarching themes, adventures, interesting local color or even random encounter tables; it's just a map with some settlements and a humongous list of special encounters, one per hex, the vast majority of them not actually interesting. I can't imagine that I'm the only one who's been trying to figure out what to do with this thing: it's sort of usable if you for some reason need somebody else to put down some not-particularly-interesting geography, and the encounters it provides work as a backdrop if you only had something to have them be a backdrop <i>for</i>.<br/><br/>Now, the biggest (and practically only) thing the Isle has going for it in the creative department is that it has a sort of classical mediterranean feel to it - many people find that it reminds vaguely of Homeric epics, especially Odyssey. That, and the magicians: the Isle is home to a bunch (like, a score) of pretty high-level magicians with eldritch powers in the classical vein. Think Circe, that sort of thing. The book specifies where these live and what their themes are (there are shepherd magicians, water magicians, etc. there), but nothing about their motivations or possible roles in adventures or such. Much speculation of how the Isle might be used in practical D&amp;D center on whether one might craft some sort of magical plottery soap opera game of thrones sort of thingy with these wizardly types. They even have pretty portraits in the book (as Jim likes to do, the Isle is a very pretty book, full-color and all), so they just need characterization and motives and some actual adventure locations to fight over.<br/><br/>OK, I think you can see where this is going: enter Seclusium, a book that can sort of be used as inspiration in creating wizardly seclusia with Vancian color (which, as we know, is 30% Victorian pettifoggery, 30% classical epic stylings, 30% pulp fantasy and 10% Colonel's secret sauce). Seclusium might be ass when you look at it from a boots-on-the-ground, have-to-have-an-adventure-for-todays-session perspective, but how about if one were to use it as the central backbone for an Isle of the Unknown campaign? Think about it:\n<ul><li>Vincent's book doesn't provide much in the way of tactical detail for creating an adventure location, but it does have pretty plentiful ideas for naming and motivating powerful wizards with esoteric interests. The seclusia created with this book have political and social features, and the wizards involved have complex magical motivations. All this means that if we scatter a bunch of seclusia around the Isle of the Unknown, it'll make perfect sense: the Island already has a bunch of pretty high-level wizards, so if we presume that Vincent's 7-step typology of wizardly headquarters holds true, then of course some of these wizard seclusia are in the "fifth stage", ready to be invaded by adventurers.</li><li>The book can obviously be used to give names, titles and natures for the pre-existing magicians of the Isle, too, although I also like the idea of giving them a slightly more classical tone in comparison with the seclusia material. Perhaps the Isle magicians are the "young turks" of the Isle's magical society, while the Seclusium material represents the detached, otherworldly concerns of the old guard. Whatever the exact details, it seems to me that these two books fit stylistically like hand and glove: the Isle is full of magical statuery and weird chimeric beasts, which are both very obvious elements of the sort of fantasy Seclusium proffers.</li><li>Adding half a dozen big, important seclusia on the Isle of the Unknown solves about half of the problems in running the Isle as a campaign, by providing strategic arcs: now all the magicians on the Isle can have motivations relating to looting or protecting old seclusia, which makes them natural patrons or enemies of an adventuring party. Relationship maps defining who was the old apprentice or lover to whom is definitely in order, and the referee might also develop some seclusium-like material about the living, awake wizards - the Isle book doesn't dwell on the details of their lifestyle that much, so some of them well might have seclusia of their own.</li><li>Admittedly Seclusium does nothing to provide the ground-level detail of wilderness encounters, economic detail, rumours and more ordinary adventure hooks and locations that you also need for a sandbox adventure, but perhaps those might be stolen from somewhere else. I'd say that if Seclusium manages to answer the strategic, long-term campaign arc part of the equation, then that's already a giant step closer to making the Isle usable, compared to where I was before.</li></ul>\nBrilliant, isn't it? Take two of the least useful Raggi publications, combine them, and I'd say you're pretty close to something as awesome as <i>Carcosa</i> or <i>Vornheim</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419541/#Comment_419541" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-04T05:28:02+00:00" title="August  4, 2013  5:28AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a good idea.<br/><br/>My main problem with <i>Isle of the Unknown</i> is as you pointed out: the wizards have zero personality.

The color, the aesthetic details, are the big stumbling block for me; if I'm going to just reinterpret the Isle completely, so that I can't use the monster descriptions and the statue descriptions and the portraits of the magicians, there's not really that much left to utilize there. Of course some people apparently use Carcosa as a framework for Gygaxian fantasy games, replacing the space aliens and whatnot with orcs, so apparently some find that sort of thing useful.<br/><br/>Hmm. I could see using Carcosa and the Isle as a lurid dual-worlds setting, in the vein of <i>Dark Seed</i> or <i>Talisman</i> or <i>Merchant Princes</i>: the Isle is this pleasant and richly coloured fantasy world of princesses and knights, but the campaign revolves around a shadowy cabal with the means to create portals to Carcosa of all places. (This could be an array of special spells and magic-items, mechanically: e.g. <i>Portal to Carcosa</i>, a 3rd level magic-user spell that opens a human-usable portal for a Turn.) The cabal would seek to rule the Isle with this power: Carcosan technology, and the ability to "teleport" anywhere by crossing the distance in the other world. A central conceit here would be a hex-by-hex correspondence between the two hex maps: characters could divine what is in the "other world" in a given spot by magical means, and any travel between the two worlds would lead to the corresponding hex, whether land or sea. Presumably adventurers would sooner or later discover the Carcosan situation and perhaps become heroes of two worlds!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419543/#Comment_419543" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-04T06:06:04+00:00" title="August  4, 2013  6:06AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My game was set on a plateau just north of a major port city, so I used the city on the Isle as reference, changed which direction was north, and synched everything up that way.

It is ultimately not very important what D&amp;D NPCs are like as personalities, which is mostly what the zodiac may give you. What the NPC wants concretely is more important, as that determines such important things as whether they might be an antagonist or patron for the adventurers. Essentially: if everything we know about a NPC is that they're a Taurus, and therefore faithful and determined, that's just not that useful. I'd rather know that they're working on awakening a nearby volcano for nefarious purposes, or that they're a member of the Harpers, or whatever.<br/><br/>As a counter-example, consider that level of <i>Darkness Beneath</i> where there's a giant underground cave with its own underdark ecosystem, and then there are the two necromancers in there. The necromancers hate each other, for one used to be the other's apprentice in the past, before betraying his master. That's useful, because when one of these necromancers comes up in a random encounter, they can e.g. hire the adventuring party to steal something from the other necromancer. The NPC has something to offer to the game, in other words.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419553/#Comment_419553" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-04T11:51:23+00:00" title="August  4, 2013 11:51AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 4, 2013 11:52AM by Paul_T.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Exactly right, Eero. Vague personality traits (such as found in astrology, especially) can be next-to-useless for NPC play. What we need to know is what these people want and how they're able to go about getting it. Their motives and their resources. I'd much rather know that the King wants to divorce his Queen and have her beheaded, but the head of the Church opposes, than to learn a laundry list of "personality traits" for him, which, while useful perhaps for in-character portrayal, don't give us anything to actually drive play.<br/><br/>Does Seclusium give us that kind of thing? (Being Vincent's work, I'd expect it to do that well... but who knows.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419554/#Comment_419554" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-04T12:07:39+00:00" title="August  4, 2013 12:07PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, I think anything that gives your imagination a springboard is good. I mean, you can grab characterization from pretty much anywhere, the zodiac signs are just one. I can decide this wizard is like Taurus, look it up and say, okay, he's a hedonist, he collects precious shiny things from all over, likes good food, good wine, and hot sex. And he's willing to reward adventurers lavishly if they bring him specific items that he craves which have been lost to civilization (because, hey, he has so many of these golden coins but they all look the same). Bam, done. That took approximately one minute. I dunno how much game play I can get out of it, but at least it lets me use (some of) the material in Isle of the Unknown now.<br/><br/>My criticism of the book is that anything like this isn't in it, so I can't just do the imagining <i>while I'm reading it</i>. Instead, I have to go away and look stuff up and make plans. Combining books is kind of similar. It puts stuff I thought I couldn't use into a different context, making unusable material usable. It also magnifies the complexity of the setting and then the pattern-recognition parts of my brain go to work and it's not long before I have a setting that feels full and rich and complicated. Or more so than any one book on its own provides.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Isaac" title="Isaac"><img alt="Isaac" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Isaac">Isaac</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419667/#Comment_419667" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-06T17:24:09+00:00" title="August  6, 2013  5:24PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>My criticism of the book is that anything like this isn't in it, so I can't just do the imagining <i>while I'm reading it</i>.

But I keep contrasting my experience reading this with my read of Torchbearer. Torchbearer also has a lot of random tables. But the average table in Torchbearer sparked a lot more ideas, mostly because they were more likely to have fictional and mechanical consequences. <br/><br/>It grabs the imagination to enter a town, roll a couple of times, and discover that a building has burned down or the town is under siege. On the other hand, discovering that a Seclusium is built out of brightly polished jumbled stone adds to the atmosphere but it's less dense. Doesn't grab me by the throat. Each individual item is less meaningful and more generic, which is an odd thing to say about something so Vancian.<br/><br/>Maybe part of this is the layout. A bunch of the random tables have short little entries that combine together. In the book this is laid out in long lists, but if there is enough space on a page I think it'd have been better suited to putting them in an actual table, so you can quickly scan it and get a feel for the results. The people-and-creature charts in particular would read better this way. <br/><br/>The odd juxtaposition created by combining several random elements does help with the Jack Vance feel. And some of the tables are really evocative. But for every brilliant "5. Have been reft of individual identity. Instead they all answer to a single name, 'Armonter,' in unity of action and experience..." there's a "14. Wrinkled face." <br/><br/>There's a lot of "Or another of your own creation" notes. While it's nice that hackability is explicit, the overall feel is tentative, like it's not comfortable in its own skin. Some of the charts seem to peter out of ideas.<br/><br/>I can't really recommend it as an example of random generation. Part of this is my personal weaknesses as a GM. The problem I always struggle with in making a dungeon-ish location is to come up with a good unifying idea behind the thing. Seclusium has one really grand idea, the Seclusium itself, but I'm not sure yet if it'll be able--on its own--to give me the ideas for a bunch of differentiated Seclusiums. (My other problem is placing enough treasure in Dungeon World.)<br/><br/>Contrast with something like the Blackmoore sparker for Dungeon World; where the table of rumors has a large mechanical and frictional effect in a small space and includes an a mechanic for escalating the results. Very dense, very specific, and has a system incorporated in it that gives each subsequent result even more meaning. Or, heck, the Oracles from In A Wicked Age, which evoke immediate throat-grabbing imagery, and set a specific but unique stage.<br/><br/>I'm probably going to use Seclusium the next time I need a wizard's abode around; I like Jack Vance and random tables enough that I can mine it for useful ideas. I think the suggestion to combine it with something else is a useful one; that'll shore up the overlap in weaknesses between my GM skills and the book's gaps. It, and this discussion, have started me musing on what aspects a random-generation content system needs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419670/#Comment_419670" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-06T18:40:44+00:00" title="August  6, 2013  6:40PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's my criticism of Isle of the Unknown.

I misread that as a criticism of both. I have to say that my reaction to Seclusium as I was reading it did consist of me pausing to figure out where things fit. Combining two separate things like this strikes me as an effective way to give context to things that otherwise lack it. In fact, context may be the glue I'm missing for Seclusium; I don't currently have a game running where one would fit. Once I have one I'll have to revisit it and see if my opinion changes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
