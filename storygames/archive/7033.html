I read the DMG and ran a few skill challenges this weekend and there was a bit of confusion.<br/><br/>At first skill challenges seem easy to run. But the instructions are vague and seem to be missing quite a bit of needed information. Reading the examples of all the skill challenges only confuses the matter as option are used in the examples that are not included in the rules.<br/><br/>In the examples, sometimes:<br/><br/>- using a certain skill, intimidate for example, is an automatic failure, no roll required<br/>- using a certain skill will reveal which skills are automatically failures<br/>- you can use any primary skill included in the skill challenge<br/>- you must use the primary skills in a specific order<br/>- you may use supplementary skills whenever you want<br/>- only certain skills may be aided with supplementary skills<br/>- supplementary skills give you a +2 if you succeed to your primary skill<br/>- supplementary skills give you a +2 if you succeed to your primary skill and count as a success towards winning the skill challenge<br/>- supplementary skills have no penalty for failure<br/>- supplementary skills give you a -2 if you fail to your primary skill<br/>- supplementary skills give you a -2 if you fail to your primary skill and count as a failure towards losing the skill challenge<br/>- the number of primary skills available seems to be random<br/><br/>In general, there are no rules or even guidelines that govern any of the above.So we decided to stick to the 7 examples in the book rather than create our own. <br/><br/>Additionally to the above confusion, we also ran into the math problems detailed in other 4E threads (even with extensive use of +2 for good ideas and aid skills, when permitted). Roughly we failed 5 out of the 7 skill challenges. Additionally, consequences for failing a skill challenge were very vague. They potentially make future encounters harder but it's not clear how and how far to go (make the next encounter level 1 level higher?).<br/><br/>Has anyone else run into these issues?<br/>How did you resolve them?<br/>How do you run skill challenges?<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>John                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156416/#Comment_156416" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-14T09:25:46+00:00" title="July 14, 2008  9:25AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As I recall, Skill Challenges are not really set up to be run on the fly, you're supposed to set them up like you would a combat encounter.  So just like its your choice to set the flaming pit in the middle of the room, its your choice what the effects the individual skill checks have.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo a fully written up Skill Challenge is meant to look like those examples.  Here are the skills you can use.  Here are the special effects of certain skills if players think of using them.  Here's a skill players can use to learn what those effects are.  You pretty much map those out in advance however it makes sense to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't have my book with me, but as I recall there are some broad guidelines for the sorts of things you can do.  Its not called out but rather buried in the text that your eye slips past when you're looking for a header or other flag.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_156418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156418/#Comment_156418" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-14T09:30:44+00:00" title="July 14, 2008  9:30AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wrote a post on <a href="http://mightyatom.blogspot.com/2008/06/d-4e-how-im-doing-skill-challenges.html" rel="nofollow">how I'm running skill challenges</a>.

Spoilers!<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style="color:white">A PC decided he didn't like Padraig because he turned a blind eye to the cultists.  When the PCs discovered evidence of cult activity in Winterhaven off the body of Irontooth, they confronted Padraig.  I decided that he had been contacted by Kalarel, who told him to keep his nose out of Orcus's business, and paid him off.  He wasn't the spy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo anyways, the PCs confront him with the note, and Padraig burns it.  Combat starts, ends shorty with Padraig dead.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had Rond jump in once the combat was over.  He was going to arrest the PCs.  They started making skill checks.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout half-way through, I decided it was a skill challenge.  I did not declare it was a skill challenge.  The goal was to stay on the good side of the law.<br/>\n<br/>\nI ad-libbed the DCs, using the suggested ones on page 42 - without the +5.  They made 4 successes, one of which was a Make Whole ritual (may have asked for an Arcana check?).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end, it played out much like normal skill checks, though I knew it would end after 4 successes or 2 failures, and what the outcome would resolve.

But you also need to consider powers. My fighter's Covering Attack isn't going to be any good at convincing the King to give us soldiers. All I should have are skills.  So, you'd either make an elaborate system, that's like combat, but with powers based on various skills (maybe training in it gives you 2, and then each Skill Focus feat gives you 1 more) to let you do more damage or other special things.  Or you have to simplify combat way down, and make it interesting by translating what hits and damage mean (such as in terms of existing Skill Challenge successes and failures).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156485">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156485/#Comment_156485" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-14T13:36:50+00:00" title="July 14, 2008  1:36PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can't get there from here for the link (EnWorld is prohibited, Story Games is not, go figure), but I will use Stalker0's Skill Challenge hack.

You can use them in just about any order, unless you program in certain triggers (like you need to use Insight to uncover that the baron is fond of religious proverbs, allowing Religion to be used to help charm him).<br><br>You are over-thinking skill challenges. Take a look at the section on creating your own skill challenges.  You are making a lot of assumptions that just aren't there, but you are extrapolating them from the examples instead.  All the variety in the examples are just that. The variety and potential. It's not really your fault, the lack of good examples of process is a systematic problem in the core set.\n<blockquote>Additionally, consequences for failing a skill challenge were very vague.</blockquote>\nAnd they should be (although again, some better examples and duscussion would have been welcome)!  Because the rulebook can't pretend to know the variety of skill challenges that you will use.  If you fail to convince the baron's wife that he's a dragon in disguise, what does that mean? It's up to your story and the player's actions. You can either plan for it as something that happens automatically - if it fails, she tells the baron and he attacks them in the night, or she defends her husband but then sneaks into his study to find out the truth and is discovered and then imprisoned (needing to be rescued), or something else?  Or you can let the players direct things and simply give them conditions of failure. Like tell them the only way to get her away from the dragon is to kidnap her, or since they didn't convince the baroness, her loyal household guard won't be able to help you if you attack the baron anyway, etc.<br><br>The main rule of thumb is do not completely shut down any paths that stops the story from continuing. If they fail trying to get a clue trough the skill challenge, have a condition of that failure be a tough combat that<i> gives </i>them the clue when they win (this combat could flow right out of the challenge, or days after, whatever you need). You can even make them like stakes setting. Perhaps they get the clue no matter what, but failing means they did it in a way that they've made enemies.<br><br>Or look at it this way, since skill challenges (at default DCs) are heavily stacked against PCs without careful and skilled skill use, so plan for them as assumed complications resulting from the failure. Skill Challenges are the events in the story that makes things irrevocably worse for the protagonists. Like opening their hand to the baroness and having it slapped away.  The challenge to the PCs is to<i> make their fate better</i>.  If they fail, then the horrible stuff is already going to happen as ordained.  If they succeed, then it's better for them.  Maybe they avoid a potentialy deadly encounter (and<i> know </i>they avoided it), gain some help, or catch their enemies unawares.<br><br>Also, John's method highlights some great tricks that the text really should have flashing arrows pointed to it and be in the book.  The complexity of success and failures is a great tool to put in shades of gray other than win/lose.  If you want some quantitative results, use these.  An example: for each failure, there's an extra goblin in the next fight (or the boss is increased by a level). Each success should also do something, perhaps turning one goblin into three minions, or reducing the boss's level by one for every two successes.  Or they could be story triggers. Like one success means that, whether or not the king is swayed, one of the servants is swayed; two successes and it's a guard; three and it's a noble; all four successes and it's the king (duh).<br><br>But specifically how bad or good things get as a result from failure or success is up to you and the fiction of the current story.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson" title="Chris Peterson"><img alt="Chris Peterson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cpeterso.com/html/img/merman-confounded.200x200.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson">Chris Peterson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156510/#Comment_156510" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-14T15:10:39+00:00" title="July 14, 2008  3:10PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For all the effort the DMG puts into Skill Challenges, it seems like Burning Wheel's Linked Tests (i.e. multiple skill checks with cascading bonuses) would be much simpler for similar effect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_156513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156513/#Comment_156513" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-14T15:17:30+00:00" title="July 14, 2008  3:17PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 14, 2008 4:46PM by John_Harper.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We had a really pivotal skill challenge as the second encounter of the last adventure.<br><br>The group needed to investigate the Cult of Vecna in the city. We hadn't done anything in the city yet, and it was just a big blank slate. I knew this would turn into everyone hemming and hawing over what to do, without any hand holds (and no Circles rolls!). So, I called a skill challenge. Each round would be a day of investigation. Roll initiative, go!<br><br>I set out the Moderate difficulty skills (Streetwise, Insight, Religion). On each player's turn, I asked them to say what skill they wanted to use (one of the Moderates or one of their choice, at Hard). Then I framed really hard into a scene:<br/><br/>Ryan: "I want to use my Streetwise."<br/>John: "Okay. How are you gonna use it?"<br/>Ryan: "I'm a fighter. I know people in, like, a city watch or something."<br/>John: "The Winterguard. Yeah. You know a captain of the watch, Viraka. You're in her office. She's all, 'Kalil! You bastard, where have you been these days? Ready to come work for me yet?'"<br/>Ryan: "Uh... well, I have a job. But I might be able to help you out if you help me out."<br/>Viraka: "Hrm. Fine. I may have something for you. The Council is telling us to look the other way with these nobles who are up to no good. They're into some kind of cult or something. I need to shut 'em down, but it can't look like the Guard did it. You up for that?"<br/><br/>And so on. Each player had their little scene (about 2 mins), their skill roll, and the attack roll of the challenge (which was the cult trying to mess with them -- in one case it was an actual ambush). By the time we went around the group a couple times, we had fleshed out NPCs and factions of the city and created all kinds of fodder for future stories.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156523/#Comment_156523" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-14T16:23:59+00:00" title="July 14, 2008  4:23PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Alvin,<br/><br/>I suspect that you are misreading my post (or my post should have been clearer) as you and I are saying very much the same things. Note, prior to my points, I stated "In the examples, sometimes:". I'm not making absolute rule statements. I'm only stating that the examples showcase rules interpretations that are not clear or absent from the rules themselves. Given that the math behind skill challenges is off (an accepted truth on Enworld and by employees at Wizards) and the rules are not clear, there may be unspoken assumptions (hinted at by the examples) that if explained clearly, would solve many of the problems. Thus I'm asking how other people are handling skill challenges. Especially since many people having success are also altering aspects of the rules. <br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>John                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_156524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156524/#Comment_156524" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-14T16:24:34+00:00" title="July 14, 2008  4:24PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>We had a really pivotal skill challenge as the second encounter of the last adventure.</blockquote>\nHot!!!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156535/#Comment_156535" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-14T17:28:00+00:00" title="July 14, 2008  5:28PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gotcha John.

Smaller goals are achieved or not within a larger framework. It really generates a lot of world material, and makes each roll important, as well as giving lots of space to roleplay and improvise.<br><br/>I admit, though, I'm pretty hippy when it comes to what skills people can use for a Skill Challenge. I pretty much let the players set out how they're going to approach a problem, and rule from their initial choices of skills what constitutes a reasonable contribution. I also encourage lots of helping rolls. Helping rolls, especially when everyone at the table piles bonuses on to one player, really build up a scene's details and, as a result, the tension of the final roll.<br/><br/>However, I don't understand what you mean by 'the attack roll fo the challenge'. In the course of a normal skill challenge, especially using Stalker0's modified rules, there seems to be enough failure to create a sense of forboding. What does the attack roll do?
