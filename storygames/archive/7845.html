A pistol is a handcrossbow, a longbow a rifle. Hit Points are Morale. I would just use the Martial based classes with the exception of the Cleric and maybe the Wizard (a specialist of some sort). A Warlord is an officer, Rangers and Rogues are spec. ops guys. A fighter is a grizzled sgt. A cleric is the medic. A paladin is the crazy cowboy guy in every war movie. It is entirely doable, but the trick is getting everyone to buy into the reskinning.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174169/#Comment_174169" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-08T13:24:38+00:00" title="October  8, 2008  1:24PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Reskinning will only get you so far I think (if everyone is going to buy into the reskinning chances are you can get everyone to buy into Dnd 4th as is) <br/>\n<br/>\nthat said the modular nature of 4th should make it fairly easy to mock up. the big thing will be deciding how epic you want your game. <br/>\n(ie you want leveling, you want campeign, you want medal of honour) and then probably taking paragon level characters (probably Scoundril and Soldier and captain(based on cleric) and Demolitions specialialist (based on wiz) , take their hp at that moment, hack their spells into something that makes sense or just plain cut them [wizard is probably going to be the worst offender here) give a few basic powers such as full autofrigginmatic that are in line with the paragon tier at will powers and go to town. )<br/>\n<br/>\njust what i would do if i wanted to<br/>\n<br/>\nLogos                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174176/#Comment_174176" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-08T13:58:22+00:00" title="October  8, 2008  1:58PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As for guns, I was rather fond of the 2dx system that 3.x used.

Second, make it so that Flanking works at range unless the target has cover.  Third, make the Warlord's various "Attack that guy in melee" power work at range.<br/><br/>That way, a Rifleman (Fighter) lays down suppressing fire that doesn't score the kills, but directs the target's attention and forces an inefficient response (via Marks and the Fighter's high HP) while the Marksman (Ranger) actually lays down the really effective fire, and the Commando (Rogue) sneaks around for a clear shot.  The Officer (Warlord) directs the fire most efficiently (at-will "you, attack him!" powers), and yells at people to keep their heads down, reducing their risk profile (via healing powers).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
