It's more a matter of the price points.  I have a wishlist on IPR and when I pick up a game that's in it like Grey Ranks, I also pick up a less expensive game in the same order, like Best Friends, to get free shipping.<br/><br/>For the record, I thought it was pretty funny when I was doing it, too.  But I was really happy that I'd get to have my teenage wartime tragedy when I wanted it as well as my backstabbing petty girl-hatred.

For 15 bucks, a low page count doesn't bother me... when it the price hits 20 or higher, I want to feel like the book is somewhat substantial or I'll start to waffle on it.  Steal Away Jordan is a good example.  It's 20 bucks and 47 pages.  That's the kind of ratio that makes me go "Hmmmm" a little.  Like I said, I know high page count does not equal quality product... but still.  It's hard to make my brain ignore that completely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94938/#Comment_94938" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T22:11:56+00:00" title="September 11, 2007 10:11PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If I'm ordering from IPR I never buy anything solo.

That $22 game can be paired with a ton of $14, $15, and $16 games that will get me slightly over the mark, which I'm comfortable with.<br/><br/>At $25, I'm looking at the $10 books and there isn't as much there I can impulse buy.<br/><br/>Looking under Books at IPR, I see five games at the $10 price point (two of which I'd consider purchasing on impulse) and eight at the $11 to $12.95 price point (only one that I'd purchase on impulse).  For your $22 game, I'm looking at one at $13.95, three games at $14, seventeen at $15, and six at $16.  There's about nine books in that group I might impulse buy.  (There's nothing at $13 for this skinflint.)<br/><br/>So initially, I'd be happier with your $25 price point because I know that the majority of the games are at even dollar price points and that there are a lot of games at $15 and $20 (twenty-nine offerings at twenty bucks) I can combine to get my order to $35.  Upon reflection, I see that there's fewer options at the $10 mark to balance a $25 book.<br/><br/>So here's my order at both price points:<br/><br/>Grey Ranks alone, USPS priority shipping:  $27.80<br/>Grey Ranks plus Cat, free shipping: $37.00<br/><br/>Grey Ranks ($25) alone, USPS priority shipping:  $30.80<br/>Grey Ranks ($25) plus The Secret Lives of Gingerbread Men, free shipping: $37.00<br/>Grey Ranks ($25) plus Cat, free shipping:  $40.00<br/><br/>So with this, I actually see a larger pool of impulse purchases at the $22 price point than I do at the $25 price.  Psychologically, I see with my $22 + impulse purchase, a total in the thirty dollar range; $25 + impulse is in the forties.<br/><br/>Having taken the time to review IPR's offerings, if a game is below $20, I'd be more likely to order it if the price is a multiple of $5.  Once we hit games over $20, it's harder to pair up games at IPR to get that magic cheap bastard number I'm looking for.  I'm neither more nor less likely to purchase Grey Ranks at $22 than I would at $25.<br/><br/>As a customer that wants to save as much as he can, I'd be happier if Grey Ranks was $22 than $25, but the difference isn't that much.  As the price point and matching impulse buy products to get free shipping doesn't bother me as much, if I were Jason Morningstar, I'd strongly consider selling my game for $25.<br/><br/>Now if I were Joe McDonald with Perfect at $18, I'd be more likely to buy that game at $20 because there is only one thing at $17 I can pair that with or several things at $20.  And I'd much rather buy something on impulse if it's less than the thing I went to IPR to purchase.  If I were Joe, I'd raise my price to $20 or drop it to $15 so it would be picked up on impulse by shoppers that went in to purchase a $20+ book.  But because there are so many things at the $15 price point, there's more chance of someone picking up Play Dirty than Perfect to round out the shipping deal; I'd go with $20.<br/><br/>This is also why I believe Clinton's The Prince's Kingdom would sell more if it cost one cent more.<br/><br/>While I was looking up prices and products at IPR, I came across two examples of pricing combinations there, one good and one bad for the gamer on a budget.<br/><br/>Cold City is $23 and Cold City Companion is $12, which is a perfect pricing match for someone trying to get free shipping.<br/><br/>Conspiracy of Shadows is $20 and the CoS Companion is $14, which means I'm going to have to eat the shipping costs or scrounge for a low priced game that I don't have.  If I'm on a budget, I'm less likely to pick up the CoS games because the Companion isn't $15.  CoS winds up costing me about $6 more than it would if it was priced one dollar higher.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95191/#Comment_95191" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T12:44:03+00:00" title="September 12, 2007 12:44PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you for letting me shine a flashlight into your brain.

Something small, simple, and not very colorful?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D" title="Thomas D"><img alt="Thomas D" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://landfill.thesnakefarm.com/images/misc/idescols.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D">Thomas D</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95192/#Comment_95192" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T12:47:06+00:00" title="September 12, 2007 12:47PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Of course, all the above is assuming that your major retailer is IPR and IPR keeps the free shipping on all domestic orders at $35.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D" title="Thomas D"><img alt="Thomas D" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://landfill.thesnakefarm.com/images/misc/idescols.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D">Thomas D</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95195/#Comment_95195" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T12:53:54+00:00" title="September 12, 2007 12:53PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 12, 2007 12:54PM by Thomas D.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would have picked up vs. Outlaws if I didn't already own it.  I suspect that the majority of vs. Outlaws sales at IPR come from people wanting to meet that free shipping goal.  Phil Reed should offer it two-packs to fill that pricing gap.<br/><br/>There's a lot of great stuff at the $25 level.   If I were going for a $30 product like Spirit of the Century, I'd grab up a nice little five dollar product to meet that level (like extra card decks for the Shab-al-Hiri Roach or a booklet of fifteen towns for Dogs in the Vineyard).  If it's a product that I can easily use multiple copies of, I might order two if I'm picking up a $25 product.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D" title="Thomas D"><img alt="Thomas D" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://landfill.thesnakefarm.com/images/misc/idescols.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D">Thomas D</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95200/#Comment_95200" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T13:07:18+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  1:07PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 12, 2007 1:08PM by Thomas D.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Gregor Hutton</cite><em>Best Friends</em>would skip out the door with<em>It Was a Mutual Decision</em>,<em>Breaking The Ice</em>,<em>Shooting The Moon</em>,<em>Panty Explosion</em>, etc.<br/><br/><em>Grey Ranks</em>would be trussed up and bundled forcefully into your mailbox along with<em>Cold City</em>,<em>carry: a game about war</em>,<em>Dictionary of Mu</em>, etc.<br/></blockquote>\nGoing back to Gregor's post, Best Friends + one of any of the games he lists &lt; $35.  Best Friends + Grey Ranks &gt; $35.  As a gamer, there are a lot of games I'd like to own, in many different styles and genres, and not much money in the wallet to spend on them.  I would assume this would account for the strange marriage of game purchases.  (Which I why I listed Cat and The Secret Lives of Gingerbread Men with my Grey Ranks purchase above.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh" title="jdrakeh"><img alt="jdrakeh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/909/nZA3BEK4G6OHW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh">jdrakeh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95216/#Comment_95216" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T13:56:50+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  1:56PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite><br/>This is what self checkout was made for, in my opinion.</blockquote>\nUnfortunately, this was in the days before self checkout.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95282">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95282/#Comment_95282" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T16:39:58+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  4:39PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm clearly aiming at the international market where we don't concern ourselves with such things as this "free shipping" you talk of.<br/><br/>Man, I feel like a dirty make-weight now, or something.<br/><br/>Hey, the Cold City Companion is virtually running out the door these days too, I think it's just great value at only $12.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95379/#Comment_95379" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-13T07:00:50+00:00" title="September 13, 2007  7:00AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just bought "The Secret Lives of Gingerbread Men", "Dust Devils, Revenged" and "Steal Away Jordan".
