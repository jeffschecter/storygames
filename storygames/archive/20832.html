And maybe we Italians are extraordinarily laid-back, but there's been no game in my approaching-30-years-long career as a role-player which hasn't taken me &amp; my pals longer than the designer expected.<br/>For example, when I read "3 hours" I thought "3-player Fiasco", because regular 4-player Fiasco usually takes me longer!<br/>I do run into a lot of situations where I need as-short-as-possible RPGs, though, like when introducing people to role-playing at public events or in after-dinner sessions with parents (most of the time I can only manage to fit a simple board-game in there, but there have been exceptions).<br/>That's why I've designed my only published/released games so far (<i>Enter the Avenger</i>, <i>Awkward</i> and Italian-language-only <i>La casetta di marzapane</i>) to fit into 3-hour or shorter slots, BTW. Other games I've successfully and reliably run within 3 hours include:<br/><br/>Ben Lehman's <i>Clover</i>, <i>Skew</i> (very easy to facilitate and good for teaching first timers) and <i>Amidst Endless Quiet</i>.<br/><br/>Eero &amp; Sami's <i>Fables of Camelot</i>.<br/><br/>Jiituomas Harviainen's short larps <i>Serpent of Ashes</i> and <i>The Tribunal</i> (recommended for 8-12 people, sorry).<br/><br/><i>Invisible Empire</i>, from Worlds Without Master.<br/><br/>Some 2-player games: <i>S/lay w/Me</i>, <i>Murderous Ghosts</i>.<br/><br/>Some games described as "game poems", including <i>The Vicar is Coming for Tea</i>.<br/><br/>Also <i>It's Complicated</i> and <i>Mist-Robed Gate</i>, but these aren't -like- easy or beginner-friendly games.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457408/#Comment_457408" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-23T04:03:11+00:00" title="October 23, 2016  4:03AM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 23, 2016 4:03AM by BeePeeGee.">edited October 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Where can I get <i>Musette</i>?

Even then, that's probably no more than 2 hours left to play the town, which might or might not be enough for a very uncomplicated town. And even <i>then</i>, it'll feel like just a demo or tutorial if you don't plan on playing again (same PCs, new town).<br/><br/><i>Apocalypse World</i>, <i>Don't Rest Your Head</i>, <i>Sorcerer</i>, <i>The Shadow of Yesterday/Solar System</i>: these only make sense as one-shots if you design one-shot scenarios for them.<br/><br/><i>Polaris</i>, as a one-shot game? It only makes sense as a demo run to <br/>"sell" (or literally sell) the game to people who will then play it as <br/>designed.<br/></blockquote>\nAwesome Rafu, thank you for all this info and the time you put into this response; it is super helpful and I really appreciate it <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457447/#Comment_457447" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-24T17:01:59+00:00" title="October 24, 2016  5:01PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Of those games, only a few fall into the intersection of "games I know anything about" and "games that I think would run well in 3 hours or less."<br/><br/>InSpectres is a clear win in this space. <br/><br/>Shinobigami can also do it, but you'd need to move it along briskly. <br/><br/>Lasers &amp; Feelings is great for this.<br/><br/>The Quiet Year will fit in this space if you follow the instructions of removing cards for a shorter game.<br/><br/>Blades in the Dark works great in this space too - my normal sessions of it are like 2.5 hours, and they feel like a ton of stuff happens.<br/><br/>I bet The Warren would work, but I haven't tested it.<br/><br/>You could run Mouse Guard in 3 hours if you used pregens.<br/><br/>Stay the heck AWAY from Houses of the Blooded, Blood &amp; Honor and World of Dew for this - they have substantial startup time.

Whatever you choose, prep as much as possible. You're basically losing the hour of the four-hour slot where you make characters, explain the setting, and so on.<br/><br/>For short sessions, I prepare cheat sheets with all the reference a player needs to understand what's going on. If the game has collaborative setting creation, I short-circuit this by either just telling them the setting for the session or giving them 2-3 choices. I make index cards with names of people and places for them to riff off.<br/><br/>You also have to GM aggressively. Remind people how much time they have. Push scenes to conclusion. Scene framing games need very aggressive framing, pushing things into conflict as soon as possible. <br/><br/>Of the games you listed, I think only Fiasco was <i>designed</i> to run in a shorter slot (2 hours, but it often stretches to 3-4).</blockquote>\nThanks for the great suggestions Adam.

Although no narrative is explicitly called for in the rules, one seems to always emerge naturally from the process in a very fun and organic way.  It works great as a stand-alone game, and could also be incorporated into any larger game campaign that involves the characters discovering an object.  The playtests I've done so far have been very successful and clock in right around 3 hours, or a little less.<br/><br/>If you or anyone else in this thread would like to try it, I'd love to hear your feedback and find out what your group came up with!
