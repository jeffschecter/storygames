Not only do we boast the best indie array (heck, it's on par with anything else in Europe, most likely), but there's also the largest number of participants (easily over 3000, I understand) interested in all sorts of gaming. (I recommend the annual boardgame design competition, whether as a participant or judge; this year is all about games you can play in under ten minutes.) I know not what Jukka is saying about not getting hands-on experience; perhaps he just doesn't visit us in room 25, so he's stuck with the dull types for the whole convention. It's also cheap, as you can sleep on the premises in specially reserved rooms.<br/><br/>Damn, this reminds me: I should ask whether those british people have time for Ropecon this year. They were entertaining last time, but I'm sure a repeat experience could be better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_157336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157336/#Comment_157336" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-18T08:26:17+00:00" title="July 18, 2008  8:26AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 18, 2008 8:29AM by TomasHVM.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been to all the festivals in Norway, and <b>Holmcon </b>is by far the best if you want modern games, relaxed atmosphere and inspired discussions. This years RPP-slam was wonderful! We had 1 hour to make games, and then all of us got to play 3 of them and voting for the best. Until now HomCon has been held in the private home of Matthijs Holter. He is talking about renting a hotel next year though. I'll participate whatever he decides.<br/><br/>I would love to go to <b>Fastaval </b>too, at least once, as I have heard a lot about it. A lot of the scenarios made for that festival is top of the line; experimental, exciting and fun (I've tried several of them at HolmCon: Matthijs is a great man for bringing new games into Norway).<br/><br/><b>RopeCon </b>would also be an experience I'd like to have, but further down the list. First I would like to visit <b>LinCon </b>in Sweden; a small and traditional one, but one I've heard a lot of nice things about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
