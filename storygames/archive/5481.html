What do you author the text in? What do you work with the graphics in? What do you lay it out in? What do you make the character sheets with? And so on.<br/><br/>My answers for Solipsist are that I wrote the text in Microsoft Word, and also did the basic layout of tables, headings and the like in word. Graphics were primarily drawn on paper, scanned, altered in Photoshop, and then saved as TIFF files. The character sheet has also been done in Photoshop, but this has been less than ideal (I hate Photoshop's vector tools with a passion). Layout will be done in InDesign, which will also be used to produce the PDF copies.<br/><br/>Many years ago I used to do my character sheets in Aldus' Superpaint (only for the Mac I think), which was both a vector and a bitmap graphics program at the same time. I didn't use it for Solipsist, even though I still have a copy and a computer that can run it, because it's support for bitmaps over 72dpi was very bad.<br/><br/>So what do you use?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122914/#Comment_122914" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-30T05:41:50+00:00" title="January 30, 2008  5:41AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here is my advice: if your text will be long, don't use a word processor. That is, not word, not openoffice, and so on. (and by long, I mean more than 10 pages)<br/><br/>It sounds maybe counterintuitive, but those programs combine layout and text writing in a non very healthy way, IMO. If you are writing a lot well, that's mostly text. Get a powerful text editor (most of them are for programmers) and learn how to use it. <br/><br/>More importantly, use  a Source Control Management system, learn its concepts, and enjoy the perfect tracking of changes, merging of contributions from fellow authors, and so on.<br/><br/>Better yet, there are free tools floating around: <a href="https://www.assembla.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.assembla.com</a><br/><br/>Here you can sign up for free, and use either Trac+Subversion or Trac+mercurial. <br/><br/>As for the formatting, if you write in reStructured Text you can generate alpha/beta and WIP versions pretty much on the fly, in HTML, LaTeX, PDF, whatever. And it will still look simply like well written, readable text. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText</a><br/><br/>When your text is complete, it will be trivial to paste/convert it in a more rich format...<br/><br/>Now, these are probably very geeky suggestions, but yeah, I'm a sysadmin and programmer and technogeek, so sue me <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>(besides, many of y'all are, too)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122916/#Comment_122916" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-30T05:46:28+00:00" title="January 30, 2008  5:46AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I write everything in Emacs, using reStructured Text or Markdown for formatting.<br/><br/>As for graphics and layout, I've used something different for every game, which is a huge pain and stupid.

Recently, first with Adobe's maddening decision not to carbonize Frame or release a port of Frame that would run under X-Windows on OSX (in fact to officially end-of-life Frame on the Mac entirely), and secondly with Apple's recent (and final) abandonment of the Classic subsystem on OSX, I have finally been cut off from FrameMaker unless I take heroic measures (i.e. run it under Sheepshaver or some other Classic Mac emulation package, or run it on a Solaris server and use my Mac as a display client).<br/><br/>Accordingly, now I'm a bit adrift, but almost certainly will attempt to use Pages and/or InDesign as a replacement for projects going forward that involve layout (i.e. character sheets, reference pages, and the like).<br/><br/>For simple text preparation, I use Emacs but am taking a very, very close look at Scrivener.<br/><br/>At work, I use Word, and I can confirm that it does quite a decent job for preparing 50 page white papers and executive summaries. However, its layout abilities are maddeningly inconsistent, its table features frustrating, its header/footer management frustrating, its list and cross-reference creation cumbersome, its graphics handling pathetic, and the underlying engine itself seems rather fragile. All this from the "industry standard" tool.<br/><br/>I look forward to the day when Cringely's prediction comes true, Apple buys Adobe, and re-writes and releases FrameMaker as a top-class word processing environment (which would not be as crazy as it might seem, given that a very solid version of Frame once existed for NeXTStep). I wonder if Apple still uses Frame to write all their documentation, or whether corporate fiat has moved everyone over to Pages at this point -- if the latter, then it's conceivable that Pages will get, over time, beefed up to the point where it supports the kinds of features that Frame made great (superb handling of long document composition, very good handling of page layout especially repetitive positional features, very good handling of graphics, and superb handling of cross-references and list generation).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue" title="Rob Donoghue"><img alt="Rob Donoghue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.logrus.com/~moose/tinyhat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue">Rob Donoghue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122921/#Comment_122921" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-30T06:20:56+00:00" title="January 30, 2008  6:20AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I take a moment to share Viktor's pain regarding Frame.  I cannot express how much I loved that program.<br/><br/>I actually do my writing in <a href="http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.html" rel="nofollow">Scrivener</a>, which is a writing program.  It's an odd class of software - it's not a word processor, and it's capabilities as such are  minimal.  Instead, it's designed from the ground up for novel writing, so it's all about places for clippings, references, research, notes, and keeping lots of different pieces of writing sorted according to your needs, with a full screen mode which is a lessing for easily distracted people like myself.  It's fantastic, and would probably be even better if I were actually writing a novel. <br/><br/>This is a  robust area of software for OSX, since there are competing products like Avenir and Copywrite, but a staggeringly sparse one on the windows side (though <a href="http://www.softwareforwriting.com/pagefour.html" rel="nofollow">pagefour</a> seems cool).

I use text editors all the time in work (I am a programmer and web designer by trade), but it would never have occurred to me to use them for writing the text of a game.<br/><br/>Why? Because to me layout and text are intertwined. I need a notion of headings, and what will be numbered paragraphs, or tables, or indented, to guide my writing, I can't just drop those things in later. At the same time I don't want to have to worry about the exact presentation of those (i.e setting up counters manually and the like) while I write. Words strikes me as a good halfway between those two camps, I can keep track of my document outline and heading structure at the same time as writing. Also I need the spellchecker so badly, and BBEdit just doesn't cut it <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/><br/>(As for source control in my game writing, I wouldn't be so cruel to myself!)<br/><br/>And there are also aesthetics.

Technically speaking, the quote mark and the apostrophe for most text editors are actually the typographic symbols for inches and feet. For most folks, that boils down to: Do your quotation marks and apostrophes actually curl or are they straight up and down. Look at the apostrophes in Clinton's example. They're straight up and down. <br/><br/>Here's an example with two identical sentences. The first one is wrong; the second one is typographically correct: \n<blockquote><p>Here is a quote. "To be or not to be." It's Shakespeare's.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cTo be or not to be.\u201d It\u2019s Shakespeare\u2019s.</p></blockquote>\nThe same thing is true for em dashes, en dashes and a host of other special characters (for example, fractions, though they're pretty rare unless you work at a company that prints a lot of recipes and woodworking plans, ahem). <br/><br/>Now, most good layout software fixes this problem, but it's a pesky-as-hell problem. And, since I'm a type snob, I fucking hate it when people don't realize this. <br/><br/>Word fixes this problem automatically, unless you turn that feature off.

I am 'separation of style and content' all the way through, Everything I write, if I possibly can, is semantic markup passed through CSS and then loaded into templating systems.<br/><br/><b>But ...</b> having said that, I am not sure I agree that it is true when writing other sorts of text. In a game, like any visual medium with fixed sizes pages, you care about the shape of sentences, the balance of headers, orphan sentences and the like, and that actively influences what I write as well. I couldn't leave it all till I got to the presentational stage (and lets face it, you can't really in CSS either, because you need to know which elements are going to need markup so that you can tag them). <br/><br/>Actually of all the approaches here typing directly into the DTP software sounds nicest to me <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Maybe I should fork out for InDesign, it's a lot cheaper than my new TV for example <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Anyway, as before, great answers, keep 'em coming!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122954/#Comment_122954" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-30T07:32:08+00:00" title="January 30, 2008  7:32AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt, notepad is not a text editor <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Emacs, gVim, scintilla and similar are.<br/><br/>Special characters missing?  On the one hand, you are using a really bad text editor if you cannot input unicode characters, and on the other hand more than minimal formatting, style and fancy characters are probably something to be left for the pre-layout phase, unless you are completely sure your layout program can digest UTF-8 text correctly (which especially on windows is a nontrivial question).<br/><br/>I'm amazed that a programmer (Hituro) would think using a text editor is worse than word... what editor do you program in? Some IDE like VisualC, Eclipse or Netbeans? In that case I feel your pain <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>There's a reason if I did not mention them before. <br/><br/>When writing in vim I can automatically format paragraphs (reflow text, etc), I get automatic indenting, syntax coloring (what's marked bold/italic in rest is actually bold/italic) and lots of nifty tricks. Also, I'm orders of magnitude faster when doing edit-y stuff like search and replace with complex patterns.<br/><br/>Besides, if you write correct reST you get table of contents and chapter/paragraph numnbering for free, bulleted lists with auto-counting, and so on.<br/><br/>Same thought goes for SCM: I can understand a non programmer cringe about it, but a coder? What's not to be liked? There are also nifty graphical programs to use the scms. And with a project system like Trac you can browse your text via web browser, see differences between arbitrary versions graphically, and maybe use some of the project management stuff like the milestones and ticketing system to keep organized (but that's probably overdoing it, unless it's a collaborative endeavor with contributors very far away).<br/><br/>The kind of editor mentioned by Rob is probably the very best (I'd still use vim 'cause I'm a nerd for it): it lets you organize various resources, inspirational material, layout (as in text concepts layout), and so on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Blake%20T.%20Deakin" title="Blake T.

I use the "vanilla" Styles--rigorously, so Word doesn't propagate them (guys, just turn off the formatting toolbar, open the Style palette, change the Show filed to "Formatting in use" and you're golden!).<br/>Layout - Undecided. I would use FrameMaker, but I'm going to do most of the real layout work on my Linux laptop (my FM is Win, not willing to WINE it) and so I'll be working with either Scribus or OpenOffice (depending on how easy it is in Scribus to do conditional text).<br/>Artwork - GIMP.<br/><br/>Note that I did the core system design writing in a way that minimized repetition and cross-reference. Now, I will be doing the "fill out" writing and examples and such within my layout program. I do this because I, too, like to see how the design in coming together while writing (purely for aesthetic joy--it doesn't keep me from fiddling format later or killing cows earlier).<br/><br/>Aside: You can type special characters on Win machines by using Alt+NumPad sequences (hold down Alt key while typing a sequence of numbers on the NumPad, NOT on the number line above the alphabet keys). For instance:<br/>em dash: \u2014 Alt+0151<br/>en dash: \u2013 Alt+0150<br/>ellipses: \u2026 Alt+0133<br/>open/close double quotes: \u201c\u201d Alt+0147/0148<br/>singles: \u2018\u2019 Alt+0145/0146<br/><br/>To find the ASCII code value (the number to type) just run Character Map (<b>Start &gt; Programs &gt; Accessories</b>, if installed) or check an online reference. Anyhow, long story short: in Win, yes, you can type commonly used special characters in any application (including online web forms, as I did above).<br/>David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122997/#Comment_122997" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-30T08:57:31+00:00" title="January 30, 2008  8:57AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I write in TextEdit, a very basic text editor for Macintosh.

It masks problems.  Thing is, if you write your copy well, it will be clear, readable, and comprehensible even in ass-basic text with no formatting outside of carriage returns.  Contrariwise, if your copy is not clear, readable, and comprehensible in ass-basic text with carriage returns, <em>your copy has problems</em>.  Nice pretty layout may mitigate those problems, but it cannot solve them.  The only thing that can solve them is copyediting, which you may not be as willing to do (like Rob) if it's already in pretty layout and fits on the page so well.

But yeah, if your text is heavy on tables that could well be a dealbreaker.

It is designed to write 20-50 page white papers and executive summaries. And over the years, Microsoft's focus-group approach to design has accreted it with features to the point where the access to those features does not match well with their importance.<br/><br/>As one in-depth example, for technical writing, effective use of formatting styles is essential.<br/><br/>Styles means defining the format for a text element in a catalog, being able to quickly and smoothly apply that style in the text, and then being able to quickly and smoothly adjust that style after the fact (even to the point of "passing it" between documents). With very few exceptions, Word's access to these vital features is at least two or three steps more cumbersome than it needs to be. What is worse, there have always been hidden inconsistencies in their implementation that <i>vary with platform</i>, so a writer is forced to re-learn where the pits are whenever they switch from version to version or platform to platform.<br/><br/>For an example: suppose you define a Base style for Headings, so that all heading styles will inherit a certain characteristic. Then you decide that your Section Headings really need to be in 12pt. <i>Then</i> you decide that you don't want your Section Heads to be any larger than the size defined in the Base style. In MS Word 2004/Mac, the only way you can effectively say "just use the default point size" is to <i>know what it is and manually set it to that value</i>.<br/><br/>For another example. Say you define a template file and styles including Heading styles (and you <i>did</i> use all of Word's default "hidden" Heading style names, right? But that's a whole other example) and you want those Headings to have no more or less indent than the standard Base text style so that all headings are flush left. Every time you base a new document on that style (in MS Word 2004/Mac), Word automatically resets the indent for all your heading styles to 0.08". See above example for how you can't fix that by simply adjusting the base style. You have to go into every style definition for every heading that you use and reset that indent to 0".<br/><br/>For another example, we could talk about how in-elegant it is to (a) apply styles, (b) remove style application, or (c) edit styles in the interface.<br/><br/>By contrast, FrameMaker's implementation of styles is <i>much</i> more elegant. Access to any style can be gained quickly and easily from the keyboard as long as you know the name of the style you want (CTRL-9 plus the start of the paragraph style's name to apply it to the paragraph currently containing the cursor). Access to modifying any style can be gained quickly and easily from the keyboard (CTRL-M to open the Paragraph Style Designer). You have much better granular control on how style updates apply to your existing document (do you want to update all paragraphs with Style X, or only this paragraph, or only paragraphs that applied Style X without customizing it in the document?).<br/><br/>Nearly every feature essential to writing is implemented with the same access-complexity in Word as all the ancillary features that you hardly ever use, unless you make it your business to write executive summaries or white papers.<br/><br/>The real answer to the question "Why? Can't you just do it in Word?" is "Yes, you can." Just the same as, if you're a single man who commutes five miles to work downtown every day, living in apartment, with reasonable public transport outside your front door, you can buy and use an SUV. And that SUV will get you around. But every single day it presents you with small niggly inefficiencies that you either notice as annoyances and sigh about, or eventually they drive you made -- it's hard to find parking and when you do, your truck doesn't quite fit; it's expensive to buy gas; the apartment parking spots are built for small compact cars, and you always risk getting your SUV dinged on either side, unless you take the extra wide spot next to the dumpster, but then you have to put up with the stench, and remember not to park there on Tuesday nights because the big dump truck comes before you get up  Wednesday morning, and that's how you had to pay hundreds of dollars to fix your last big paint problem. Not to mention all the cool, pretty women that work in that hip book store next door to your office who now look at you with loathing every time you come in because one of them saw you parking your Escalade...<br/><br/>So, yes, Word will (given enough horse-whipping and patience)  do most of what you want it to do, but it will make you sweat and work more than you should have to. And some things it just won't do.<br/><br/>(For example, if you want 24pts to appear before a header style when it's in the normal flow of text, but <i>not</i> when that header appears at the top of a page, well, I'll leave <i>that</i> thorny problem as an exercise for the reader...)<br/><br/>By contrast, FrameMaker was <i>purpose built</i> to handle long, complex, technical documents and do it efficiently. Nearly every single feature of importance in Frame is accessible from the keyboard (and I'm sure that Clinton can regale you with similar tails of efficiency about Emacs or Vi). And, for those coming from anything remotely close to an Emacs world, they will happily notice that the keybindings in FrameMaker are alarmingly close to Emacs keybindings which are alarmingly close to the default keybindings in OSX's default text editing controls. For things like "go to end of line", "go to start of line", "go up a line", "go down a line", etc, etc, etc.<br/><br/>Word provides a fairly rich set of keybindings itself, but most of them demand that you take your hands away from the standard row of keys. Emacs' modeless keybindings, or VI's modal keybindings, are much, much more efficient. And as for all those features that demand that you use the UI because they don't have keybindings out of the box...<br/><br/>I've said enough, I think, for you to get the idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag" title="viktor_haag"><img alt="viktor_haag" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/591/nDZQG5TW1V86P.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag">viktor_haag</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123247/#Comment_123247" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T06:53:04+00:00" title="January 31, 2008  6:53AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: renatoram</cite>Word has a horrible record for mangling and utterly destroying the files you are working on, for example (this *might* have changed in recent versions, but I use it very rarely).<br/>...<br/>It uses a binary format, which means that it cannot be (easily) version controlled.

When you turn this feature on, Word changes the way it writes information into your document's file; instead of re-saving out your entire file every time you save, from scratch, Word saves out only a set of "deltas" or "changes" (I believe). This makes the actual save time to disk much faster. It also grows the size of your file eventually out of all proportion, <i>especially</i> if you're the kind of person who (a) has automatic saving turned on as a precaution, and (b) tends to make lots of little tweaks and adjustments to get things "just right". It also makes it harder and harder for Word to manipulate the internal structure of your file, vastly increases the chance that your file will become mysteriously corrupted, or that Word will simply fall over and die.<br/><br/>If you must use Word for any serious work, please ensure that you never use this feature. It has caused much more grief than it has ever prevented.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123249/#Comment_123249" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T07:03:15+00:00" title="January 31, 2008  7:03AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Which of the options mentioned are free?

Word was never really designed to handle documents of this size. The key with Word is always to limit the use of features to only those that you absolutely need, and to learn where all the pitfalls and potholes are. If you're writing (for example) a simple manuscript or thesis (I say simple only from formatting requirements), then Word can probably handle such a task without significant difficulty. However, the <i>process</i> of actually doing the writing would be more efficient and faster using other tools. Anecdotally, I'm about 25 to 50 percent faster using Frame than I am using Word, and I have a "power user" understanding of both applications. But the actual efficiency figure depends highly on the content I'm writing. If all I'm doing is entering text with minimal formatting (i.e. a manuscript), I'm only marginally more efficient in Frame (or Emacs, or another Emacs-style-keybinding environment) because the keybindings to support text editing are more efficient.\n<blockquote>Now I think I'd want a little more layout control than that now (mostly to do with styles for headers and whether they could have graphical backgrounds), but it still works fine.</blockquote>\nSure, it works, but there are other options that do a <i>better job</i> and more efficiently, many of them for much less expense or headache.\n<blockquote><br/>Word did use to have a Master Document feature for linking and organising chapter files into bigger books, but it seems to have vanished from newer versions. I know it was there back in version 5 (on the Mac), but not in 2000 as I remember. Maybe it's come back in a newer version, I'm not sure.</blockquote>\nIt's still there (as of Mac Word 2004), but it's not nearly as visibly accessible, which is probably a good thing. Master Documents and Sub-Documents, when I last really exercise them, were (in fact) a very useful and powerful tool. I also remember them being <i>very fragile</i> and highly idiosyncractic. You had to learn exactly the right way to go about doing things, and stick to that way, or you were in for problems of nightmarish proportion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123251/#Comment_123251" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T07:06:08+00:00" title="January 31, 2008  7:06AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: viktor_haag</cite>Word is not designed well for technical writing.

I am not convinced they are in all cases. Moreover  my latest game *is* 20-50 pages, not 300. That is not knocking the criticism of word, but wondering if this is more a case that Word is wrong for many other things you do, and so you naturally avoid it for writing game text too, as opposed to be word being wrong for writing game text.<br/><br/>As one in-depth example, for technical writing, effective use of formatting styles is essential\n<blockquote>For an example: suppose you define a Base style for Headings, so that all heading styles will inherit a certain characteristic. Then you decide that your Section Headings really need to be in 12pt.<i>Then</i>you decide that you don't want your Section Heads to be any larger than the size defined in the Base style. In MS Word 2004/Mac, the only way you can effectively say "just use the default point size" is to<i>know what it is and manually set it to that value</i>.</blockquote>\nBut ... but ... that's using Word as a DTP package, not using word to write text <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Eric was asking "What's wrong with using word to bang out your text" and I think that question pre-supposes you won't be using it for layout too, in which case this doesn't matter so much (my own contention that "layout does matter while writing" aside)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123254/#Comment_123254" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T07:13:58+00:00" title="January 31, 2008  7:13AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Or, if you use that feature take the time to reopen the file from OpenOffice Writer and re-save it, even if in the very same .doc format. <br/><br/>OO normally saves word files that are from half to a tenth of the size...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag" title="viktor_haag"><img alt="viktor_haag" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/591/nDZQG5TW1V86P.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag">viktor_haag</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123256/#Comment_123256" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T07:16:39+00:00" title="January 31, 2008  7:16AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Which of the options mentioned are free?

Vi is also freely available on many platforms, especially if your platform comes with a decent shell and suite of utilities. I'm not sure if there's a free, convenient, version of Vi for Windows.<br/><br/>Most of the Macintosh editor and word-processor options are not free, but they are inexpensive. For example, a full version of Nisus Writer Pro costs you 80 dollars if you buy it over the 'net, 90 dollars if you want physical media. Nisus Writer Express (it's leaner kid brother) is half that cost. Scribus (the open source layout package) is open-source.<br/><br/><i>Scrivener</i> (which I think is the editor-for-writers that I and others meant when we said Scribus, above) is 40 dollars.<br/><br/>Mellel, an excellent word processor for academic writing and general purpose word-processing, especially if you're using non-Latin-1 text encodings, is 50 dollars for a download, and 65 for a physical media package.<br/><br/>Pages comes in a package with Numbers and Keynote (iWork) for 80 dollars.<br/><br/>By contrast, the non-educational version of MS Office costs 400 dollars or 240 for an upgrade if you need the version with Exchange Server support (i.e. office environment), or 150 dollars for the home edition (which also comes without the Automator workflow stuff they package in the standard edition).<br/><br/>The ironic thing about the proliferation of options available on the Macintosh is that I actually think that, over its lifetime, MS Word <i>on the Mac</i> has been a superior option to the Windows version from a usability point of view. This was not true for a stretch of time, but it was in Word's original incarnation when it first went GUI on Windows (I still have friends who remain very, very bitter about when they were forced off of a DOS version of Word), and it has been so for the last few years (since Office.X on the Mac). And yet the options available at lower prices on non-Windows platforms also generally tends to be richer and better, as far as I can determine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123257/#Comment_123257" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T07:23:07+00:00" title="January 31, 2008  7:23AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Which of the options mentioned are free?

Hituro</cite><br/>Which rather leads one to ask, are games technical writing? I am not convinced they are in all cases.<br/></blockquote>\nI think in nearly all cases, yes they are. What distinguishes technical writing?<br/><br/>\u2022 It's primary purpose is to educate or explain.<br/><br/>\u2022\xa0A strong secondary purpose is to be used as a reference<br/><br/>The kinds of text and presentation elements that make those two goals easier are, in my opinion, better served by tools purpose-built for the job.<br/><br/>For a strong example here, look at the creation of an index. Most indices in the RPG world are created by hand, after the layout is already done. Why? Because the tools used to create the layout for the press do not elegantly handle creation of index lists. This means that, if for some reason, the pagination changes after the index has been created, <i>updating</i> the index is a <i>nightmare</i>.<br/><br/>Now, look at an anecdotal bunch of RPG reviews, especially of long or complex games, and see how often the lack of an index is complained about, or a poor index. The rule of thumb for a "good index" in the technical publication world used to be <i>one index page for every 10 pages of text</i>. The number of complex RPG books that even come close to this ratio is very, very small.\n<blockquote><br/>Moreover  my latest game *is* 20-50 pages, not 300. That is not knocking the criticism of Word, but wondering if this is more a case that Word is wrong for many other things you do, and so you naturally avoid it for writing game text too, as opposed to be word being wrong for writing game text.<br/></blockquote>\nI take your point, but I think the flaw there is that <i>even for the simple goal that Word is designed for</i> (i.e. simple 50 page documents with very carefully defined sorts of text elements), there are options out there that are cheaper, easier, more  robust, and more elegant to use.\n<blockquote><br/>But ... but ... that's using Word as a DTP package, not using word to write text <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Eric was asking "What's wrong with using word to bang out your text" and I think that question pre-supposes you won't be using it for layout too, in which case this doesn't matter so much (my own contention that "layout does matter while writing" aside)</blockquote>\nAh! OK, then the answer to your specific question is this: I don't want to pay 150 dollars for a text editor when I can get a more powerful, more capable, tool that's purpose built for editing text, for much less money (in some cases as little as none at all other than the time-cost it takes to download it from the 'net, install it, and learn to use it).<br/><br/>And, frankly, I don't consider simple text-element formatting styles (such as for headings, headers, footers, character elements, and such) to be "layout" or "DTP". Getting good control over simple text-element formatting styles is an essential part of "word processing" and working with your text, especially in technical writing tasks where the structure of the text is much more complex than a standard simple manuscript narrative.<br/><br/>Working with such text is so much easier when it's very evident what the <i>structure</i> of the text is (where the chapters, sections, sub-sections and paragraph titles are, and where they are in relation to one another).<br/><br/>In this respect, Word actually does a fairly decent job (along with outlining, which Word actually does fairly well at). But again, there are other, cheaper, more elegant tools that also do this without the overhead headache of Word.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123273/#Comment_123273" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T07:42:23+00:00" title="January 31, 2008  7:42AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: viktor_haag</cite>For a strong example here, look at the creation of an index.

Many writers actually find formatting and UI a distraction that they cannot avoid, and thus the popularity of "full screen editing modes" for editing.<br/><br/>For myself, I have in the past found that I can focus my work in on two tasks -- when I'm doing infrastructural work, I'm working with structure; when I'm writing, I'm writing. And, I've found that, if I spend a good deal of thought and time on the infrastructure tasks of setting up page-designs, text-element styles, and so on, that this actually makes the eventual text preparation tasks more efficient in the long run.<br/><br/>For example; if I know that the eventual page design will be in a 9x6 landscape format page design, that could easily inform a change in the way I present the information, rather than a 6x9 portrait page design. There are fundamental principles of good writing that are independent of the presentation, but I strongly mistrust the radical stance that good writing has absolutely nothing to do with presentation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123286/#Comment_123286" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T08:10:09+00:00" title="January 31, 2008  8:10AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As for using the mouse... it mostly depends on how you type, I guess.

(My opinion.)</blockquote>\nWell, for what it's worth, that's Standard Operating Procedure in most businesses for whom I've done tech writing, editing, web publication, web press printing, and graphic design. MS Word's default toolbars (ribbon?) are setup (frankly) for very ignorant home users making posters for yard sales. And admins banging out bog-standard letters and signs for the break room.<br/><br/>You do ANYTHING professional with nearly ANY application, then Step One is setting up the toolbars (and palettes and file location preferences and templates and custom macros and project-specific plug-ins &amp; fonts) to work best with your production pipeline and your particular role in that pipeline. If I'm an editor (in Word or in anything with rev control) then all I run is the Reviewing toolbar and pane. I'm a writer, all I show is the Styles palette/pane. I'm a template designer, I've got a bajillion toolbars running, possibly including the Visual Basic and Forms toolbars.<br/><br/>The only reason "2 inches" of your screen is being consumed is because you let it. The only reason you consider "the most useFUL commands [to be] buried" is because of your very particular manner of working with the tool (and, maybe, a limited understanding of where things are and why, in the Word paradigm?).<br/><br/>Ah, shit... I sound like a fanboy. Look, I can say EVERYTHING above about every single application mentioned in this thread, barring some of the neigh-functionless text editors (which don't offer any form of meaningful UI and, thus, no meaningful UI customization). It's Business As Usual, folks... just BAU. You want a "perfect" UI and application-use paradigm, invent HAL 9000.<br/><br/>Repeat after me: "There Is No One True Way. There Is No Perfect Process.

GIMP for adjusting pictures, Microsoft Publisher (2003) for layout of cards &amp; gaming board. I upgraded from Office 2003 to 2007 during the development of the game. <br/>\n<br/>\nExperiences:<br/>\n<br/>\nWord: I cursed a bit about not being able to find stuff in Word 2007. And it also crashed for me a couple of times, something I have never experienced with the 2003 version. Though error recovery is pretty quick and painless - perhaps that says a lot about the program... The only real killer features I have discovered in 2007 compared to 2003 for me is the ability to set copy-paste to respect target formatting. I've always hated that standard paste action not just pasted the content but also source layout. Also, Word still cannot produce clean html output, but insists on polluting the generated html with a lot of office presentation markup.<br/>\n<br/>\nMicrosoft Publisher did the job - but perhaps the best thing was its low complexity, as I haven't done much layout work before.<br/>\n<br/>\nGIMP: It's free and rich on features though some are very specific so you have to learn to navigate your way to what you need. I had some minor screen update problems in a few cases.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wrote the game text over 6 months, I was the only contributer but had text out for review through a web site in a couple of iterations. I developed a folder structure with documents for each part of the game, including a project plan and a scratch pad for loose ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor version control and back up, I took full copies of the folder after each significant change. I wrote snap shots to a dvd every once in a while. The final folder ended up on just a bit over 130 MB, including pictures, complete pdf and layout files. Not really a problem with a hard disk space of 150 GB. I've not rolled back once, but it gave me the freedom to experiment and now I have a history of the development of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm a professional software developer so I'm used to version control &amp; powerful text editors.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo why did I use Word?<br/>\n<br/>\n1. It's the easy choice. For me it is free (supplied as part of work) and readibly available.<br/>\n2. It has low learning curve. I can jump right into designing the game, I don't have to learn a new tool first. (the 2007 upgrade was not too pleasant in this regard)<br/>\n3. I'm used to working disciplined and structered. Hence I know not to fall into the layout procrastination trap. Focus on writing and structuring in the early part of the process, postpone layout for later. (but do have an initial styleset that is not too far away from what you may end up with)<br/>\n4. I'm not planning to keep on developing the text for several platforms (html, print, pdf), hence the final production steps are a one time job.<br/>\n5. I can switch easily from writing modus to layout modus, doing wysiwyg adjusting of paragraphs and headers while not having to copy from a text source to a layout or a generated output. This includes working with pictures and e.g. visio diagrams.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, for my next project, I think I will try out PageFour. Perhaps it will give me additional support for the early part of the process, giving me some freedom and flexibility that multiple documents in a folder structure does not yield. I'd love working in an environment where I could easily produce and distribute multiple formats of the game (html, pdf, print) from a version controlled source - but I don't want to spent 14 days to set it up.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy game is in Danish and can be found here: http://frederik.jensen.net/montsegur1244                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue" title="Rob Donoghue"><img alt="Rob Donoghue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.logrus.com/~moose/tinyhat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue">Rob Donoghue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123467/#Comment_123467" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T13:20:18+00:00" title="January 31, 2008  1:20PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For character sheets, my first choice is Omnigraffle, but it's mac only.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123470">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123470/#Comment_123470" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T13:23:54+00:00" title="January 31, 2008  1:23PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Omnigraffle, tell me more ...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123476">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123476/#Comment_123476" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T13:44:27+00:00" title="January 31, 2008  1:44PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnigraffle/" rel="nofollow">OmniGraffle</a><br/><br/>Very simple and fun to use. <br/><br/>I'm surprised its counterpart OmniOutliner didn't come up in the discussion of text editors.

You have to keep stopping to reflow text and add pages and all the rest (possibly losing you text along the way).

This is clearly true by virtue of the fact that (as has been said) they use text frames that don't automatically generate new pages when full and so forth.<br/><br/>But that absolutely is not true for desktop publishing (DTP) programs like Frame above, Word, OpenOffice, etc. I have authored straight to every one of them (any many others over the past 25 years), and I never feel like I'm tying my own hands because I have WYSIWYG view of the content as it's being written (I would suspect someone of being OCD or something, if such a thing is <i>truly</i> a problem).<br/><br/>Thus, these two quotes are just not true, because they conflate page layout tools with DTP:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: renatoram</cite>Also, in my experience layout/dtp programs are very, very poor in writing support tools</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite>I too *have* written text directly in a DTP package (mostly for magazines, con handbooks and the like) but it is a pain in the neck.</blockquote>\nMight as well say that Illustrator or Photoshop or GIMP is a pain in the ass to author it. Of course they are! You're using an extra-fine horsehair brush to paint your house, so to speak.\n<blockquote>If such a feature existed in dtp programs it would be useful...</blockquote>\nThe feature of a keyboard command to save and close? Uh, <b>Ctrl+X, Y</b> (close, Yes to save changes) isn't good enough? (Works in nearly every package I've used.) While we're on the subject of powerful keyboard commands, what's the emacs keyboard command to set a paragraph to be 24 pt type, bold, small caps, centered? (In Frame, with most templates, it's <b>F9, T, Enter</b>: select Paragraph Style, T to select "Title," Enter to choose Title)?<br/><br/>Or do you mean reams of custom scripts? Other than Macros (which every DTP package has, as I recall)? Other than <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.framescript.com/" rel="nofollow">FrameScript</a></span>? Other than complete UI customization (including key bindings) via a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.daube.ch/docu/fmaker08.html" rel="nofollow">config file edit</a></span> (Frame) or some Preferences settings (all DTP packages)?<br/><br/>Again, I sound like a fanboy, but what I'm trying to prove (yes, prove, not allege or opine) is actually ANTIfanboy: the "terminal text editor, good; anything WYSIWYG/DTP, bad" argument is just bullshit, period. One can <i>prefer</i> one over the other. One might notice one's particular workflow is <i>augmented</i> by one or the other. But to argue a Right Way is crap and does the OP little good, presuming that this is more than a poll thread, presuming that he (or another reader) wants to weigh pros and cons of packages and processes and choose one that suits him.<br/><br/>Finally, if what we're actually talking about is measurable functionality and feature count, I find it very hard to believe that a plain text editor--terminal, windowed, whatever--is measurably, demonstrably more feature-rich than a DTP package. Faster? Maybe--I haven't noticed sluggishness in DTP tools since, oh, 1995 or so. Less distracting? What, you write is a blackbox, on a featureless desk, with Bose noise damping earphones on? Great, then I'm sure the barebones UI IS less "distracting." I work in offices or at my desk before a lovely window view of a busy Durham street, with NPR on and smoking cigarettes and occasionally getting up to piss or grab another drink--a handful of toolbars REALLY isn't gonna make or break my concentration, I don't think (but YMMV, of course).<br/><br/>But (as I suggest above with my example Style application) it strikes me as being disconnected with reality, to say a tool which can't perform layout functions is somehow "more functional" or "more powerful" than a tool which does everything a text editor can do AND controls layout. That's like saying a go-kart is more functional than a fully loaded minivan. Again, it might be faster; it might keep your eyes "on the road" rather than on your DVD player screen. But it definitely, absolutely, measurably isn't "more functional." "An editor that barely does cut/paste and not much more" is a patently false straw man, propped up to support a conservative (I'd even say blindly stubborn) work habit.<br/><br/>OK, rant over.

Thus, they don't even attempt to serve the same goals:<br>* PM is the ideal per-page layout-intensive tool<br>* FM is the ideal document-production and -publication tool.<br/><br/>See? They could <i>both</i> be "ideal," because they serve different goals. If someone (like madunkieg above) wants to finely manipulate every page's layout, or do complex graphic manipulation (strange text wrapping or curving, etc) then they'd need PageMaker's tools and workflow. Conversely, someone putting together something akin to a technical manual (i.e. most big-budget, traditional games) then they'd want something like FrameMaker's (InDesign's) workflow. Having used both professionally for many years, I can assure you that reversing that goal:tool relationship will make for nightmares at production time, never mind if you have to deliver to several channels (PM can do it, but not smoothly like FM with WebWorks.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Craig_in_ACT</cite>having just switched to Macs, I have had problems finding decent software at affordable prices.</blockquote>Something wrong with (free) OpenOffice?<br/><a href="http://download.openoffice.org/other.html#en-US" rel="nofollow">http://download.openoffice.org/other.html#en-US</a> </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/5481/what-software-do-you-use-to-write-your-games/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/5481/what-software-do-you-use-to-write-your-games">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/5481/what-software-do-you-use-to-write-your-games/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/5481/what-software-do-you-use-to-write-your-games/p3">3</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F5481%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F5481%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
