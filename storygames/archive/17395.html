My experience with the game was mixed, I had quite a bit of fun with the game when I played it, but my group and I found using the book as a reference very difficult. We spent arguably as much time trying to find the rules for how to do something as we did actually doing it because they were often in unusual locations within the text. <br/><br/>It\u2019s been four years since this game was released. Story game forums, what kind of experiences have you had with this game? Has anyone played a long game of it? Has anyone had their character go up an age bracket?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_393880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393880/#Comment_393880" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-19T07:14:59+00:00" title="October 19, 2012  7:14AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 19, 2012 7:15AM by Joe_McGuffin.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I\u2019ve only played it once, and I\u2019ve never run the game myself.

I still think the basic "dueling wagers for narrative control" mechanic is completely fantastic, but just about everything else in that book flat-out does not work the way it says it does and eventually it just became too frustrating to work with, work around, and house-rule.  We remember our campaign very fondly, but none of us are in a rush to actually play again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393884/#Comment_393884" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-19T07:42:38+00:00" title="October 19, 2012  7:42AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played it several times as one-shots, so we haven't experienced things like the season mechanics, etc. Seemed to work okay, though the book was a bit of a mess.<br/><br/>In my view the ven are more interesting once some peasant invents the guillotine.  And Blood and Honor is a better game all around.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
