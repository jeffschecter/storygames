Well then let me tell you where you'll see more ENWorlders running cool games and hanging out anyplace else this year: NC Game Day XIII. <br/><br/>What's that? You ARE going to GenCon this year? Well you don't want to have to wait until August to see everybody and game with them do you?! NC Game Day XIII is the answer to all your problems.<br/><br/>This one is our annual 2-day event and it's going to be HUGE. It'll be on April 21-22 at the Talley Student Center at NC State University.<br/>Here is some important info that you need to know, especially if this is your first time attending:<br/><br/>To schedule a game, the following must happen in order:<br/>1) You must register on this site, and request to be a GM. If you were a GM on a previous Game Day, you should still be a GM on future Game Days, so go to step 3.<br/>2) An admin (Rel or Morgenes) approves you as a GM.<br/>3) You submit your event (My Events -&gt; Submit), filling out the required fields and submitting it.<br/>4) An admin reviews and accepts the event, and assigns it to a table.<br/><br/>Important: Right now we are only taking submissions for GMs to run games. If you're going to run a game send it in as soon as possible. Players can take a couple weeks to look over their options. At 5PM on Friday March 30th we will open up registration for players to sign up for these games. We will continue to take submissions for games after this but there is a good chance that folks will already have signed up for stuff so the sooner you get it in, the better your chances of having players.<br/><br/>If you want folks to be able to sign up for your game in advance, use Open Game as the "Game Type".<br/><br/>On Saturday the "slots" are 5 hours long and run from 9 AM - 2:00 PM and 3:00 PM to 8:00 PM. On Sunday the slots are 4 hours long and run from 9:00 AM - 1:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM. When you submit your event, you probably want the start and end times to line up with those slots so that it doesn't interfere with other games your players might want to play.<br/><br/>The additional notes field is so you can tell the administrators about any special needs you might have, like a certain size or shape of table, or power needs.<br/><br/>If you have previously registered at the NC Game Day site then you don't have to do that part. If you've previously run a game at NC Game Day then you don't need to register as a GM. All you have to do at that point is submit your game and have it approved and slotted.<br/><br/>We strive to make this a very social event. We do dinner on Friday night beforehand so if you're in town then make sure that you join us. We also do dinner on Saturday night and, if enough people are still in town, we'll do it on Sunday too! I can't wait to see all the usual suspects as well as some new faces around the gaming tables this time.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58244/#Comment_58244" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-28T08:10:31+00:00" title="February 28, 2007  8:10AM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mark!  Every time I run stuff at GameDay, I run it for my friends.  Every time I play stuff at GameDay, I ... play it with my friends.  They have a fantastic venue, the staff is friendly, and it's a great value, but there is zero interest in Story Games there.  <br/><br/>How can this be changed?  Because if it can't, I'm gaming somewhere that doesn't require me to wear pants and drive to Raleigh that weekend.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58245/#Comment_58245" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-28T08:14:37+00:00" title="February 28, 2007  8:14AM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's time for my spin-off thread "Should You Wear Pants While Gaming?".<br/><br/>Sorry, carry on.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58246/#Comment_58246" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-28T08:15:26+00:00" title="February 28, 2007  8:15AM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I got a single individual that isn't on the same level as my acquaintances to join my previous TSOY game. <br/><br/>How did I get anyone like that to play it? Early advertisement and discussion of the game on ENWorld. I had to pimp my game and build interest.
