The combat descriptions in early versions of White Wolf's "Werewolf: the Apocalypse" were raised as an explanatory method that used this technique. I'm told that "Marvel Heroic Roleplaying" vaguely followed this kind of approach in it's rules. The classic "HoL" was entirely hand-written and very "comic-book" in style, but it generally confused things a lot more than it clarified them.<br/><br/>Can anyone else think of good uses for this technique?<br/><br/><a href="http://vulpinoid.blogspot.com/2013/07/a-new-way-to-teach-rules.html" rel="nofollow">Further thoughts on this can be found over at my blog</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417827/#Comment_417827" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-05T17:10:57+00:00" title="July  5, 2013  5:10PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also check out <a href="http://www.kaleidoskop.se/in-english/the-supercrew/" rel="nofollow">Supercrew</a>.<br/><br/>I find the weakness to this approach is that it's harder to use as a reference book and find something in the rules.

I will be producing three books.<br/><br/>One document is purely setting material...written as a in-world travelogue, where every page has a description of somewhere interesting, something unusual to meet or find, or details about a particular group of people. Each page of this text should have a half dozen potential story hooks on it. Lots of flavour and hopefully fun to read.<br/><br/>One document is purely rules...very little crossover to the setting, except where needed (eg. character generation). This book is pretty clinical and formulaic in it's approach. <br/><br/>The third contains all the play examples, and the crossover between the rule document and the setting document. This is the one that would be written in the form of a comic. It would contain a light hearted look at how the game-play would work in a "typical" group of gamers; generally following the description provided in the first post for this thread. This document would be full of page references for the rule document, and will provide a few examples of the core rules from different perspectives, as well as touching on some of the more unusual rules and how they interact with the fiction and the meta-gaming talk around the table.<br/><br/><br/>For a future project I'm thinking of a simple game told purely in the form of a comic book. But for the moment, I'll be seeing how this visual approach for clarification works.<br/><br/><i>EDIT: I'm still very interested in seeing how other people might have done it though.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417829/#Comment_417829" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-05T17:57:24+00:00" title="July  5, 2013  5:57PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a> did this with some of his explanatory comics.

If you can't say what you need to in a few short bullet points, then yes, please give me pictures.  That said, the traditional comic book format is unlikely to be optimal for conveying practical information in a quick and easy to reference way.  Something more like an assembly instruction manual, with some text, graphic, and comic elements, might be preferable.<br/><br/>For examples and inspiration, though, comics rock.  I'm hoping to give all my basic instructions for my current project in very brief text and then provide explanation in the form of comic book examples.

You need to think of what's the strengths of doing it in a comic style and then use those advantages to form a game around it. <b>Supercrew</b> is presented as a narrative of some characters, but I think the comic needs to be in a narrative of how to play the game. No characters. Just visual aids to understand the game. I think it's also important to have regular summaries of what just have been read. Those summaries can double work as reference pages.<br/><br/>I don't have any knowledge of how to make comics, otherwise I would give some suggestions of the advantages of that media. I myself have been thinking of writing a comic-like game with illustrations like <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Crow+comic&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=r4v&amp;rls=org.mozilla:sv-SE:official&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pGPdUaTdOuW44ATd1IGQBA&amp;ved=0CEIQsAQ&amp;biw=1120&amp;bih=564" rel="nofollow">The Crow</a>.

Tenra Bansho Zero also uses comic pages to explain the key procedures of the game and introduce the setting and characters wonderfully. I'd agree that you'll also need a quick reference chapter with all the rules for the game, but anything that can be turned into a procedure with step-by-step instructions can be easily explained with a comic.<br/><br/>Prep, scene framing, interaction between players and GM, character creation, describing the world and color for classes, races and fronts, combat, skill checks, actual play examples, flow of the game, all these can be turned into comics with a proper amount of side notes, infographics and humor.  For all the rest, old plain walls of text will do.

That's an unnecessary barrier. You could just as easily list a short url like game.com/video-3. Takes up less space, doesn't look hideous, isn't as wide a barrier.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418297/#Comment_418297" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-14T00:37:46+00:00" title="July 14, 2013 12:37AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good point.<br/><br/>Maybe this would be a better technique for a cyberpunk-genre game, where at least it's more fitting as an immersive form of demonstration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418301/#Comment_418301" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-14T05:51:54+00:00" title="July 14, 2013  5:51AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the idea that if folks start using video for instruction, eventually gaming will spontaneously produce a<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Ross" rel="nofollow">Bob Ross</a>-like figure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
