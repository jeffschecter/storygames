Why do I object to playing an elf?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first thought was that DITV in particular doesn't endorse the beliefs I'm wary of. I may be God's judge, jury and executioner, but I can use this to make a commentary about ultimate power, about the nature of religion, about corruption, etc. Even if the game did endorse this, I could play against type and expose the horror of such assumptions. Otherkind is built on the premise of evil, expansionist humankind and the only characters available are good, tree-hugging fey.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I'm asking you folks - how do you play outside your beliefs, and what do you think is the difference between games that endorse and games that explore certain beliefs?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247719/#Comment_247719" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T02:00:12+00:00" title="December 21, 2009  2:00AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's just a game.

I have the most horrible time playing D&amp;D because I find the alignment system gross. Absolute good and absolute evil, and killing is morally acceptable as long as you kill evil. Getting into that mindset is really hard for me. I don't know as if the game endorses this belief system, but it clearly celebrates it. <br><br>Dogs in the Vineyard is a different ball of wax. It's a game set in a period with morality we turn our nose up at now, however it encourages you to challenge. What I find interesting though is that when I've run Dogs in the Vineyard, the players will often go along with the morality of the game and the period and have their characters make decisions that they themselves find questionable.<br><br>The difference to me isn't something I can articulate, but the same players who are like, "Woohoo! I just tortured and beheaded an orc!" in D&amp;D get real uncomfortable and squirmy when in Dogs in the Vineyard they have to make a judgment about whether a misbehaving child will be left with her overly permissive parents or sent to her harsh, authoritarian, and traditional grandparents.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247756/#Comment_247756" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T07:30:41+00:00" title="December 21, 2009  7:30AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Chris,<br/><br/>Great stories (like <i>The Harp and the Blade</i>, by John Myers Myers, or <i>Memories</i>, by Mike McQuay) and great games (like <i>My Life with Master</i>, and <i>Dogs In the Vineyard</i>) are the writer/designer's view of the human endeavor, and how the world works. You read the story, you play the game, and you're having a conversation with the designer. And coming to the end you put his view through the filter of your own experience, and have a post-game conversation. Is he right, or is he full of shit?<br/><br/>But if the writer/designer's view is plain, or if you've already had lots of conversations with artists about the wrenching and moral permutations of the Holocaust experience, then you don't need to have this particular conversation. I bet one of these two things is true for you about Otherkind: Vincent's view is plain, or you've already had lots of conversations with art that addresses Otherkind's views.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247760/#Comment_247760" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T07:44:50+00:00" title="December 21, 2009  7:44AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The thing is ...<br/><br/>Well, let me rephrase.<br/><br/>Here's the thing that I do when I play these games. I put my beliefs on the table. I go into the game saying "this is a game that's going to comment on my beliefs, and it might end up saying that I'm wrong." There's two ways that I do this.<br/><br/>First, is that I play a character with opposite beliefs of mine, and I play him as strongly and honestly and non-hypocritically as I possibly can. I play the Dog who thinks that forgiveness and a prayer session are going to fix everything, say.<br/><br/>Second, I play a character that represents my beliefs, and I play him as strongly and honestly and non-hypocritically as I possibly can. I play the Dog who's a liberal reformer, or the Dog who's a sin eater propping up Utopia by breaking the rules. Say.<br/><br/>In both cases, I accept that play is going to render my character wrong in his beliefs, or right in them, and that I have to be prepared for the consequences of that on my self and my beliefs. I make as sympathetic a character as I can and I toss him into the wringer and see what happens.<br/><br/>Now, otherkind may not actually do this, on account that otherkind isn't really a done game. Doing this requires trust that the game designer isn't dumb.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Storn" title="Storn"><img alt="Storn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Storn">Storn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247766/#Comment_247766" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T08:22:30+00:00" title="December 21, 2009  8:22AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had a tough time with Dogs... being a mormon paladin didn't sit well with me at all.

Same thing probably goes for 1950s style racists - their descendants are still around of course, but these days they make subtle and bizarre arguments for building a wall between here and Mexico, rather than (say) just shouting 'nigger' at people in the streets.<br/><br/>But there are wispy, granola-munching, tree-hugging, post-humanist types everywhere these days. You have probably had to get along with them on an almost daily basis. And a tiny voice has probably whispered in your mind that, in spite of whatever homespun ideology you've come up with according to which they're the lowest of the low, some of them are decent people who can defend their opinions with a spookily high degree of plausibility. This is, of course, quite stressful, and who (apart from the occasional artsy Jeepform type in Scandanavia) would ever want to replicate such stress during gametime?<br/><br/>I call it the "close to the bone" theory.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247910">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247910/#Comment_247910" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T17:02:47+00:00" title="December 21, 2009  5:02PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I rather enjoy games that challenge me. Then again, as a fairly radical "tree-hugging hippie" who doesn't think the word "progress" has the least relationship to history, Otherkind sounds right up my alley. But mostly, I play D&amp;D, because I can only find other players willing to play that. I've heard people say that D&amp;D has no big, moral case it makes. I beg to differ; I think it seems transparent only when you accept it so completely that, for you, it seems self-evident, rather than a moral case. To me, its combination of simplistic, black-and-white judgments and the lesson that you can solve your problems with the simple application of violence make the theme we play out every other week reprehensible. Ironically, for all the Christians who once feared D&amp;D for undermining their religion, my contempt for it comes precisely from how much it <em>celebrates</em> that religion.<br/><br/>Then again, I rarely feel safe to mention the way I see the world. I live surrounded by views that I find as antithetical to my own as you probably consider 1950s racists or Mormon gunslingers to yours.<br/><br/>I started designing my game with the goal of sharing a glimpse of the world as I see it: as Paul put it, "having a conversation with the designer." I've spent a lot of time agonizing about where that line falls, between a good conversation, and brow-beating and sermonizing. I've come to this: it really depends on where you make the argument. If you have to come out and say it, I think it falls into brow-beating. On the other hand, if you present rules that create a certain emergent experience, you've made an argument. You've presented a small model of how you think the world works, and you've asked people to play it out, to see your point.

I didn't try to subvert the game's assumptions but rather run with them - the wildly destructive humans enslaved their own kind, and the quest to free those innocent humans and then turn them on their masters consumed much of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think what distinguishes games like Otherkind and Dogs from the 'fundamentally hyperconservative' superspy/technothriller genre and the hack-n-slash of D&amp;D; is that the latter <i>assume</i> an ideology rather than pushing one. That changes how you play the game and how you react to what the game has to offer. That may be an arbitrary distinction, but I feel it's the difference between 'I'm doing this because it's logical within the metaphysics of the world' (D&amp;D; - killing orcs) and 'I'm doing this because it's the metaphysics of the world' (Otherkind - sabotaging lumber camps).<br/>\n<br/>\nI think Paul Czege is on the money when he talks about the artist's view being plain or the conversation being one I've had already. I do find Otherkind's view a bit plain (I won't extrapolate that to Vincent's view) though there is more depth to it than first met my eye. And I've recently had quite a few conversations about environmentalism so I'm probably burnt out from that theme.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> wrote:</div>\n<div class="QuoteText">Might I hazard a guess here, hoping not to offend too badly?<br/>\n[...]<br/>\nBut there are wispy, granola-munching, tree-hugging, post-humanist types everywhere these days.

And a tiny voice has probably whispered in your mind that, in spite of whatever homespun ideology you've come up with according to which they're the lowest of the low, some of them are decent people who can defend their opinions with a spookily high degree of plausibility.

For instance, in D&amp;D, I've recently played up the fact that all the PC's act like complete psychopaths. I have enough space for that in that game: it works out pretty easily to have the townsfolk react to you with the kind of horror reserved for serial killers and sociopaths. <em>Dogs</em> does almost nothing <em>but</em> provide that kind of space. I've loved it ever since the town I ran, where a father killed his gay son, and I wrote "I love my boy 2d4" on his character sheet. A man kills his son, and he has "I love my boy" on his character sheet.

"The apple seems red," gets closer to it.<br><br>In GURPS, you have attributes. You "are" this, you "are" that. GURPS says, "The world <em>is</em> a certain way. Certain fixed things exist. Things can have inherent qualities." This stands out as a big philosophical statement precisely because I disagree with it. Which has stuck in my mind a lot: statements seem big or not mostly based on whether or not we agree with them. If we agree, then they seem small and hardly worth mentioning. If we disagree, they seem very big.<br><br>You pointed out some other statements GURPS makes\u2014that "physical reality" matters most, and that the same rules govern everything. Widely accepted statements, certainly; so, few people ever saw them as political, religious or philosophical claims. But pull them out like that, and they certainly do seem like it, don't they?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Davis</cite>p.s. now I can't stop using E-Prime to express myself ^_^</blockquote>\nIt takes some practice, and after you do it for a while, it'll really start to mess with your brain! I still only write in it, and even then I sometimes don't; I don't have it down nearly well enough to speak in E-Prime. I'd trip over my words and stumble even more than I do now!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>What I find more interesting is what we're doing when we play a game with certain assumptions or points of view. Are we endorsing them? If we aren't, are we somehow lying? I have no idea, I go back and forth all the time.</blockquote>\nI don't know how lying relates to roleplaying. It seems like a very close relation of the question of how lying relates to theater, or storytelling. Lying usually denotes an intent to deceive, and since actors, storytellers and roleplayers don't expect anyone to confuse the opinions of their characters for their own opinions, it seems to lack an important criterion of "lying."<br/><br/>Can you really, honestly engage a viewpoint you disagree with, though? Or does your disagreement undercut your portrayal? I don't know. But the problem reminds me of the Existentialist critique of communication. The Existentialists point out all the ways in which true, genuine communication can never really happen. Granted, but I've always reacted to that by asserting that we can <em>try</em>, and even knowing that we'll never get it perfect, we can do pretty well nonetheless, and that in itself seems worthwhile.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248448">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248448/#Comment_248448" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-24T10:16:34+00:00" title="December 24, 2009 10:16AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 24, 2009 1:03PM by Beth_in_Virginia.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Buddhism is equally critical of communication, although not in the sense that it is fruitless - more in the sense that it is <i>fraught</i>, and that we just need to be mindful of this as we go about our business. <br/>I think it's possible to engage a viewpoint with which you disagree, at least if you take the tack of finding every single thing you already agree with, and then just holding your breath and doing your best. If you're attempting to portray that viewpoint as yours/your character's, then from an acting perspective, it's been my tack to just say "This is true, this is true, this is true," over and over again. As you might expect, certain things are easier for this than others - I find it much easier to act out Abrahamic rejection of other religions than to act out homophobia, since the latter hits too close to home with a part of my core identity. <br/><br/>I just started reading a neat book by the son of a business owner; the owner worked for a couple of decades in Communist "Central Europe" (the country is unmentioned). The book discusses the economic transition from Communism to capitalism, and touches on this point of yours, Jason: <blockquote>Widely accepted statements, certainly; so, few people ever saw them as political, religious or philosophical claims.</blockquote>\n"In the eyes of [neoliberal] observers, planned socialist economies were artificially manufactured systems that created inefficiencies, which would be corrected once the intervention of the Party state was eliminated and free markets were allowed to emerge." [From Communists to Foreign Capitalists, Bandelj, 2008, p. 2]<br/><br/>So! Some assumptions here, made by neoliberals, are that a) planned socialist economies produce inefficiencies and b) free markets would emerge in the absence of a planned socialist economy. This is an example of the assumption that one's own views and ideas about the world are an accurate, true portrayal of life and existence, and all other viewpoints and value systems must, naturally, be the product of poor logic or some other major fault. <br/><br/>From the perspective of workers in Communist Europe, who benefited tremendously from the regime's robust social safety net, to dismantle Communist welfare measures is to ruin their standard of living. To the American venture capitalist, to dismantle such things is to free up capital that can be invested, borrowed, lent, spent, and so on, leading to a return on his investments. <br/><br/>ANYWAY. Point is - there is no such thing as a system or design that lacks assumptions and value systems implicit at its very core - even if those assumptions are as simple as "This is all we've found that works well enough to meet our needs". For game design in particular, it's easy to detect what we agree with and what we don't (at least, I work like this): when you see mechanics that just don't interest you, or better yet, employ them in actual play, whole reams of possible game texts drop off the radar of your potential enjoyment and appreciation.<br/><br/>[edited 'cause China's workers' lot improved in urban areas, but not in rural areas, after liberalization of the economy]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_248477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248477/#Comment_248477" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-24T13:29:34+00:00" title="December 24, 2009  1:29PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jason</cite> Can you really, honestly engage a viewpoint you disagree with, though?

Personally, I don't worry about expressing my opinions through a character, because I know no one expects my character to believe the same things I do. That actually feels kind of dishonest to me, like speaking through a puppet instead of saying what I mean on my own. Then again, I play most of my games with a steady group, and they know the things I believe and the opinions I hold. Would I feel the same at a con? I don't know\u2014no con game has ever challenged me like that.<br/><br/>I find it very edifying to try to portray people I disagree with, to try to empathize with them, to try to understand why they think the things they do and what motivates them. What series of events and circumstances might have made me just like that? You have to approach that with honesty and sincerity, though, or you just wind up creating a caricature of the things you dislike. One exercise helps build empathy for people you may not like, perhaps even people you consider enemies\u2014the other does the opposite, making those people even more two-dimensional in your mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_248488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248488/#Comment_248488" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-24T15:29:00+00:00" title="December 24, 2009  3:29PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see your point; these days, though, I need more fun from gaming than I need edification.
