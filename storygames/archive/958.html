                    "The more creativity an activity requires, the more creativity its participants will display when they engage in it."<br/>
<br/>
This may seem a little tautologous, but it's not...<br/>
<br/>
So here's how I came to this conclusion:<br/>
<br/>
Last Valentine's day, I decided to write a sonnet for my wife... a Spenserian sonnet, no less (they're more rigorous than Shakespearean sonnets).  The rhyme scheme is rigid, the meter is ironclad.  They are NOT easy to write.  I worked on it all month.<br/>
<br/>
It came out GREAT.  The best poem I ever wrote, by far.  Everything else was just doggerel.  The enforced rigor required me to stretch my abilities further, and the work came out better in the long run.  Could I have done as good with a free verse poem?  Sure... but the medium doesn't REQUIRE as much, so it doesn't push me to stretch.<br/>
<br/>
I looked at RPG's in this light.<br/>
<br/>
The more requirements you put on contributions to the SIS, the harder it is to achieve, but the better the results when you fulfill it.                </div>

                            So basically you are saying that, by providing strong structure which constrains creativity in some axes, all the creativity present is channelled into the remaining degrees of freedom? Kind of like increasing the pressure by reducing the width of the channel?<br><br>So highly free-form games may end up producing less creativity than well-designed games with a lot of constraints?<br><br>Having written sonnets myself, I buy that.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

This is, I think, the ultimate great flaw in "Universal" games, that is the lack of constraints.                        </div>

                            I was thinking about something like this this morning on my commute, in re D&amp;D. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve only played 1st Edition, and later editions may have fixed this, but I get the impression they havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t. Anyway, the basic way that D&amp;D worked was, you got rewarded for killing things and taking their stuff (XP). What you could spend this on was making your Ã¢â‚¬Å“characterÃ¢â‚¬Â capable of killing more dangerous things and taking their stuff. So what did most D&amp;D play boil down to? Despite its many and arcane rules, there was nothing you actually had to do in terms of character development except optimize your character for killing things and taking their stuff, which basically meant a fighter or a mage. Sure, you <i>could</i> play a cleric, and the more experienced players would probably press you to, since while theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not as good at magic as mages and not as good at fighting as fighters, they function as a convenient kind of hit-point-renew-o-mat. And you <i>could</i> play a thief, if you wanted to fantasize about having 1337 5ki11z (did I spell that correctly wrong?), but really, most of the useful things a thief could do could be done just as effectively, or more so, by a mage and a fighter. Anything other than killing things with swords or killing things with magic was basically optional colour. Gygax even said it upfront: This is <i>sword</i> and <i>sorcery</i>. So: lots of rules, but few actual constraints, and a reward mechanism (which is just another kind of constraint Ã¢â‚¬â€œ carrot instead of stick) that didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t usually lead to a lot of creativity.<br><br>So what IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve just done in Rule of Three Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and I worked this out afterwards rather than beforehand Ã¢â‚¬â€œ is to put in constraints such as: You canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t put more than 2 points into any one element (skill, piece of equipment, attribute, whatever). Two measly points. What that does is it means you have to exercise creativity, because youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re very soon Ã¢â‚¬Å“maxed outÃ¢â‚¬Â with your strength and your big sword and your training at the Fighter School of MÃ¢â‚¬â„¢kÃ¢â‚¬â„¢lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢th. So you have to look around for some other way to develop your character, and hey, the other options are things like relationships and insights and Ã¢â‚¬Å“driversÃ¢â‚¬Â (basically, motivations). And another constraint says: You have to combine these things in groups of three which make some kind of sense in order to use them. So your character must be integrated and consistent, and your character must be developed across a number of areas, and those specifically include relationships, insights, motivations, backgroundÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ And whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more, you have to narrate how the victory you have just won brings about improvement in one of these areas. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not just, Ã¢â‚¬Å“OK, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re back in civilization, and you train for a while with your guild and pay them some gold and you go up a level.Ã¢â‚¬Â<br><br>Which sounds like IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m saying IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve written a better game than D&amp;D, which IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not claiming. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m just saying, I designed it the way I did because Ã¢â‚¬â€œ I now realize Ã¢â‚¬â€œ I thought the constraints would produce more creative results. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gratifying to know that this is the Vaxalon Principle.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Hi Fred!<br>
<br>
Your assessment is probably true, but whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the conclusion? Constraints in RPGs are good? I used to think that way, too, until something occurred to me:<br>
<br>
One major difference between writing a story or poem and playing an RPG is that in writing, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mostly about the creative output. In playing an RPG, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mostly about the creative process. I was playing highly procedural, constraining games and creating stories that sounded like the mother of rockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢roll. Everyone reading the transcript would be jealous. But how much fun was actual play?<br/>
<br/>
As you said yourself, you had to stretch as far as you could to write the sonnet. I used to be a writer, too, and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m going to make a guess here: While you were working on it, it drove you to despair, didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t it? Only when you were finally finished did the deep satisfaction sink in, because you were looking at what you had created, and said, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wow, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the best poem I ever wrote.Ã¢â‚¬Â<br/>
<br/>
Some of my PtA games were much the same. I really had to force myself to come up with something. To consider everything. Keep the issues in mind. Think of better stakes. Keep the next week on in mind. Remember everybodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s screen presence. Contribute to other peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s scenes. At times, it was strenuous. The creative output was always top. But did that reward me for the strain? Do I look back at those sessions the same way you look at your sonnet, and say, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wow, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the best SIS we ever created?Ã¢â‚¬Â<br/>
<br/>
I can only speak for myself: I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t. Fictional content is not the goal of role-playing. Actual play is the goal. So constraining rules that drive me to despair before I finally get it right donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do it for me. If I get relaxed, fluent, fun play with a fictional content that is a little shallow, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s perfectly okay. And if things get more intense without strain and despair, all the better.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            When it comes to SIS/Colour, it was talked about thoroughly, how the more constraints you add the more you could direct attention to what you know the players are nearly sure to hit during their sessions. You don't have to deal with everything, so what you do deal with can get more attention and you can force it into certain more powerful modes(DitV and Polaris).<br/><br/>When it comes to Mechanics, <a href="http://competitiverpgs.wordpress.com/2006/06/27/specific-blinders-constraints-isnt-it-getting-dark-in-here" rel="nofollow">I agree</a>.                        </div>

                            I don't entirely agree with this.<br/><br/>I think constraints are good <i>up to a point</i>. Sonnets are a good example: there's just enough constraint to fire your creativity.<br/><br/>But too many constraints stop you being creative. Let's say I ask you to write a sonnet including the words "bear", "rose", "dice", "conference", "office", "document", set in Renaissance Italy with one central female character, who's in love with a man who's unattainable because of a difference in social status. You might do it, but it won't be very creative. It'll be an exercise in getting it to fit.<br/><br/>(On this note, doyce, were your 56 words actually creative? Don't get me wrong, I'm impressed, but did the constraints actually fire your creativity? It sounds, to me, like an exercise in getting in to fit.)<br/><br/>In other words, I don't agree that "the <i>more</i> requirements you put on contributions to the SIS...the better the results when you fulfill it". I agree that some requirements will give better results; but I don't think the results then get better as you add more requirements.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            It's definitely a balance, and part of the designer's job is to make sure that the constraints support creative play rather than hinder it.  I explored what I think is the edge of constrained play with my Game Chef entry Terra Nova, which ended up being (in the GC incarnation) a rather frustrating exercise in parlor narration.  There's just not enough elbow room for creative fun within the framework.                        </div>

                            Hey, I never claimed that the Vaxalon Principle was the end-all and be-all of gaming.  Certainly, if you put TOO many constraints on play, people will have to spend so much effort jumping the creative hurdles that they'll stop having fun.<br/>
<br/>
But dudes... KKKKK.  Waiting/Tea.  Can't GET much more constrained than those.<br/>
<br/>
Frank: I found the task of writing the sonnet to be frustrating at times, even maddening, but every time I found JUST the right word, man, LIGHTNING.  And it happened OVER and OVER as I was writing it.  It didn't just come at the end.  So no... I don't think your criticism has merit, not for me.<br/>
<br/>
Graham: Straw man argument.  Certainly, any time you get silly with rules, or constraints, or color, or anything, you're going to get the kind of results you describe.  But before you get too convinced you're right, go play a game of KKKKK.<br/>
<br/>
Take a look more closely at the Principle guys.<br/>
<br/>
Does there come a point where adding constraints takes away the amount of creativity required?  Sure!  And there's the Principle at work again.                        </div>

                            I like the principle--do you think it has a lot or a little to do with the question of self selection?  In other words, that a task that from the front end looks like it demands a lot of creativity attracts people who will step up to that demand?                        </div>

                            I think we need to make a distinction between constraints and voids.<br/>
<br/>
Voids are places where the game doesn't tell you what you need to know, like scene framing in DnD.<br/>
<br/>
Constraints are places where the game tells you you MUST or MUST NOT do something, like how DitV tells you to include traits you have rolled into a conflict in your narration for that see or raise.                        </div>

                            Jason -- <em>yes</em>, working with a "tragically broken" game requires lots more creativity and commitment in order to make it work.  I think that's why we see such heartfelt brand loyalty to games which, on their own, aren't really that much.  It's that the experience of playing them and making them work provides a powerful sense of accomplishment to the players, and hence they think of it as "their game" and are positively inclined towards it thereafter.                        </div>

Yeah, I really miss that rule too.  (That playtest still sits in my mind as one of the best dang games I've ever played.)<br><br>In other news, I think it's going to be important to note that creativity does not necessarily equal fun.  I think Frank may have been getting at this above, but just because one game requires more creativity to play than another does not mean it's a more enjoyable game to play.<br><br>Now, I don't think Fred's saying that, but it's worth highlighting I think.  Creativity is only <i>one factor</i> in how much fun you have playing.  It's an important one, but there are others such as emotional resonance and humor.<br><br>Thomas                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

I'm not going to sit down and try to define creativity.  That's a fool's game.  Is there some definition for which this principle is problematic, X?                        </div>

                            Might be a hard title to claim, Fred, when people have been expounding this theory for ages in terms of RPGs. I think I recal Erick Wujcik writing an article for Dragon magazine or somesuch in the 80's in which he talked about the positive and negative effects of constraints and where the line should be drawn (as a response to Amber). That's just the earliest I can recall. I'm sure that people were discussing it right out of the gate, with ideas like whether or not players should be allowed to affect combat rolls by using creative tactics that are not suggested by the text ("look, more freedom = more fun!")<br>
<br>
The notion that constraint is important is a response to the opposite notion that freedom is better for RPGs - which is how freeform got started, when taken to it's logical extent ("I don't need Rooolz to play!")<br>
<br>
The following is a link to a post with more of my own thoughts about this: http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=2450.msg23932#msg23932<br>
<br>
Anyhow, I think that which level of constraint works to be most entertaining for a particular individual is, well, pretty individual. Hence why there are so many levels ranging from Complete Freeform (all elements including setting are created on the spot) to "Your Love For Me is Way Outta Line" level constraint (where one player has to play a dead sea-sponge on display in an office who simply does running commentary on play with small mechanical effects). All are enjoyable to somebody. <br>
<br/>
Further, it also comes down to what particular sorts of constraints people like. Some people can't stand the idea of social mechanics, for instance, because they feel that it constrains their character responses in terms of things that they prefer be free. While those same people might at the same time think that combat should not be allowed at all in their game (I'm thinking of some LARPS, as my example). So you can't simply say "I like constraint" or "I like freedom" you have to indicate where you like freedom and constraint.<br/>
<br/>
And, when all is said and done, the set of constraints that you have in play, which determine how each player can add to the SIS is, well, The Lumpley Principle. So this makes a good correllary. System is the constraints on how the SIS is formed. The selection of constraints has effects on how enjoyable play is. The latter part could also be labeled Creative Agenda. <br/>

The Lumpley Principle and the Nixon Principle are well known; I don't claim to be in their league.<br/>

                            So, I dig constraints, within reason, and have always viewed it as analgous to throwing up three walls bu leaving the fourth direction open.  What would have otherwise been a lump slowly spreading out more or less explode out the open path.  It can suck, it can be done badly, blah blah blah, but I think conciousness of constraints is incredibly powerful.  ANd hell, it gives people wonderfully meaningless things to argue about (Whose contraints are better? Why aren't you respecting my Freedom?) and without thatt, why bother with an Internet. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br><br>Got reminded of this at Dexcon this weekend.  Got to pick up Mortal Coil and, while I didn't get to play, got to talk to a number of people who had fantastic play experiences, and one point stood out.  Mortal Coil has a lot of cool things going for it, but it's ace in the hole is the fact that it give the players near total authorial control over a specific element of the setting (in this case magic).  Infinite veritical scope, constrained Horizontal scope.  In practice, it does all the things you'd want - draw attention to what's important int he game, draws in players, but still allows for direction.<br><br>Now, Mortal Coil is just a spectacular game in its own right, but any number of other narration and stakes driven games can point to a lot of the same lessons, both in what works and what doesn't.  <br><br>And hell, sports understand this principal, they're damn near built upon it.  Physical fitness depends on it.  This is the understanding that seperates good jazz from, well, not. And it's not limited to creativity.  I've got no objection to the creation of Axioms, hell, I deeply sympathize with it, but in this case, I think it's too small for the point it's sitting on top of.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>
