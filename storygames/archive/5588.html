I asked Simon for a copy and he, very kindly, sent me a PDF, with obvious instructions not to pass it on. Problem was, it was 250 pages long. It'd cost a fortune to print. It was cheaper, in fact, to upload it to Lulu and print it. So that's what I did.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Please note I asked his permission to quote him and received it).  <br/>\n<br/>\nI've been tempted to do the very same thing, except I'm of the opinion that it's probably illegal.  I only wish to upload a PDF I bought legally and only intend to print it out for my own use (e.g. not open it to the public).  But wouldn't this violate Lulu's terms of use or be a copyright violation?  Or even if it is legal, does this constitute some other ethical dilemma?<br/>\n<br/>\nI invite your commentary and guidance in this matter.

I don't think anyone could ethically and accurately advise you in this manner without knowing a lot more than what you've provided, and at that stage what you're really seeking is legal advice.  As a law graduate, but not a lawyer, I could make some fantastic arguments using both the Copyright Act and Lulu's policy on both sides though I'd feel much more comfortable arguing for infringement.<br/><br/>As to ethics, a lot could be said about the ethics of copyright.  However, I look at it more as the ethics of supporting the artists you love.  Especially for self published games, such as those found at Lulu, a substantial amount of the money these authors receive seems to come from print and print + PDF sales.  I'd feel a little slimy reuploading their work to make a cheaper copy for myself.  As to whether it's ethically the same as just printing it out at home, we could argue about that at length and I think there would be good points on both sides.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125209/#Comment_125209" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-08T12:24:52+00:00" title="February  8, 2008 12:24PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Flynn,<br/><br/>I am not a lawyer.

If so, there's the potential for someone else to order it. That would be technically outside your fair use. However, I think small publishers would forgive this provided you delete the upload as soon as you got your copy.<br/>\n<br/>\nCopyright among us small fry is really more about respect (and ethics) than law. Copyright law depends on the copyright owner to enforce their ownership -- so you only need to worry about big companies that are paranoid about IP. They might look at the small technicallity of public visibility for 6 hours as a reason to sue your ass.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that I've written this, I think it would be polite to ask a small publisher if it's okay. They're small, they're likely to be responsive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125217/#Comment_125217" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-08T12:49:53+00:00" title="February  8, 2008 12:49PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alan</cite>Copyright includes a fair use concept and printing for your own use falls under that.</blockquote>\nNo it does not.<br/><br/>Virtually nothing you do will ever fall under fair use.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Parthenia" title="Parthenia"><img alt="Parthenia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/146/nKIT0S5D0Y5QY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Parthenia">Parthenia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125221/#Comment_125221" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-08T13:03:01+00:00" title="February  8, 2008  1:03PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alan</cite>when you upload something to Lulu for printing isn't it visible to the public?</blockquote>\nNot necessarily. You can set your project to private, so you have complete control over who accesses it (by giving them the url or keeping the url to yourself). When you get your bound copy, you delete the page, and you've followed the author's instructions. Basically what you're doing then is paying Lulu to print and bind the pdf for you for your personal use.

Fuck you very much, DMCA.  Why the DMCA was such a big deal is because it revoked fair use rights for digital forms of media (it also basically outlaws some basic functions of computers, thanks to the rabid special interests who prompted the ignorant lawmakers to draft it, like the data that's stored in RAM or browser cache upon viewing a webpage).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Parthenia</cite>How is that different from printing the pdf from your computer for your personal use?</blockquote>\nYou're giving a copy of the PDF to a third party. It doesn't really matter that its temporary.  This is one of only a myriad of reasons why you'd want authentic legal advice if it's really a concern. Because a lot of this stuff hasn't been worked out, although most decisions favor the IP holders over fair use, it really comes down to an arguement in court to figure out what is legal. But, will you get caught is another question entirely.<br/><br/>If you want to cover your bum, the best way is to ask the person who owns the copyright to the game. The community is small enough that its possible with most games (even the bigger companies, although they're likely to say "no" since they usually have a legal team on staff that would have a heart attack with any other response).  If they say "no" then you can judge whether or not its ethical to proceed.<br/><br/>But I don't really truck in the PDF arena.  Are there similar areas that we already know is O.K.? Like, is it okay to do this at Kinko's or local copy shop book printing, in the case where the PDF has to be given to another person?  If that's already permissable, then I don't see how going to Lulu would be different.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125254/#Comment_125254" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-08T13:56:59+00:00" title="February  8, 2008  1:56PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As far as legality goes, all of this copyright stuff doesn't really matter.

Me, I wouldn't print anything that way that I could buy in print form.  Graham couldn't buy Trail Of Cthulhu yet, so he printed it.  Good enough for me.

Former, cool, latter, not cool.<br/><br/>Just my take on it though.<br/><br/>Bill                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125292/#Comment_125292" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-08T15:41:37+00:00" title="February  8, 2008  3:41PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm Mexican, so our "copyright" rules work a little different.<br/><br/>When you buy something (or someone buys it for you, or the author gifts you with it), the "copyright" is transfered to you.

(For example, printing a book you bought for your own personal use would be ok; printing it in order to sell it would be a big NO-NO.
