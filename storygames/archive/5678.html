That game was a|state, My First Published Game! (I could feel myself using the initial caps in conversations). Heavens, was I delighted. Time passes, things change, perspectives alter. I now look at games design in a totally different way (thank you, Mr M Snyder), but, I still love the old warhorse, percentile-based and uber-traditional as the mechanics are. The setting was everything for me. I still think it has a lot going for it.<br/><br/>Even then, there was a supplement in the works called Avenues &amp; Alleyways. More detail on the The City, more places that I had created at some vague point of the night. It's now 2008. 4 years on, Avenues &amp; Alleyways is finally out. It's a supplement in the traditional mould, it's 112 pages of Stuff About The Game World. And I think it's great. I'm delighted. <br/><br/>For all the satisfaction that Cold City has given me, for all the excitement I'm feeling about projects like Hot War and Okhrana, there is a certain frisson involved in bringing out something new for a|state. Adding to the sheer expanse of The City. Finally fulfilling a promise made years ago, to all those people who bought the game, all the folks who have stuck with it through lean times. It's also a testament to the hard work of a whole bunch of people, without who it would never have come to fruition: Paul Bourne and John Wilson, my amazing partners in this entire publishing malarky. Gregor Hutton, Iain McAllister, Brian Nisbet and Greg Saunders who all contributed areas of The City and immense amounts of time and effort proofing and editing the text.<br/><br/>Exciting times.
