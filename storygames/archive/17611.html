Never fear, I said! I have just the thing for the three of us!<br/><br/>One of my players was unfamiliar with pulp so I took a brief detour on behalf of Culture, playing some short Flash Gordon clips and part of the excellent promotional footage for Spirit of the Century's Dinocalypse Now funding campaign. Onward! <br/><br/>The role and style sheets got a significant amount of amusement out of the players and instantly did a lot more to explain the setting than my presentation of the pulp aesthetic. While they decided on sheets, I half-read, half-paraphrased the setting material from the rules and filled in details of my own whenever players asked a question. We ended up with the Ghost Detective Zebulon Vance and the Mystic Warrior Commander Chandra in dazzling brown and pink. We discovered that Zebulon turned Detective to investigate his own murder and that Chandra was from a slum in Rocket City everyone pretends not to know about and gained mystic powers as part of a familial mystic religion handed down from family on Earth before the atomic wars. When it came to making an episode title, there seemed to be between the players and the idea of jumping into the middle of an on-going pulp serial. I used the Attack of the Crimson Apes pre-made teaser (I'm new at this) and called the episode "Welcome to Rocket City" (first episode, so no Previously On). I rephrased the Previously On section as "Tell us how you joined the Danger Patrol" which seemed to do the trick. We got some juicy, short, fictional details narrated like a character reel describing our dashing heroes as the music plays. Action!<br/><br/>We loved the constant escalation from the Danger Dice and the flexibility of the all-encompassing Threat system. Commander Chandra rolled badly, though and ended up in the Vaporized part of the track real fast. Someway in, I realized that I had been doing bonus dice utterly wrong (I'd been giving them out as bonus D6's! Somewhat less useful than they were supposed to be!) I also realized I'd been counting escalation dice as successes and bonus dice as failures ... egads! The players started using a lot more bonus dice a lot more after that fix. Eventually Zebulon made his way over to the Mysterious Dark Figure while Chandra cleared up the remaining apes. A civilian he'd rescued earlier still buckled securely to his utility belt, Zebulon tackled the figure and discovered that ... well, it wasn't precisely solid and it was just as mysteriously ... shadowed without the hood of its cloak. Distressed and carrying around a distressed civilian, Zebulon wrestled with the creature and eventually got his Energy Handcuffs onto it. Chandra still struggling with the Apes, Zebulon began to interrogate the creature.<br/><br/>At this point I realized I wasn't feeling good about the Action-Interlude-Suspense formula. I could have narrated Chandra out of her Danger but the player was enjoying himself and it felt wrong. I introduced a question threat anyway (and forgot to tell Zebulon he could use his special Suspense scene bonuses). Zebulon found a weird artifact on the MDF and uncovered a plot involving the Rocket City Newspaper, something dark and powerful beneath Rocket City, a cult on Neptune and the Crimson Republic helping MDF's organization get at the dark force beneath Rocket City. I'm not sure I was entirely true to the mechanical request to answer the question "definitively" when the threat was defeated--instead with the last hit I divulged a rough but complete sketch of all the major pieces but none of the "why" or "how" or "when". Zebulon's player seemed satisfied by the implications of the revealed clues. Chandra rejoined and they carted the creature back to the Danger Manse for further interrogation and detainment (Interlude! Lower danger, regain some +'s, one-liners while driving back).<br/><br/>Over the course of Zebulon's interrogation, I had to spawn some new threats ... rather than spawn threats in preparation for the next action scene I created a threat that the MDF seemed to be resisting the Engery Handcuffs.Chandra attempted to further interrogate the MDF along more specific lines (intimidation/torture with The Black Mists) while Zebulon used his From Beyond to study the MDF's energy signature. Chandra quickly regained lots of danger and the Black Mists weirdly with MDF's energy signature sending Chandra into The Void. Then Chandra tried to teleport, suggesting this might be the shadow into which she normally stepped. We decided it was similar, but different. That Chandra could try to teleport with a chance to fail. An astoundingly unlucky die roll later, and Chandra was pushed ... beyond the Void. While Zebulon was still frantically trying to contain the MDF ... Chandra faced <i>really</i> abstract threats. And ultimately, a Disaster was met while she was trying to escape. We decided this sent her deeper. Beyond the beyond the beyond. Into either nothingness or near-nothingness (both Disaster options were sort of the same to us, here). We let Chandra create a new Patrol member, since things were getting really trippy. I wanted to keep going. :P<br/><br/>Thus was introduced Knzzyk the Alien Professor (Psychic's power). An extra-solar being come to Rocket City by way of a Mercury colony (opportunistically established during the wars), Knzzyk was trying to earn his citizenship by proving to Rocket City authorities that he wasn't just another unwanted Mercurian bastard and was in fact dependable, patriotic and whatnot. We also established that Knzzyk's people are the only sentient creatures in their home system and live on the only habitable planet orbiting their sun. How strange that must be! Knzzyk recognized the energy readings set off on his equipment as Chandra disappeared as those of beings from what his people cataloged as the M83-B system. Little is known about them as diplomatic envoys were killed after two otherwise uneventful communication missions. Further surveys have not been conducted in the system. Without much further tribulation, Knzzyk helped Zebulon construct a device that would constrain the MDF. At this point, Knzzyk's player was called away for other things so we decided we'd pick it up again later, possibly with more players filing out the Danger Patrol roster. <br/><br/>It'll be so easy to incorporate the plot into a new episode as I haven't planned anything that hasn't happened yet! I'm quite excited to see what happens next, and so are my players. Hopefully I'll be able to rattle a gang together soon to have a bigger, louder, and most of all <i>longer</i> session. If not, we can pick up where we left off with just the three and still have a longer session with a suitable resolution.<br/><br/>I really enjoy the system and want to see what more it has to offer. I forgot a few rules throughout, but the players didn't seem to mind too much since the game was plenty fun in any case. I didn't use the Action/Suspense dichotomy, and I doubt I will next time. I feel like it is unnecessarily limiting and I think at least in this game, a fluid transition was much more effective. I could have done a much better job dealing with Interludes, and I'll have to be more careful next time about giving players opportunities to reduce danger, heal, etc. I could compel players to make time for the fictionally appropriate recoveries, but I think I'll end up allowing to recover when it seems appropriate to me (namely, when there's a natural breather) or when they perform actions with the explicit intent of recovering in one way or another (teleporting back to the Danger Manse as a Mystic for a breather and to grab a new jetpack since the old one just got smashed to bits by a Crimson Ape, sort of thing).<br/><br/>I really can't wait to try it again!

Glad you enjoyed it.<br/><br/>I totally agree about the action/suspense thing. It feels forced to me, too, and I've dropped it from my current draft of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
