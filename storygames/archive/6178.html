I can't help but think it needs to be... LOUDER.  I'm thinking something like <i>Dread: The First Book of a Wicked Age</i> or <i>\xcfn \xe4n \xdcml\xe4ut \xc4ge</i>.  Something where I satisfy the urge to throw up the horns and shout RAWK, you know?<br/><br/>So help me out here, RBHAIAWADF.

I love it.<br/><br/>Here's your playlist. You don't have to buy this music, just track it down on MySpace and listen to it to get into the zone: Novembers Doom, Dark Tranquillity, Behemoth, Akercocke, Enslaved, and Bolt Thrower. Note that none of these bands are featured in Guitar Hero III (though the game does feature some head-banging tracks by Poison and Pat Benatar -- not that I'm questioning anyone's devotion to metal, here, just making an observation).<br/><br/>What you want to do is run a game that resembles the cover of a Manowar LP. Exhibits <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/23/ManowarFightingtheworld.jpg" rel="nofollow">A</a>, <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/75/ManowarIntogloryride.jpg" rel="nofollow">B</a>, and <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0a/Manowar_kingsofmetalsalbumcover.jpg" rel="nofollow">C</a>.<br/><br/>None of this touchy-feely pseudo-fantasy stuff about nice people, or dramatic tension, or negotiation, or magical fairies, or social conflict. No, you want to bust some skulls, quaff some ale, kill a demon, battle some subhuman things in a mouldering crypt, swat the buttocks of a scantily-clad princess as though she were some tavern wench, then let fly a sulfurous oath as the necromancer attacks. Your character should have iron sinews and thews. Armor, weapons, and gold should be your primary focus. Do you wear a loincloth? Well, that's pretty metal. How about a hauberk, you got one of those? Metal. Sword? Metal. Are you approaching a pile of gold with a naked woman on it, guarded by a demon with breath that reeks of carrion? Then you are troo and kult.<br/><br/>You'll definitely need some metal Oracles. For example, the following are all well and good, but they just ain't gonna cut it for a metal game:<br/>* A note written in an elegant hand, sweetly perfumed.<br/>* A field of herbs and wild flowers, alive with bees, where a certain half-bestial creature brings his many lovers.<br/>* A slight and subtle demon, child of blasphemy, craving mischief.<br/>* A slow-moving caravan with many wagons and travelers.<br/><br/>Try revising them while listening to the aforementioned bands. Here's my take:<br/>* A suicide note written in the blood of a murdered priest. He belonged to a crepuscular death-cult that sacrifices naked virgins to a dark god.<br/>* A field covered with the bodies of soldiers who were massacred by demons. The fiends issue strange ululating cries before sinking their talons into the flesh of their screaming victims.<br/>* A large and powerful demon with fangs and massive claws, come to rend your limbs and take your soul. No subtlety, no mischief. It eats people.<br/>* A burning caravan littered with the smoking bodies of the fat merchants and their weak, flabby, civilized sons. The daughters are all missing. But where are they? And who took them? And how large are their bosoms? The daughters, not the ones who took them. Unless they, too, are women. Perhaps the daughters were taken by large-breasted harpies. This would be metal.<br/><br/>Okay, that's a fairly good start, if I do say so myself. Hope that helps!<br/><br/>-- Rafael                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
