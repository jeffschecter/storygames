And thus the splatbook was born.<br/><br/>It's pretty uncontroversial in the story games community that as cool as that setting might be, it was more fun to make it up while you were playing in it, than it will be for the people that buy it, master all the details, and then play in it.<br/><br/>So that's setting then.<br/><br/>So then I've been studying and experimenting with some of the Old School Renaissance stuff. Read Grognardia, ran some Swords &amp; Wizardry (an OD&amp;D retroclone) at GPNW, have a game of it going on Twitter.  And of course part of the deal with playing with the early D&amp;D derived rulesets is they are not all that complete. Combat sure, casting some spells, a few guidelines about traps, that's about it.  Heck, OD&amp;D doesn't even really tell you what to do with those classic 6 ability scores.  So part of the OSR experience is house ruling.  The longer you go on, the more you tweak, and poke, and adjust, and add little subsystems here and there.  And back in the day, after a while, people looked at their house rules and thought, "We've got a really cool system here, we should write it up!" And they published new RPGs.<br/><br/>And as I'm doing the same thing, I'm thinking to myself "why am I playing an incomplete game? Why not just go find one that's finished, and does what I want?"<br/><br/>But what if making up rules as you go, starting with some simple, sketchy framework that has a little bit on inherent logic, could be PART OF THE FUN?<br/><br/>So anyway. That's my insight of the day.  Anyone have any thoughts or reactions to that?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_217340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217340/#Comment_217340" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-08T18:22:06+00:00" title="July  8, 2009  6:22PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1) You want talk to Levi.

The whole point is to share stuff across play experiences, else why have a magazine like Fight On! or any of the myriad Web sites that continually share OD&amp;D materials? I submit that the OD&amp;D/retroclone phenomenon as a whole constitutes a well-designed "incomplete" game.<br/><br/>For a parallel phenomenon, look at any commonly drifted story game. How many versions of DRYH or IAWA are being played out there? When I invite you to my table to play my Star Trek IAWA hack, I'm using IAWA in a way that makes it "incomplete" for my purposes, and that's part of the fun. I can easily imagine either of these games supporting a broad community sharing house rules and hacks.<br/><br/>A game design is a lot like a software application or platform. With platforms, incompleteness can be a virtue. The platform (hopefully) provides robust, well-designed core functionality, leaving the developer free to extend that functionality or connect it up in ways that fit their goals.

They can work but can also spiral out of playability if you're not careful.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I started work on Matrix Games back in the 80's people were real resistant to the idea of makng stuff up. It felt like cheating to them which honestly I never understood. It just puts the gamer in the same role as the game designer. I let people amend my games left and right. In one run of "Thunder Hamsters and the Temple of Cheese" at Origins I had a guy add the rule that he got to magically reshuffle where all the encounters were in temple. POOF! The whole game changed. It was priceless. When the next play session started the game reverted back to it's basic rules set so the creation fun could start again. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a difference between amending the rules and making up color. One sets up everything else that follows and the other affects one scene. Probably an important distinction. Universalis and my Matrix Games just tell you how to moderate the negotiation between the players rather than what the outcome should be. So the rules are a road map to how to talk rather than a destination.<br/>\n<br/>\nChris Engle<br/>\nHamster Press                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_217490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol" title="Epidiah_Ravachol"><img alt="Epidiah_Ravachol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol">Epidiah_Ravachol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217490/#Comment_217490" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-09T09:25:44+00:00" title="July  9, 2009  9:25AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find this making the game up as we go thing so much fun that I have a group of friends who get together specifically to do that one a (slightly less than) regular basis.<br/><br/>One game I've wanted to try for a while now, that's really going to need a willing group, is to pretend we're kids from the future, 16 years from now--13 years after role-playing and video games have finally been criminalized.

The players must eliminate the self, unlearn all that they've learned, and start again fresh with the wonderment of that first, utterly opaque role-playing experience, building the game as we go.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_217493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217493/#Comment_217493" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-09T09:55:17+00:00" title="July  9, 2009  9:55AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A bunch of interesting perspectives! This topic is currently of interest to me because I felt like I was in the same boat as Jesse's point 2: this isn't my kind of fun.  But I find myself having <i>a lot</i> of fun with the OD&amp;D and the house ruling.<br/><br/>Ironically, part of my drift away from the "new hotness" of the Storygaming world was driven by frustration at the relentless drumbeat of games that arrive half designed, and only function thanks to player/GM skill &amp; vigorous arm waving.  In play, mastery of and strong application of rules system has been a big part of my fun.<br/><br/>On the subject of Universalis, Matrix games, and Nomics, those games explicitly pack their extensibility mechanisms into their core mechanics.  OD&amp;D is different in that while the rules provide a starting framework, they <i>don't</i> talk about how to extend themselves, except in the vaguest of terms.  But perhaps the difference here is simply that knowledge of how to extend the rules is delivered in a separate package, the culture surrounding the rules.  Certainly my approach to my current OD&amp;D play was informed by an initial period of careful study of the current blogified wisdom the OSR cognoscenti.<br/><br/>Another difference might be seen in that in the OSR playstyle, it is theoretically only GM that has the power introduce or modify rules.  But in practice I note that my rules tinkering has hardly occurred in a vacuum, the players' interests and feedback have driven the focus and nature of my tinkering.  Much as the players interest and focus in the setting have driven the evolution of that fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_217499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/aeonite" title="aeonite"><img alt="aeonite" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.aeforge.com/~aeon/images/sg/myicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/aeonite">aeonite</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217499/#Comment_217499" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-09T10:30:59+00:00" title="July  9, 2009 10:30AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What this brings to mind is improvisational interpretation of systemic effects and die rolls, which I am growing more fond of as time goes by. Which is to say, a "20" is never just a "20" or always a "double damage", but whatever the situation calls for.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy latest, Vox (http://www.aeforge.com/vox), is all about the making up as you go, both setting and system-wise. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe way I'm running it now on Gamegrene's PBP Forum is to take things that the players feed to me and turn those into story elements. In the print version these would be Story Hooks (since Vox is a PDQ game; PDQ2 to be more precise), and there I suggest that since Story Hooks might be occurring very rapidly, that not all of them be earthshattering. There of course, the system is absent, since i'm running a diceless PBP and just sort of letting the story determine success and failure.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the print version a lot of what's possible hinges on interpretation though. While the mechanics themselves don't change or need supplementing (at least I hope not), a lot of what's possible is left sort of open ended. If you spend a Karma point to trigger a Synchronicity, how much is that going to help you? The mechanic for that is simple - you spend a Karma point - but after that point there's a Schroedinger moment between System and Setting where the GM and players have to sort of take what's hard-coded (a Karma point) and determine its impact on the game (Synchronicity). To that extent there's a great deal of "making it up" going on, since every situation in the game is unique and needs to be handled differently.<br/>\n<br/>\nHELLAS: Worlds of Sun &amp; Stone (http://www.hellasrpg.com) is dependent upon such interpretation. Before they roll, players must express what the intent of their action is. Then the GM interprets the roll (Crit Fail, Fail, Part. Success, Success, Crit Success) based on the intent. This creates a smoother narrative flow (especially when Jerry Grayson is running it) that depends upon making stuff up as you go. You never know when the players are going to try and eat feces off of an NPC; when they succeed, there's no Page 42 to turn to - you've gotta decide how much impact on the story that decision is going to have, on the fly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can see where hard-coding this necessary "making it up as you go" would be difficult for some groups, but personally I find it liberating and a lot more fun than trying to sift through rulebooks looking for footnotes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_217507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217507/#Comment_217507" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-09T11:02:49+00:00" title="July  9, 2009 11:02AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wonder if ity matters, or if it's a Bad Thing, that this leads to very localized play.

People were never in any Darwinian isolation unless they wanted to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nRafial - You are spot on that Old D+D didn't tell you how to modify it but they also didn't effectively tell you how to play it either so players had to make it up. In our case my brother Nate did the work. We bought the rule books when they came out but that just added to the make it up as you go along ethos because you could pick and choose which parts you wanted to add in. We never did use psionics for instance. I'm certain the freedom to make things up that D+D forced on you made becoming a game designer easier. I still like tinkering with RPGs that I run for my wife and brother Ian at the holidays.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne game I like to play at cons now is QAGS (Quick Ass Game System - from Hex Games). They use a mechanism called "Yum Yums" (candy) that you can throw at the game master and get to make up what happens in the game (though he may demand more yum yums for something big). They even explain at the start of the game that the dice are your enemy. To quote my brother (who runs the games) "The dice fucking hate you. They want you to fail. Don't trust them. If it's important use a yum yum." I know this is not a unique mechanic (heck it's what my games do except that nothing is automatic) but it's fun. The rules are simple so you could use yum yums to change but I never have. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a difference between teaking a game and making a game work in the first place. I have to say I don't like games that I have to invent myself to play. Even D+D basically worked without intervention sort of.<br/>\n<br/>\nChris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_217577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/edheil" title="edheil"><img alt="edheil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/edheil">edheil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217577/#Comment_217577" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-09T18:11:45+00:00" title="July  9, 2009  6:11PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can make up rules with arguments in Matrix Games?<br/><br/>My head just cracked open a little.<br/><br/>Sweet. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_217586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kaomera" title="kaomera"><img alt="kaomera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kaomera">kaomera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217586/#Comment_217586" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-09T19:35:55+00:00" title="July  9, 2009  7:35PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Posted By: VraithAnd Calvinball of course forms the missing Unstructured Rules quadrant.

If the Giant Pirate Robot Ninjas were totally annoying, you can drop them from the game with a minimum of fuss -- all it takes is a wince from the players, and the GM knows.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if you make up a new rule on the fly which, it turns out, interacts with other rules in a dysfunctional way, you need to explicitly remove that rule or modify it again, which may piss of the player who was counting on using that rules exploit.  <br/><br/>I am reminded of the awesome old board game, Cosmic Encounter, where every alien race gets to break one rule that everybody else has to follow!  The game came with a selection of alien races and there were expansion packs, but I don't recall people just making up their alien race and Exception to the Rule at the start of the game.  <br/><br/>There should be ways to formally structure creative rule-changing to keep it from breaking the game, though, and I'd like to see this implemented.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_217703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217703/#Comment_217703" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-10T12:50:18+00:00" title="July 10, 2009 12:50PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 11, 2009 9:37AM by Marshall Burns.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hm.

Just off the cuff, things like what does it mean that an Elf can act as both a fighter or a magic user, but not at the same time, or how exactly are scrolls used, or what spells does an M-U get to start, and how do they acquire new one, do you reroll hit dice at each new level, and ultimately what do you actually DO with those core six ability score apart from the little bit of interaction they have with the combat statistics.  (And answering "The GM makes a determination without recourse to dice" is only one possible answer, and not the only one that was made back in the day).<br/><br/>So I agree with you in that there is a lot of more explicit and playable procedure found in those books then is fashionable to grant (I was quite surprised myself when I sat down and read them how much is there), but I would also maintain that a form of rules drift would inevitably begin immediately as players applied their particular interpretations to various ambiguous passages.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
