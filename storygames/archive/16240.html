Small names are considered easy targets to be bullied when it comes to calling out the "cultural appropriation" battlecry. Bigger names and those among the "in-crowd" seem harder to target.<br/><br/>In short, I'm sick and tired of people claiming "cultural appropriation" whenever a new and interesting idea raises it's head.

DUDE. Thank you. I too get really sick of this, fast. For example, when one SG-er wanted tips for...I wanna say a D&amp;D game, where the PCs were basically colonizing orcs' land, people were up in arms about how he was de-humanizing native americans/aborigines, shitting on his ideas and calling them (and by extension him) "poisonous". And I just thought to myself, "Bullshit! No he isn't, he's just designing a game experience for his players which allows <i>them</i> to dehumanize the Orcs," which in this person's game were definitively people and not monsters, though they had their own set of values and traditions which made them entirely foreign to the PCs. <br/><br/>How is it a bad thing to explore dehumanization of "the other" in an in-game context? Isn't half the point of gaming to be able to make decisions you normally wouldn't, or wouldn't even be faced with? Isn't that what made the <i>Grand Theft Auto</i> series so popular? I mean, sure it may have been in poor taste, but isn't there some order of curiosity-satisfying catharsis to be found in gaming? Why are we even playing, otherwise?

By this point, Jason has written more than a few games, hacks, and scenarios about a variety of peoples, and it's probably fair to say he has a reputation for really doing the research. That doesn't make him "an expert" (whatever that means) or free from criticism, since you can still do the research and write about something in a messed-up fashion, but do I think most of his audience assumes a basic level of knowledge and intentionality in the way he writes about foreign historical situations, for better or worse.

Sorry.<br/><br/>I don't think there's anything wrong with using one's own culture or someone else's culture to explore social issues. Of course, the further you step from your own culture, the more careful you need to be to get it right, because getting wrong out of ignorance is ugly. <br/><br/>I generally have no problem with exploring difficult things in gaming. I just dislike when it's done sloppily, carelessly, or with naive ignorance of what's going on below the surface. <br/><br/>I think it'd be pretty sad if people stopped borrowing from real-world culture to enrich their games. Games would be poorer for it. Art always has something to say, and I think game design is art, and I think role-playing game play is a kind of art. <br/><br/>To get the Godwinisms out of the way, let me go there. I don't have to share my heritage with Jews to be outraged by the events of Nazi Germany; at the same time, I can't understand those events the same way a Jew can. Maybe playing a carefully constructed game about it can help me gain some small amount of understanding. Playing a badly constructed game could give me the wrong idea, and people (especially Jews) would have every right to be mad about such a game.<br/><br/>That said, I'm a middle-aged white American dude and I don't know much about the complications of cultural appropriation, and I'm eager to learn more about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_370419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370419/#Comment_370419" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-01T09:20:56+00:00" title="April  1, 2012  9:20AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

That doesn't happen here as frequently as other communities/sites that I've seen (including - actually almost exclusively- self-proclaimed "inclusive/safe" communities), but when I see it happen it ties my stomach in knots: Watching the destruction to fuel someone's personal power trip, powerless to call bullshit on it. <br/><br/>So I try to ensure that sort of degeneration doesn't happen here. And that the tools and language of Safety and Inclusion are kept sharp, for proper use (ie Not Status Games, almost always by North Americans, it's part of our online culture). You can only hit the fire alarm falsely too many times before people give up on trying to see a real fire. But I can only go so far, only work so fast, as the issues at heart require sensitivity, especially when sorting out the real from the bullshit.<br/><br/>Because there is a very real trend of cultural appropriation in media and gaming, it's good to be aware of it so that you can recognize clear examples, so that you can avoid it in your own work. If someone you respect calls it out, it's good to give them an earnest and empathetic listen, try to see what they are seeing. It's also good to be called on your potential transgressions, if you're unreflectedly perpetuating it without realizing it.<br/><br/>But again, in a world of American Monoculturalism, The Internet, Peer Impression and Status Games, there is a real threat to turn calls of cultural appropriation into another ignored false fire alarm (pulled for peer recognition and kudos, pulled for status games here or elsewhere). It's a difficult thing, and in my opinion (therefore "opinion of this site") you should err on the side of empathy rather than the side of casual dismissal.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>If you feel slighted in this regard or in future events on this kind of forum behavior, hit me up. I'll share your thoughts with the rest of the mod staff.<br/><br/>But, this thread is <b>KIND OF CLOSED</b>.<br/><br/>Some folks have some obvious pent up frustration/stuff they need to get off their chests regarding the past behaviors of others on this forum. It's healthy to do so! But let's find another outlet, not here. This isn't livejournal.<br/><br/>If you want to talk further on this subject in this thread, I'm only leaving one out:<br/><br/>* Take it to your blog (Blog, G+ post, Livejournal, Facebook, whatever)<br/>* And post a link to your thoughts/blog here in this thread.<br/>(this is not a dismissal!! ; I am trying to say that This Isn't The Place, while at the same time still allowing you the chance to bring people over to your private space to continue the discussion there, and get eyes on it)<br/><br/>Any further <b>public</b> (non-whisper) post in this thread that isn't a link/summary to your further discussion elsewhere (for any party) will be deleted.<br/><br/><b>EDIT:</b> (sorry, I forgot this point, apologies) If you are truly concerned with genuine cultural appropriation in the game Durance, <i><b>and are posting because you have real concerns</b></i>--and NOT because you want to "get back" at some assholes who used status games in the past by using the same ones back on them in public--then please create a new thread. Jason'll respond in kind, I'm sure. Contacting him in private is cool, too, but if you think it's worth discussing in public, go for it.<br/><br/>Thanks-<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
