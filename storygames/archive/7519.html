I simply do not like the idea of resolving player intention divorced from in-fiction character desire.  That came up a few times in The Roach game I was facilitating this weekend and each time it made me uncomfortable.  The only reason I didn't clamp down on it is because I was too tired to do so and the cases were minor.  If you want to know my feelings on the manner see the Character Advocacy sections of my <a href="http://playpassionately.wordpress.com" rel="nofollow">play passionately</a>  gaming blog.<br/><br/>Now that said, can someone give me a detailed break down of how exactly resolution in Houses of the Blooded works in terms of player-fiction relationship.  This really is a make or break thing for me, so be as concrete as possible.  What kinds of situations invoke the system?  What is established (fictionally) before the system is deployed?  What, if anything, fictionally does the system once deployed lock into place?  How are consequences moving forward decided?  That kind of stuff.<br/><br/>Oh, and I don't need all kinds of details about options and what not.  Just the basics.<br/><br/>Thanks.<br/><br/>Jesse                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166900/#Comment_166900" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-03T21:20:07+00:00" title="September  3, 2008  9:20PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse. The game can support your preference for player advocacy, but it by no means does that exclusively. You could play 100% for success and push hard for it. You could choose to take a more authorial stance and use privilege to decide how your character fails, if that were of interest to you as a player. The system, used in that way, is more about directing the narrative, and less about the PCs in-fiction desires. I know that's not your thing, but others find fun in doing that. The wager system allows you to add one fact per dice wagered to the fiction. Those facts generally stand, subject to veto for dickishness and tone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166908/#Comment_166908" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T00:32:35+00:00" title="September  4, 2008 12:32AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I get that I can drift the system, if I want but I'm wondering if there are aspects of the how the game plays that means I don't have to.

Insofar as I can discern, the stuff about "rolling to lose" is there as a half-formed vestigial thought perhaps cribbed from some other game, with no real impact on anything else. If it were me, I'd toss it and have dice rolls represent straightforward advocacy of character best interests in the way you describe. (As far as I can guess, the reason for this thing in the first place is that the game wants to encourage full-body dramatism from the entire group; it's a bit top-down in that you first need to sell the stance to the players and only then will the mechanic be at all relevant. Unfortunately there's a slew of other mechanics that become happily irrelevant if the players take narrative fun seriously like that.)<br/><br/>Of course, I'm sure that somebody out there has latched on this particular rule and considers it central to the play experience; if so, I'd love to hear about it, even if it's not my cup of tea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jbuchert" title="jbuchert"><img alt="jbuchert" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jbuchert">jbuchert</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166923/#Comment_166923" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T05:40:13+00:00" title="September  4, 2008  5:40AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 4, 2008 5:40AM by jbuchert.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interestingly, you can see the same kind of thing hidden in the roll-and-keep system of L5R and 7th Sea. The player rolls a set number of die and keeps the ones she wants - you don't need to keep the ones guaranteeing success and instead you could go for failure. Just like Eero mentioned though, in most cases you'd have to sell it to your players beforehand to see it happen in game.

You cannot add something as a wager that would require a contested risk.  With privilege you decide if you succeed and add details to the scene.  It seems to me that John wants you to wonder what the other players are going to do with that power the same way you wonder what a GM might do in another game.  This multiplies the tension and engages the players in a way that I have seen in few games.  <br/><br/>As an aside, this game solves what was a central problem for me with Amber Diceless (players tending to go off on their own and play in a corner of shadow).  My players jump on contested risks even when they're not around in character especially Wisdom and Cunning risks (these tell you what you know and what you discover).  <br/><br/>So to shorten my answer both of your examples could happen to you character if you have privilege.  It is up to you what you choose to do with that power.  My son really hates thinking like a hippy gamer so he has his character always succeeding at his intentions with privilege and only rarely uses wagers (except to injure people).  My wife likes a deeply political game so she puts her character in these convoluted and difficult situations.  They both play the same game at the same time and get something very different (and personally enjoyable) out of it.  To me this is very, very cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166961/#Comment_166961" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T08:51:43+00:00" title="September  4, 2008  8:51AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Jesse, considering it's your privilege to do with as you like, you could always use it for character advocacy whenever you play, even when you play with others who have other preferences.

It was pretty standard fare, however, such as an etiquette roll or something.<br/><br/>So, instead of just rolling along, I took a whole heap of raises (like five or six) and thus raised the target number by a lot, but if I succeeded I would do it pretty amazingly (that's my quick run-down for those unfamiliar with the mechanics). In effect, I as the player said "I don't care to succeed in this roll unless I do it spectacularly". I didn't see much impact in just succeeding so I went for a different route. That was, however, a player level decision, not something my character decided to do (she didn't give a rat's ass about what was happening, in fact).<br/><br/>Just out of curiosity, would you find that kind of player decision making on rolling strategy as equally negative as the direct privilege mechanic?<br/><br/>Joachim Buchert                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167020/#Comment_167020" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T11:36:27+00:00" title="September  4, 2008 11:36AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My thoughts on the character advocacy issue are many layered and a lot of it has to do with the social "vibe" at the table I want to promote.

The game facilitates and encourages this by having lots of fiction pointing to that direction, basically. In a sense it's a propaganda trick - you get Ambition, Love and Revenge by telling the players that that's what it's about and then giving them enough narrative power to narrate whatever they want into it, including those things. Provided that you laid the groundwork correctly, the players themselves fulfill the promise. It's like Vampire in that sense; tell the players emphatically enough that your game is about lofty drama, and they might do just that, regardless of what the game's system encourages.<br/><br/>Which is to say that I wouldn't whole-heartedly recommend Houses of the Blooded simply because somebody liked to have those things appear in their game - if it's important to you that Ambition, Love and Revenge rise naturally from the motivations of the characters, Houses of the Blooded does very little to ensure this. On the other hand, if you need a spark of inspiration and are willing to pour in the Ambition, Love and Revenge in the form of your own character narrative, then you're playing the game the way it's intended. The best way to phrase this is perhaps that the designer will be glad if you decide to appreciate his aesthetic and play the way he intends, even if there is little in the game to structure or encourage such.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167102/#Comment_167102" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T16:30:34+00:00" title="September  4, 2008  4:30PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, I think you're overlooking some pretty neat little mechanics that do prod ambition and love into the spotlight.

The seasonal actions also become a ton easier when you're married, which makes love that much closer to center stage.  I haven't read the GM advice, but if it doesn't tell the GM to hammer on the marriage and love themes, and to provoke players to revenge (and confront them with same), I'd be hugely surprised.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167107/#Comment_167107" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T16:48:47+00:00" title="September  4, 2008  4:48PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Plus you get all those bonus dice and aspects when you are on a Revenge or a Romance, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167117/#Comment_167117" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T17:22:47+00:00" title="September  4, 2008  5:22PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also Revenge and Romance let you break the social laws that normally would make certain actions in the pursuit of Love or Revenge difficult (and can be used to further ambitious goals).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167121/#Comment_167121" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T17:30:34+00:00" title="September  4, 2008  5:30PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On a non-mechanics level, the setting basically boils down to Ambition, Love and Revenge.

(The other option seems to be very highly cooperative dramatism in the service of fulfilling the setting description.) I don't know if an adversial game with "Ambition, Love and Revenge" as strategic playing pieces rather than story theme is what Jesse is interested in.<br/><br/>But it's probably best to let that stand as one reader's experience, offered in case Jesse might find it useful - I don't have any particular need to prove to one and all that Houses of the Blooded is somehow flawed, especially as I think that it's the clearest verbalization of Wick's play style that I've seen, warts and all. A very honest and interesting book from that viewpoint, and one that I think has lots to offer to those who played through the last decade's designs from Alderac, Whitewolf and other such publishers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167193/#Comment_167193" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-05T05:09:51+00:00" title="September  5, 2008  5:09AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>I think there is a bit more going on there with the system than ya might think.

My comment wasn't meant to suggest there was a system-setting incoherence. I think the system backs up the setting rather well, encouraging duels, insults, intrigue, backstabbing, romance and revenge...I think the system and the setting stuff complement each other nicely. Frex, clothing is important in Ven culture, with different colors carrying very important meaning. In the mechanics your clothing can give you mechanical benefit.

I'll try to explain that throw-away comment in short:\n<ul>\n<li>Relentless censure: The way I read it, Houses of the Blooded shares the typically '90s notion that you get players to make the correct kind of fiction by schooling them into it with lots of fluff (to be read, appreciated and emulated) and a concept of "good roleplaying" shared by the play group and used to create social pressure that keeps players in line. One might say that the game designer has precreated a vision of what sort of things the game is about (theoryspeak: theme-focused simulationism), and the game book's job is to transmit the vision and the tools the group can use to cohere themselves around that vision, managing to replicate it faithfully.</li>\n<li>Narration resolution: The original topic of this thread touches on how the players in HotB are not supposed to be advocating for the true interests of their characters, but rather they should be objective storytellers who share responsibilities for creating a story to the preagreed standards; that's why players get narrative authority in the game, while characters only rarely or not at all get their way, unless explicitly so allowed by a player at the table. Effectively, it's about passing a conch to determine which player gets a turn to shape the narrative, like <i>Once Upon a Time</i> and a slew of other games since then. As far as I understand the goals of the game, the reason for using narration resolution is that it allows players to conflict over characterization of characters and preplanned plots (made by players and characters) - the rules are there to determine whose plans for the game go through. This is very familiar to me from Amber and some other games that share extensive character backstory and some other bits with HotB.</li>\n<li>90's movement of game design: From the viewpoint of somebody with relatively little exposure to these games, it seems to me that games like Vampire (and pretty much all other WW games), Deadlands, 7th Sea and probably a whole lot of others as well (I haven't read or played very many of these, so I won't try to guess on which games might belong in the group), all share to some degree of the same qualities I'm seeing in Houses of the Blooded. I found Houses of the Blooded to be a very clear and inspiring example of the priorities of play evidenced in all of the above titles, while Wick also did a good job of illuminating the style and techniques related to it. Wick explicitly recognizes the struggle between simulationistic and gamistic priorities evident in these games, and tries to resolve it by the means of explicit social contract; meanwhile, the game rules themselves continue to strive for a seamless combination of rules that control player input with rules that inspire it, continuing the tradition of rules-incoherence (and, one assumes, practical rules-drift) from the '90s. I'll be interested in seeing what sort of responses Wick's work (which I consider substantial within its frame) will generate in its intended audience.</li>\n</ul>Again, I might just not know what I'm discussing here. The '90s style of game design all but skipped my personal experience at the time, as the Finnish countryside spent most of the decade happily playing '80s games such as Runequest, Call of Cthulhu and Paranoia. My personal play experience of these games is really slim, even if I've read some titles such now and then. In general I've been impressed by the passion these writers bring into their fluff, but the actual rules-sets seem to have little to do with transforming player interaction and lots with orthogonal simulation of the in-fiction reality - an approach that I find relatively dull and confusing myself.<br/><br/>Even more significantly, I don't really feel any need to contest my impression with anybody who happens to love this sort of game. So nobody needs to come and prove me wrong just to win the Internet. I'm sure that the huge heritage of gaming that Houses of the Blooded represents includes much depth and value, if you happen to get excited by that sort of thing.

So, if you and I get involved in a duel, and at the resolution, you have two wagers and I have one, it could go like this.<br/><br/>YOU: (w/privilege) I lose the duel! (You now decide who spends their first wager. You decide it is going to be you.)<br/>YOU: (first wager) AND I am hauled off to jail.<br/>ME: (first and last wager) AND you lose respect in your lover's eyes.<br/>YOU: AND she thinks you are a cowardly brute.<br/><br/>Or, it could go like this.<br/><br/>YOU: (w/privilege) I lose the duel. (You now decide that I spend the first wager.)<br/>ME (first and last wager): AND you get hauled off to jail.<br/>YOU: (first wager) And my lover cries for my loss<br/>YOU: (second wager) And she thinks you are a brute.<br/><br/>Now, because I know you want a certain outcome, I can use my wager to give you what YOU want. As the Narrator, I'd give that player a Style Point for helping another player accomplish what he wants for his character while sacrificing his own wager. That's Good Form.<br/><br/>Wagers allow everybody to say "Yes, and" or "Yes, but."

This goes against the established habits of many; its fundamentally opposite to the model of roleplaying that's developed out the dominant Forge strain of narrativist games, wherein the role of the player is to provide a voice for their own character's independent desires and protagonism. A game that explicitly says that your character is supposed to be a protagonist, but he really has no rights to advocation by anybody at the table (that is, nobody is responsible for advocating his interests), has a very different social mechanic going on as regards story creation. I don't know that I'm right or wrong in my personal interpretation, but to me the game reads like you're supposed to pretty much play the director and script motions for your own character to go through without making a vicarious commitment to taking his side yourself. It's like a given player is committed to play a given <i>story</i> instead of a given character, and the conflict rules are there to find out whether we play the story I have in mind or the one you have in mind.<br/><br/>Jesse's example illustrates the fine line that can be found between a player advocating for a character and a player advocating for a story: his favorable example has the character achieve the thing he really, truly wants out of the situation, while the other example has the player undermine his character in every conceivable way - so instead of being the character's advocate, he's just using the character as a tool of his story.<br/><br/>(Not saying that this is fundamentally a problem and that all games should work the same way or anything like that; it's just how I understood Jesse's original query set-up. I also realize that the game's not really written within a paradigm where there is just one right way to play and read it - it's just that we need to read some sort of game into the text when we read it, and that is the interpretation that I see as the most natural and dominant one.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170426/#Comment_170426" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-21T19:54:35+00:00" title="September 21, 2008  7:54PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 21, 2008 7:55PM by Jesse.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What I mean by "preferred social dynamic" is what I've extrapolated from your GM Advice in various sources: 7th Sea GM Guide, Play Dirty, your LJ, etc.<br/><br/>With regards to my example here is what I'm talking about Eero has the right of it here:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite><br/>Jesse's example illustrates the fine line that can be found between a player advocating for a character and a player advocating for a story: his favorable example has the character achieve the thing he really, truly wants out of the situation, while the other example has the player undermine his character in every conceivable way - so instead of being the character's advocate, he's just using the character as a tool of his story.</blockquote>\nHere's what I believe.  Playing from the point of view of character advocacy preserves tension in the fiction but removes tension at the social level.  You declare your character's intention.  I declare my character's intention.  No tension because you and I are the sole arbitrators of what our character's want.  If these intentions are in conflict that produces tension in the fiction but there is still no tension at the social level because whether the intentions are in conflict or not is fairly objective.  Finally, the system is deployed and it tells us whose intention wins out.  The consequences of that inform our next declaration of intentions and so on.  Thus story is an unpredictable and uncontrollable by product of these clashes.<br/><br/>This is not to say that we can pick character intentions at total random and AWESOME will happen.  That's bunk.  Quality input produces quality output.  Crap input produces crap output.  This is about processing the input in a non-socially tense matter. <br/><br/>To move things from the character level to the player level introduces all kinds of social dodges and manipulations that create a social dynamic where story is something someone *makes* happens or forces into the fiction by wrestling over the Privilege stick or endless negotiations about exact outcomes when using Stakes in PtA.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170483/#Comment_170483" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-22T09:15:35+00:00" title="September 22, 2008  9:15AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But Jesse, you make decisions for your character that are not in their best interests all the time \u2014 just not, as far as I can remember, when you're actually rolling dice.

Or rather, I'm pretty certain that its rules do not actually prevent that sort of play, among a range of other interpretations. HoB is written in an (I'd like to think) intentionally flexible manner, so it's up to the group to decide how they do things. As we established at the beginning of the thread already, you <i>can</i> decide to preserve your character's intent in every challenge, without ever narrating against him. The <i>rules</i> do not prevent that, but the <i>instructions</i>, insofar as I understand them, do advocate a kind of play where you put the good of the story (in the dramaturgical sense) first and decide on your character's success accordingly. That's why the option is emphasized, it seems to me.<br/><br/>Interestingly enough, "choosing to suck" can happen on many levels and mean many things. In HoB it's the player who chooses for his character to suck because he thinks that brings about more interesting events; in <i>Dust Devils</i> the character chooses to suck because he knows that pulling his guns would win him the battle, but the sheriff would then never trust him again. These events have very different meanings for what you're doing in the game, even if in both cases it's the player making "non-optimal" choices for his character. (Non-optimal in scare quotes because in truth that latter choice <i>is</i> optimal: it's more important for the character to gain the trust of the sheriff than win the fight.)<br/><br/>(Also: I'm sorry if it looks like I'm hogging this thread or something. I just came out of a game design wherein I did a lot of hard thinking about the topic of player-character relationship, so I'm interested in this stuff in other games, too.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Houses of The Blooded: Privledge - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7519/houses-of-the-blooded-privledge/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Houses of The Blooded: Privledge - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7519/houses-of-the-blooded-privledge/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Josh, you make a good point.

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Josh, you make a good point.  Eero's answer is a really big point of it.  When I play "In A Wicked Age..." I tend to play it dice blind.  I just follow my instincts regarding what I think the character wants and if he ends up on the We Owe list then that says one thing and if doesn't then that says another.  Same with My Life with Mater and its Epilogue conditions.  <br/><br/>Character Advocacy isn't about doing what is objectively BEST for the character given our outside bird's eye view, it's about following the character's passions as you perceive them to their "inevitable" conclusion.  That includes their passions suddenly changing direction if something in the fiction so moves you.<br/><br/>On the flip side I'm not saying I don't ever take the mechanics into account AT ALL.  If I'm playing Sorcerer and notice that my Humanity is 2, I might think it's time to do something Humanity Gain worthy but I don't *force* the issue if I can't find a place in my conception of the character's passions to fit it in.<br/><br/>Another aspect is that I don't mind collaboration or collusion on badness in the character's life right up to the point of conflict.  Spione's Maneuvers &amp; Flashpoint represents the cycle of my thinking very well.  During Maneuvers anyone may contribute anything Adverse, Beneficial or Otherwise but come Flashpoints Adversary and Advocate are fixed and required.  Similarly some of the best parts of Sorcerer feel like everyone is placing paper dolls into a scene on the verge of motion right before you hit the "GO" button and watch the fallout.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20Wick" title="John Wick"><img alt="John Wick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20Wick">John Wick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170567/#Comment_170567" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-22T16:51:45+00:00" title="September 22, 2008  4:51PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you guys may be assigning priorities to me that I don't have.<br/><br/>The game doesn't tell players to put story in front of character, nor have I ever advocated a STORY BEATS CHARACTER approach. I think both are crucial elements to success. One doesn't trump the other; they have to work together to create a good story.<br/><br/>Houses doesn't advocate a STORY BEATS CHARACTER approach, either. You can use the system with your character as a priority or the story as a priority or both. I don't find these things mutually exclusive.<br/><br/><i>This goes against the established habits of many; its fundamentally opposite to the model of roleplaying that's developed out the dominant Forge strain of narrativist games, wherein the role of the player is to provide a voice for their own character's independent desires and protagonism.</i><br/><br/>Well, since I can't find any reason to believe that G/N/S is anything but a three-sided box to think inside, I guess that's why I missed it. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike" title="Steerpike"><img alt="Steerpike" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/73053145/4961238"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike">Steerpike</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170573/#Comment_170573" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-22T17:44:28+00:00" title="September 22, 2008  5:44PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse, I dunno if this will help but here is my view on Privilege  - use it to get what you want for the character. Seriously.  Most of the time you are going to be playing hard for success, and curse every complication the GM wins with his wagers. And sometimes you want your character to fail, but in failure accomplish something else by using wagers to get it - like you try to discover something, but instead find something else.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut sometimes, the story becomes more important and you want your Ven to fail, and by fail I mean fail in a big, Epic, Ven way. Get Privilege and then you get to make sure that instead of a random failure that the GM narrates you get to narrate the end of your characters opera/pillow book. Like in Polaris how only you get to decide when you character dies. This is the basically same concept.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end it is just another tool in the kit for telling some kick ass Ven stories.

That seems to contradict the idea that you can narrate failure to get your intention as the first effect. I'm still making my way through the book, but the text seems pretty clear that you state your intentions, gather dice, make wagers, roll and the winner gets their intention. And, it says players state <i>their </i>intentions. Not players state their character's intention, or somesuch that would allow for player and PC intention to differ.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20Wick" title="John Wick"><img alt="John Wick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20Wick">John Wick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171187/#Comment_171187" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-25T07:51:29+00:00" title="September 25, 2008  7:51AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You state your <i>intention</i>, but then, if you win Privilege, you get to say whether or not you <i>get</i> your intention and how it happens.<br/><br/>Intention: I want to convince you that your wife and I are not having a secret affair.<br/>(roll)<br/>Privilege (me): I fail in my intention.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171229">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171229/#Comment_171229" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-25T10:25:22+00:00" title="September 25, 2008 10:25AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Interestingly enough, "choosing to suck" can happen on many levels and mean many things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>These events have very different meanings for what you're doing in the game, even if in both cases it's the player making "non-optimal" choices for his character.

Building on that (or maybe just looking at it from another angle):<br/><br/>It's entirely conceivable that the best way to explore an issue using a character's perspective is for that character to make a choice that is sub-optimal in terms of accomplishing the character's goals.  If your idea of the key core of the fun of roleplaying involves strategizing from the character's point of view, this looks wonky.  But if your idea of the key core of the fun is more concerned with creating stories that tell you something about how the character views their world, then "optimal choices" may mean something more like "making choices that create a certain kind of story" -- optimal from the player's point of view but not necessarily from the character's.<br/><br/>There are really two variables there -- one about whether you'd rather strategize or explore perspectives, and another one about whether you'd rather do it from the character's perspective or from a System-level meta-perspective.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171255/#Comment_171255" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-25T11:53:13+00:00" title="September 25, 2008 11:53AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For what it's worth my ideas concerning Character Advocacy have nothing to do with strategizing.  In fact, all I've ever said is that something somewhere must represent and stand up for the character's interests.  They don't even have to fight all that hard.  For example, in Primetime Adventures all I say is that Stakes are best suited to representing the character's goals.  I don't say, "And then the player should spend every ounce of his fan mail on it."  If the player is not invested in success his obligation ends with him stating what he believe's the character wants for Stakes and taking his Screen Presence worth of cards.   He can spend fan mail on the GM's behalf for all I care.<br/><br/>Privledge violates this organizational principal where NOTHING is representing the character's interests.

One I think is actually a rather vital social organization tool.  And works just as I described in my previous post.  If you go to the bottom of this page:<br/><br/><a href="http://playpassionately.wordpress.com/concepts-from-elsewhere/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://playpassionately.wordpress.com/concepts-from-elsewhere/</a><br/><br/>you'll see a quote about stakes in Primetime Adventures that I think explains the social organizational element.<br/><br/>The second issue is really a matter of my personal preferences and I think is less vital.  I like to keep my characters close to home.  I like to care for and feel sympathy for my characters as if they are real people.  Thus I am likely NOT to spend fan mail on the GM's behalf because I am that committed to my characters as people with worth while goals, beliefs and passions.  At minimum I don't try very hard for success if my commitment to the conflict at hand is very low but I almost never actively undermine my character.  I prefer to play with people who share this connection with their characters.<br/><br/>Edited Note: And all this applies only in the moment of conflict and crisis.  I often take a very gleeful roll in *establishing* those moments of conflict and crisis.  This isn't about keeping my character out of harms way.  It's about standing up for him when harm arrives, even harm I've engineered myself.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171263/#Comment_171263" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-25T12:13:46+00:00" title="September 25, 2008 12:13PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool!

This is not the only technique to get themeful play, but it's a popular one. Having your own character intentionally lose a conflict signals that we're not really contesting a matter between the characters; you could just give up if that were the case. Instead, that sort of resolution procedure seems to be pointed towards (among other things, I'm sure) resolving player-level disagreements about where the story should go. Advocacy-based play rarely has this sort of player-level planning in the first place, as players are willing to let the chips fall where they may, in the interest of giving their characters complete protagonism (that is, freedom of choice).<br/><br/>Please do let us know what you think of HoB, Jesse; I found it a multi-faceted, ambitious work myself, so I'm interested in what others think of it, too.

Although it depends on what you mean by "setting up things you want to see later."  I'm *strongly* against engineering failure in this conflict so that I can do this other thing later.
