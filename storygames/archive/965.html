                            As I see it, I'm more and more on the 'mistery' side these days. I remember fondly my first RQ book, a sleek and beautiful thing chocked full of awesome rules, and vague hints of a Mythical Earth... and a map of Glorantha without any explanation. I remember dearly the sense of wonder when reading the 1st ed. of Vampire, full of possibilities.<br/><br/>I like detailed worlds, mind you. But I like the detail when is gradually added, and changes with time, and always lets those blank spaces in the map so you can do with them what you want.<br/><br/>Who I'm I trying to deceive? I like detail the way Gliorantha does.                        </div>

                            Thanks, you have helped to resolve a question I had: Should I prepare an exhaustive map for my new game?<br/><br/>The answer I came to is "no". However, I may possibly do a non-detailed one.                        </div>

                            There should, however, be at least three things on the map which have very evocative names, but which are not explained anywhere in the text.<br/>

Likewise, the text should mention at least three things which are not on the map.                        </div>

                            Thanks, Fred. Duly noted.<br><br>Though I'll probably have to put a disclaimer somewhere on the lines of "This page intentionally left blank", or the nitpickers will get me.<br/><br/>EDIT: Actually I don't need to mention anything on the map in the text at all. The game is called City of Masks (based in the same setting as my novel of that name, it's an evocative setting and I thought I could get more mileage out of it that way), so a map is probably implied, but for the game (or the novel) the locations, even their relative position, don't really matter. They're scenery for the real action, which is the characters' relationships with each other and with the groups that hold power (each of which has a headquarters, though). Nothing is going to depend on how quickly you can get from the palace to the harbour.<br/><br/>Actually, perhaps I <i>don't</i> need a map. Hmmm.                        </br></br></div>

                            A map serves more functions than measuring distance.  They establish what locations are important.  They can imply relationships.  An artistic (rather than technical) map can provide lots of nonverbal color that many people find valuable.  Speaking as a former cartographer, don't dismiss the idea of including a map too quickly.                        </div>

                            When back in the day I bought Runequest 2nd edition it came with a fairly detailed map of Glorantha, or a bit of Glorantha anyway.<br/><br/>None of it was explained, stuff had names like Dragon Pass and Devil's Tower and Snakepipe Hollow, all utterly unexplained.<br/><br/>It was seriously cool.  My group, we'd look at the map, get buzzed by a name and the party would go there and whoever was GMing would make up something based on the name.<br/><br/>Then all the details got filled in, it turned out there were extensive gazetteers for every one of those locations, the map stopped being fun at that point.<br/><br/>But until then, Vaxalon has the right of it, few things are cooler than a map with unexplained details (though nowadays I'd say explicitly you meant to do that, gamers are less forgiving now than in the early 1980s).                        </div>

                            I definitely like maps, and no doubt, I like having unexplained things on the map. But I disagree that having gazeteers for places on the map is bad. The trick I think is that the gazeteer has to add more unexplained things. And it needs to give you lots of bits and pieces that you can glue together. RQ got a LOT more cool after Cults of Prax was introduced. And the Snake Pipe Hollow module didn't kill the potential of that location, because, while it gave you some clue about what was there, it also showed a bunch of cave entrances, and provided you with detail for one of those entrances. And the cave it gave you had it's own unexplained bits.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I think there is a limit to how much gazeteer information is actually useable. Of course the problem is that everyone wants a gazeteer for the part of the world they're interested in. I'm bummed we never got much gazeteer information for Dragon Pass given how central it seemed to the world, meanwhile we got all this information on Prax, but that was also kind of hard to use because it was all about working for the occupying force (well at least the Borderlands box that I got way back when, it wasn't until recently that I got Pavis and Big Rubble which aren't so dependant on working for the Lunars). So I guess my problem is that the original rules sort of aimed players at playing Sartarite barbarians, but then all the subsequent source material bent away from that.<br/>
