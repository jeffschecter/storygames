Some games are better at that than others.  Crunchier games, in that context, would benefit from prep or pre-generated characters and situation.

This is such an obvious specialty of the game that I'm actually bragging here. Getting a whole game done under an hour is not impossible with three players who know the rules.

This was my first experience with Speed Gaming and I haven't been able to find examples of it being tried anywhere else (but I'd like to!). As you can see from the brochure, there were a lot of different game systems used - most of them traditional - and a couple more added too late for the brochure. Each "slot" was one hour long and the coordinator literally blew a whistle and players went to their next table each hour. It ran incredibly well and everyone had a blast!<br/><br/>What I did for Story Games was play about 10 minutes of "Yes, but..." to create the world and character and then transitioned to <a href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/xcart/product.php?productid=16280&amp;cat=0&amp;bestseller" rel="nofollow">PTA</a>. I made sure everyone framed one scene and had one conflict. I had a max of four players. I primed the Audience Pool with 5 chips and I had a budget of 10. We actually finished the pilot episode most of the time.

I had to "practice" my demo a few times before I really got the flow down.<br/><br/>Another thing to consider is that those 15 minute demos are designed to sell the game, not necessarily to provide a real "play experience". With many games, it's simply impossible to show off everything the game has to offer in such a short time span.<br/><br/>But still, I agree that if all you want is a "taste", an hour kinda seems long. I think 30-40 minute demos would work pretty well for that purpose, allowing for 6-8 games over a 4-hour period.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_199067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199067/#Comment_199067" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-27T07:50:58+00:00" title="March 27, 2009  7:50AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We need more games that play and wrap in an hour.

Fortunately, the answer is the same too - intensity and focus!<br/><br/>If you think about it, a lot of convention games are already short games - you can't play a <a href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/xcart/product.php?productid=16163&amp;cat=0&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">"With Great Power..."</a> story arc in four hours. Anything <a href="http://burningempires.com/" rel="nofollow">"Burning Empires"</a> is a one-manuever-sample of a much larger game. Even PTA, which fits nicely into four hours, is a sample since you aren't playing through the spotlight episodes of each character the group creates.<br/><br/>After actually playing and GMing like this I want to do it again (and so do a lot of other folks here). Not because I'm selling or recruiting or anything, but because it was a lot of fun!<br/><br/>Another benefit was that people could show up and play for an hour and not have a longer committment than that. Okay, that sounds ridiculous to me too, but the appeal of that was huge. We got far better turnout than I would have predicted. Some people were trying out our community group, some were trying out each other looking for players and GMs they could play with, some were trying out the game systems they were interested in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_199273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moleculo" title="moleculo"><img alt="moleculo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/874/n4G37MA34HKP8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moleculo">moleculo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199273/#Comment_199273" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-29T06:14:51+00:00" title="March 29, 2009  6:14AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting. I could easily see suggesting such an idea for one of Endgame's mini-cons in Oakland, CA (the latest just wrapped yesterday). Four-hour sessions, very story-gamer friendly crowd... I think it could work with the right mix of games. As for the "what's the appeal?" line of thinking, my take is (per usual, an analogy) it's like dim sum or tapas. Small, intense, flavorful servings - eat it, enjoy it, move on. It would be a very different experience than a languid seven-course pair the wine correctly event. <br/><br/>As a forty-something father of two younguns with a busy career, I've turned to no- or low-prep games pretty much out of necessity but also because they suit my style of play. And I enjoy the challenge of finding the hook for a character really quickly, trying to jump into the driver's seat at a moment's notice and make something meaningful happen. You'd definitely need the right kind (in terms of taste and experience) of players for this sort of thing but I'm thinking they'd self-select. Want to warn off the first-time gamer, probably.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: whiteknife</cite>I've used 3:16 in a similar context to this and it's worked just fine.

This version lacks the cool and evocative art of the paper version but is totally playable.  Besides being available for free, or quite reasonably-priced on paper, it has a sterling pedigree.  It was written by John Tynes (Unknown Armies, Delta Green), which has to count in its favor.  It was one of the first games, if not <i>the</i> first game, to take fortune-free resolution seriously, and formal experiments from Puppeland keep showing up elsewhere \u2014 if you thought My Life With Master's "More/Less Than Human" mechanic was cool, why not check out its source, and see what other treasure is buried there?  <br/><br/>The rules are mostly some sentences on the character sheet; there are three global rules, which can be explained in fifteen seconds.  Players don't have to read the rules; you can teach them quicker than most people can turn a page.  A session can be prepped (including chargen) in five minutes, and takes precisely one hour to play (it is in the rules!).  It's hard to be faster than that.<br/><br/>I've run plenty of sessions of CoC where we never clicked, never got invested in our guys, and just played it out because we felt obligated to do so.  This has never happened in Puppetland, a game that has unfailingly gotten my playgroups into the zone for at least part of each session.  You know the zone I'm talking about \u2014 like when you first start studying judo, and you muscle your way through some techniques for a few weeks, and then one day you get your grip, step into your opponent, and everything falls into place and you effortlessly put him right on his shoulders and BAM! you're actually doing judo, instead of stumbling around on the tatami without a clue.  Puppetland is like that.<br/><br/>Incidentally, I LARP Puppetland.  Normally, when I think I might run it, I show up with a bag of actual puppets and have folks choose one.
