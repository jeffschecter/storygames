I was thinking about multiple reasons that it might be manifesting, but it occurred to me that some games are pretty unfriendly to blacks... and who knows, maybe I'll come across some asian unfriendly ones too.<br/><br/>First one, D&amp;D. Traditional western fantasy is already white centric, it's got such language as white knights and black hearted - an idea that the lighter your skin, the more pure you are, and the darker the more corrupt you are. That as a start might make some blacks uncomfortable, but Drow take it to another level. Here you've got a race of people who are immediately identifiable as evil based purely on their skin colour, which is apparently a representation of how evil they are inside/a punishment for being evil. I imagine if I were black, I wouldn't like hearing that. Take it a step further, the general consensus is that good Drow PCs are unwelcome in games - maybe it's because people don't like good Drow Rangers who specialise in scimitars, but still there's some implication that Drow are supposed to remain the evil race, that they're inherently evil and can't possibly be good. There are some other examples, but I think that's the most pointed one. I figure in addition to blacks who just don't feel their culture is represented well in fantasy RPGs and therefore wouldn't be that interested in them, there are some who might have tried it out and decided to head elsewhere once they run into some concrete manifestations of black is evil stereotypes.<br/><br/>Vampire's another example. Mainly due to being strongly associated with goth culture. Goth aesthetics pretty much exclude blacks - you're going for pasty white skin with black makeup (which acts as a strong contrast to the pasty white skin). If you're black I suppose you could just go the black leather and spiked collar route, but it's not something I've ever seen. Although I'm sure there are a few exceptions somewhere. There's nothing in the setting that's particularly exclusive, but I also don't think there's much that's particularly inviting either.<br/><br/>That's 2 of the top 5 RPGs (I'd say top 2, but Vampire at <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> might be arguable) that aren't set to attract blacks, and even have some elements that drive them away. There's also something of a further unfortunate effect this might have. White supremacy isn't accepted anymore, the KKK keep their identities secret (at least to my knowledge anyway), so if you're xenophobic, you'd have to find some other group. Even if you're not with like minded xenophobic people, if you see a group that coincidentally doesn't have any of the people you dislike, you might gravitate towards it. This isn't just random speculation - I've seen it happen with MMA, a sport that coincidentally was white dominated for a while, happened to get a bunch of white supremacists following it because it happened to not have many black people in it, unlike football and basketball. <br/><br/>So I'm thinking it might be something entirely different and specific to SG, or it could be that it's more to do with the hobby in general, that it has some conditions that could attract people with bigoted attitudes, and that it comes out in some subtle fashion in discussions.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330531/#Comment_330531" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-17T21:10:17+00:00" title="June 17, 2011  9:10PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Our cultures are racist, and we're product of our cultures. <br/>Gaming doesn't intercept that or prevent it whatsoever.

I think it's probably safe to say that it's more based on the people designing the games not knowing much about Asia and its different nations and cultures rather than any malicious intent, but it's not going to be all that appealing or welcoming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330550/#Comment_330550" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-17T23:13:56+00:00" title="June 17, 2011 11:13PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: T-Boy</cite>Seriously?<br/><br/>This isn't<a href="https://bankuei.wordpress.com/2010/09/10/gamers-and-self-segregation/" rel="nofollow">news</a>, people.</blockquote>\nI'll try to be charitable here, and just ask.

In particular the reason people don't want good drow in their games is because it usually indicates a Drizz't fanboy (not sure about the number of Zs). It's an objection to an extremely specific character type more than anything else. The OP does hint at that, but I think that is actually pretty much the entire reason for that one. Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. I'm not commenting there on images of drow more widely.<br/><br/>Regarding Vampire I don't think it's the core book that's the issue. It's the supplements and spinoff lines. I'd single out Kindred of the East (mentioned above), Gypsies obviously, the Italian vamps as noted, basically VtM works heavily on stereotypes and that has its inevitable issues. Werewolf too is a bit iffy. <br/><br/>JD has a point that much of gaming is derived from the pulps, and the pulps were hands down straightforwardly racist. Like he says, we can still love them but that doesn't mean we accept them uncritically.<br/><br/>To be honest I suspect the issue is more one of invisibility than these particular games. How much gaming art includes characters who are black where their being black is not somehow part of that character's concept? How often if a scenario needs a guy the PCs contact for info is he a Rajinder Patel rather than a John Harris? Unless, of course, his ethnicity is again integral to his concept? How often does Astroman take off his crime fighting mask to reveal his secret identity as Jim Woo? Unless, of course, Astroman's powers are somehow related to something Chinese.<br/><br/>I'd suggest that invisibility is a greater issue than evil elves having black skin. If the iconic character illustrations in a game included a black PC (which in D&amp;D they might for all I know) that would I think be more important than allowing the odd good drow.<br/><br/>But then of course there's the risk of tokenism and condescension. Tricky stuff. That said, I do think there's a real danger in saying things like " I imagine if I were black, I wouldn't like hearing that" which is ultimately a form of appropriating someone else's experience, however well meaning. If we want to know what someone black might think and we are not ourselves black, we have to ask someone who is black, and then realise that the answer we get is representative of nothing more than that person anyway. <br/><br/>Put another way, you could imagine (if you're not Scottish) how someone Scottish would feel about a particular image or representation (say Fat Bastard in the Myers' films).

Accordingly, he chose for his protagonists to be British in appearance.  This includes the elves who became fair skinned accordingly.<br/>2) The reversal of colourations for the Drow (white with dark hair =&gt; black with white hair) is a reasonable approach for the inverted mockeries of the original race.  It the same way, the orks were specifically corrupted reversals of Elves so had different appearance.<br/>3) The Drow, as plot inversions of the Tolkien Elves, were evil.  No surprise.<br/>4) Drizzit was the exception that was supposed to prove the rule rather than shatter it.<br/><br/>I disagree with the Drow being an example of racism.  Now, there is a _ton_ of blatant racism all over the place.  The dark-skinned LOTR humans supporting Sauron?  Racist.  The lack of inclusive imagery in most of the RPG art and covers?  Racism.  The exception based nature of characters of colour in imagery?  Tokenism at best in most circumstances.  I personally failed on requesting a sufficiently inclusive cover on my own project so I will be the first to shoulder the blame.  <br/><br/>I would like to give a positive shout-out to White Wolf for having one of the 5 key, iconic character classes of Exalted (Dawn Caste) represented by a person of colour.  That was a positive step in a mainstream game which I think is a positive precedent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330605/#Comment_330605" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-18T12:09:22+00:00" title="June 18, 2011 12:09PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 18, 2011 12:22PM by Andy.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: migo</cite>I'll try to be charitable here, and just ask.

Please elaborate.<br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: D-503</cite>I agree with the premise, not sure about the examples though. In particular the reason people don't want good drow in their games is because it usually indicates a Drizz't fanboy (not sure about the number of Zs). It's an objection to an extremely specific character type more than anything else. The OP does hint at that, but I think that is actually pretty much the entire reason for that one. Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. I'm not commenting there on images of drow more widely.</blockquote>\nYou also have to factor in perceptions, that might be the intention of a DM banning good Drow, or players complaining about it, but a black person who was already a bit annoyed by Drow to begin with might see it a bit differently. Rather hard to find out for sure, because any such person probably wouldn't be playing D&amp;D anymore and likely stopped playing decades ago.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: D-503</cite>JD has a point that much of gaming is derived from the pulps, and the pulps were hands down straightforwardly racist. Like he says, we can still love them but that doesn't mean we accept them uncritically.</blockquote>\nYeah, I remember reading Oroonoko (a book from the 1600s), and finding that even when the author was trying to praise black people (which I assume back then was probably a big step), it came across as really derogatory.<br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: D-503</cite>I'd suggest that invisibility is a greater issue than evil elves having black skin. If the iconic character illustrations in a game included a black PC (which in D&amp;D they might for all I know) that would I think be more important than allowing the odd good drow</blockquote>\nI can't think of any off hand, even Dark Sun didn't have any that I can think of, and logically it should - the planet's a barren desert, you'd expect darker skin than was seen in the art. I can't think of 3e or 3.5 iconic characters that are black either, Mialee, Lidda and Tordek spring to mind immediately. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: D-503</cite>But then of course there's the risk of tokenism and condescension. Tricky stuff. That said, I do think there's a real danger in saying things like " I imagine if I were black, I wouldn't like hearing that" which is ultimately a form of appropriating someone else's experience, however well meaning.</blockquote>\nThis claim is a bit ridiculous, as it suggests we're never supposed to put ourselves in someone else's shoes. That's one of the basic tests to see if something you're about to say might be offensive - imagine you're someone else, see how they might react. You might have some examples of where it goes really bad, but that doesn't mean the core idea isn't sound.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: D-503</cite>Put another way, you could imagine (if you're not Scottish) how someone Scottish would feel about a particular image or representation (say Fat Bastard in the Myers' films). In doing that though you're assuming my experience for me. You could instead ask me how I, as a Scottish person, feel about it. That's better I guess, but the trouble is all that gets you is what I think. I can't speak for any other Scottish people.</blockquote>\nSure, if I knew you were Scottish. But there's a problem, there are hardly any black gamers, I've never met a single one at a convention even. So, how exactly am I supposed to ask someone black how they feel? I'd have to do it randomly and present the situation, which would end up being something of a leading question. That's not ideal either.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Pitre</cite>I would like to give a positive shout-out to White Wolf for having one of the 5 key, iconic character classes of Exalted (Dawn Caste) represented by a person of colour.  That was a positive step in a mainstream game which I think is a positive precedent.</blockquote>\nSomething worth looking at is how much of an effort is taken and what the reaction is. The exalted example strikes me as token, which hey, is better than nothing, but why not 3 of the 5? I've got a hunch at the answer. Greg Stolze played with inverting expectations both for race and gender in Reign, and got a lot of criticism for it. Now maybe he tried dropping too much in at once, the point I stalled on was having a really difficult time imagining someone who couldn't read silently and had to vocalise everything. If you see a negative reaction from a fan base when you do try to be more inclusive, that's not a particularly good sign for the hobby.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330610/#Comment_330610" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-18T12:56:51+00:00" title="June 18, 2011 12:56PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite><cite>Posted By: migo</cite>I'll try to be charitable here, and just ask.

Awesome.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: D-503</cite>To be honest I suspect the issue is more one of invisibility than these particular games. How much gaming art includes characters who are black where their being black is not somehow part of that character's concept? How often if a scenario needs a guy the PCs contact for info is he a Rajinder Patel rather than a John Harris? Unless, of course, his ethnicity is again integral to his concept? How often does Astroman take off his crime fighting mask to reveal his secret identity as Jim Woo? Unless, of course, Astroman's powers are somehow related to something Chinese.</blockquote>\nTRUTH.<br/><br/>Over the Edge is one classic game that deliberately named everyone in the setting from as broad and varied an ethnic palette as possible. It did make GMing a challenge though, because NPCs names didn't just roll off my tongue. I was constantly going "Ok, her name's, uh...Farad--er, 'Farah-da All-em-i', and she..." and the players would of course have a terrible time remembering the funky names, so I'd have to repeat them all the time, occasionally spelling them out, and immersion* would go right out the window. And of course OtE includes plain nonsense names too, so I was always going "yes, his first name is 'rigor.' Like the English word."<br/><br/>The whole effect seemed cool on paper, but White, Baptist me with my white college buddies just couldn't pull it off without awkwardness. I expect Jonathan Tweet handled it far more grace at his table.<br/><br/>All that is just to say, I suppose, that portrayal of Cultures of Color in RPG play or RPG writing will necessarily be limited by the cultural savvy of the persons doing it. My sister-in-law has a deep love of middle eastern culture, especially Iran, so when she introduces those cultural elements into real-world settings, or fantasied up in other settings, she does it with a deft touch that I would lack. I love Irish Celtic culture, and fancy i can do a decent job of portraying it. But do I know shit about, say, Kenya? No. Peru? Not a chance. Iceland? Nope. So if you called on me to play a Kenyan or Icelander, I'd be at a loss. and most likely play Ororo or Bjork. If you asked me to Gm (or write a module about) those cultures, I'd be up shit creek. And honestly, as a native Oregonian who's never set foot in the British Isles, I wouldn't be TERRIBLY qualified to write game material about my beloved Ireland, either.<br/><br/>Perhaps the takeaway is, it's great, truly, to be as culturally inclusive in your game writing and gameplay as possible. But we're each of us limited by our own cultural background and perspective. The TRULY best way for gaming to become more color-friendly (or female-friendly, queer-friendly, etc), is for more people of color to write game material.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel<br/><br/>*Not, you know, <i>Immersion </i>immersion...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330627/#Comment_330627" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-18T13:58:28+00:00" title="June 18, 2011  1:58PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: migo</cite>I can't think of 3e or 3.5 iconic characters that are black either</blockquote>\nWell, there is at least <a href="http://is2.okcupid.com/users/152/386/15238646033989136694/mt1128069140.jpg" rel="nofollow">Ember, the Iconic Monk</a>.

People coming from a place of privilege (most notably white men) won't see the delicacies in dealing with people of different races or genders. Personally, I was in my early 20s when feminism finally clicked for me and I wanted to help the movement out, but as well-intentioned as I was I couldn't see that the way I behaved instinctually was still sexist. I wanted to help, but I had a lifetime of living in our society to unlearn first. It didn't take a lifetime to undo the majority of what I'd internalized, but it took time and it took a lot of listening--listening to all of my female friends and their experiences and points of view. I'm not a paragon now, but I'm much better than I was and besides, it's not like I stopped striving.

Power is privilege. <br/>Skin color is not much of a privilege unto itself. And a lot of racism is partially "classism" (I hate this term, but it encapsulates what I mean), in that a black gangbanger is seen as scary, all gangbangers (oooh dangerous poor people!) are scary, and black people, wracked by centuries of systemic poverty, are assumed to be poor (and therefore dangerous.

That being said...</blockquote>\nDitto. \n<blockquote><br/>Class.<br/>A blue-collar white guy who lives in an all-white town in Mississippi is not "privileged" because he always deals with people like himself. That is beyond his control.<br/>Bill Gates, however, has all kinds of privilege. But it's not white privilege per se; it's mostly rich privilege with some whiteness augmenting it.<br/>In my experience, white people get off a little easier than folks of color, as systemic racism (perpetuated by a  highly white-dominated State) targets folks of color<i>towards the end of keeping white and non-white folks from trusting each other</i>.<br/><br/>Wealth is privilege. Power is privilege.<br/>Skin color is not much of a privilege unto itself. And a lot of racism is partially "classism" (I hate this term, but it encapsulates what I mean), in that a black gangbanger is seen as scary, all gangbangers (oooh dangerous poor people!) are scary, and black people, wracked by centuries of systemic poverty, are assumed to be poor (and therefore dangerous. Yay capitalism!).</blockquote>\nWhite male privilege isn't about people opening doors for you because you're Bill Fucking Gates, or about getting a free ride to college because your parents can afford to pay for it.  It's about American culture and society being set up to benefit white males.  It's about a white male being able to do a lot of things that others aren't able to do without being questioned as to their motives or qualifications.  In the United States, white male privilege means the deck is stacked against people who aren't white males, in ways that white males don't grok because we don't experience it.  (For instance: I could walk alone, from, let's say, Powell's Books to a bar that's located four blocks away, without worrying that I'm going to be robbed or raped by someone bigger than me.  I could walk in a group with four other people who look just like me and dress the same without people wondering whether we're a gang.  I could drive a BMW past a cop without him wondering whether I stole it.  I could walk into a meeting at work just before it starts and not feel like everyone in the room is staring at my tits.  I could run for President and no one would ever, even in the most passive aggressive and subtle ways, bring up my race, sex, or sexual preference, related to anything.)  One of the reasons these discussions go south is that there are people who will claim that because they haven't experienced any of those "for instance" situations, that no one has, and that people who aren't white males who claim they experienced them are lying.  <br/><br/>That's not to say that I haven't faced challenges in my life.  But not a one of them was related to my being a white male. \n<blockquote>Class is the big goddamned elephant in the room; thankfully it's becoming something more acceptable to talk about, but as long as white Appalachian welfare recipients are assumed to "benefit"* from racism in the same way that my rich, white parents do, something HUGE is missing from the discussion.<br/></blockquote>\nBullshit.  I don't care to what extent you cherry pick the circumstances: CEO of a billion dollar corporation or welfare recipient in an Appalachian village.  The one who is a black woman has had to wade through ten times as much shit as the one who is a white male.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330677/#Comment_330677" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-18T21:05:20+00:00" title="June 18, 2011  9:05PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Zac, <br/><br/>I think you are confusing the fictional Aryan "race" with the Aryan language. The idea of an Aryan race was created by Europeans to justify European racial and cultural superiority, and were automatically assumed to be light skinned without any justification or evidence (other than "The white race is clearly superior"). The actual speakers of the language roots dubbed Aryan, given the modern and historical peoples in those areas, were almost certainly not a light skinned race. Until the rise of European powers in the Renaissance, there's very little evidence that there were any white races running around dominating and influencing brown cultures, and much more that it was the other way around in a majority of cases. Our euro-centric history classes only makes it seem like Classical and Medieval Europe were major influences. (Although British Imperial rule in India, and American cultural domination over the whole world certainly ARE major influencers).<br/><br/>Most of this is based on little bits I've picked up from anthropology, linguistics, and historical studies, but I'm by no means an ethnographer. However, I think the more likely reason we find lighter skin looked upon favorably by a wide range of cultures in Europe, Africa, and Asia is not because of the genetics of an ancient dominating culture, but because of the basics of melanin in human skin. People in higher social strata are not the ones spending most of their time working outside, having their skin darken in the sun. These differences get woven into the cultural narrative.<br/><br/>(The "yous" here are no longer directed at Zac) <br/>I feel like this tangent is in danger of getting off topic, however. I was mainly using that as an example that I know how black and white as good and evil are not universal concepts (and I believe someone else mentioned that white is death in Japan, and black is life). I think this tangent does illustrate how difficult it is to find inclusive stories. So much of American and European understanding of history and mythology is seen through an extremely limited lens.  Most RPGs have been written and created from that perspective. Whether or not you want to get into blaming them, the best course of action is to try and find where your own lens is limited and broaden it as much as possible, regardless of the game you are playing or even whether you are playing any game at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330678">\n<div

traits in many non-western cultures"  Really?  Nothing to do with this thread, but can you elaborate?</blockquote>\nSorry, I may have conflated your two quotes, but you said:\n<blockquote>day = light = good night = dark = scary and evil Thats all that comes down to, and its universal.</blockquote>\nMaybe you just meant day and night are universal.  But in many cultures night is not evil, nor is day good, they just are part of the cycle. And even then you can't claim this duality is universal. Some culturals divide the day up into more categories. The Navajo said there were four times of day, dawn, midday, evening, and night. None of them were evil, but all of them were important. If you said "night and day" to the ancient Navajo, they would have probably asked what time of day you were talking about (and thought you were ignorant).<br/><br/>This dualism is not a universal concept. There are bad things and there are good things. Ghosts, demons and monsters in non-western cultures are almost never inherently that way. They've been wronged or they are wrong. Sometimes they must be defeated, but other times they must be appeased, befriended, reasoned with.<br/><br/>Nor are the colors from them universal. As I mentioned above, white is death and considered scary in Japan. I black is a force of creation in Navajo, and the first man is said to have been black, and white is the color of thought and destruction (it is not evil though, just something to treat with care).<br/><br/>In Hinduism, there are demons, certainly, but they are not evil as such, they are human emotions gone out of control. In fact they only get labeled demons by westerners trying to understand the role the Asuras have. They are really no different than the gods, except that they are in pursuit of selfish ends instead of selfless ends. <br/><br/>One such story is Kali's battled against Rakta-bija, the demon seed. Rakta-bija is one of a few demons who ousted the gods for a time. Every drop of his blood created another. In order to defeat him, Kali had to drink all his blood at once before it hit the ground. He was an extremely potent demon, and this sent her into a rage where she was going to destroy the world, and she would have if Shiva did not intervene. The main difference between Kali and Rakta-bija in this story is that she controlled her destructive urges. And this isn't a story about the triumph of good over evil. This story's meaning is about the triumph of your own divine nature over the urges to be destructive and selfish. On the flip side, many of the gods do things that don't seem good. In another story, Shiva almost destroys the world as a joke. <br/><br/>In western stories, good and evil are forces external to everyone. Good is the absence of sin and the pursuit of virtue, usually as dictated by one or more gods. Good is an end goal that is clearly defined. The heroes are the ones who either begin untainted by evil, or (mostly in Christian mythology) they gain the blessing of the being or beings that enforce the order.<br/><br/>Non-western stories are filled with capricious beings who lie and cheat and steal and fornicate and kill, sometimes with very little justification. But they are the heroes. They become heroes because they master themselves. And most often these beings are the highest most figures of the mythology. If there is someone trying to get them in line, it's because these figures are being assholes, not because there is an immutable code (if anything they show the code is mutable and serve as an example of the consequences for not trying your best). When they finally attain victory, it's because they've mastered their own selfish impulses and have seen the benefits of acting for the greater good. \n<blockquote>Also nothing to do with the thread, but possibly interesting.  The caste skin colour thing I heard was about peasants working in the sun getting darker and nobles staying indoors being lighter.</blockquote>\nYeah, that's my guess too (I elaborated on that with Zack). I don't see many stories of skin tone being reinforced because of historic events. Most often it's reinforced because of the realities of the present time. Division of labor readily explains constant reinforcement. It also explains why, despite heroes or gods of dark skin not resulting in a civil rights revolution (it's possible those revolutions happened, but then within a generation new tans come and old tans go).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330685/#Comment_330685" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-18T22:38:14+00:00" title="June 18, 2011 10:38PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 18, 2011 10:42PM by Beth_in_Virginia.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Chris Goodwin</cite>One of the reasons these discussions go south is that there are people who will claim that because they haven't experienced any of those "for instance" situations, that no one has, and that people who aren't white males who claim they experienced them are lying.</blockquote>\nHey now, this isn't an attempt on my part to claim that those things don't happen. I'm well aware that they do! <br/>The distinction I'm drawing revolves around the use of the word "privilege". I would consider the role that sexism plays, or that racism plays (for both, to maintain a hold over the working class), and then decide that white people suffer from institutionalized <i>anti-black</i> racism to a portion of the extent that black folks suffer it. <br/><br/>My point is: we need to see how racism against people of color hurts all of us, sometimes in very concrete ways, and work to end it. It's not that some of us are privileged; it's that we get off lighter from the ruling class and still get caught in the crossfire. A blow to black working class people is still going to be a blow to all working class people, for example. <br/><br/>Again, I'm not trying to claim that there is systemic anti-white racism at work under capitalism. I am saying that white working class people are not specially elevated above working class people of color - - to claim that such a thing is true is to declare that white workers have more to gain <i>than to lose</i> from systemic racism, which is not true. <br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Alvin">@Alvin</a>: thanks for the tip about the myth of an Aryan race.

I'm in a state where even slightly brown people can be asked to produce their immigration papers more or less at any time, even if they don't have any.  I could go on and on. Surely getting cops to treat racial minorities fairly does not (really) diminish whites (though many will insist otherwise), but it would be hopeless not to say that they aren't "elevated".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330691/#Comment_330691" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-18T23:28:14+00:00" title="June 18, 2011 11:28PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Louis CK breaks down the problems in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TG4f9zR5yzY" rel="nofollow">being white.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330701/#Comment_330701" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-19T02:50:30+00:00" title="June 19, 2011  2:50AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 19, 2011 2:51AM by stefoid.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alvin Frewer</cite><cite>Posted By: stefoid</cite>Associated with does not = universal.<br/><br/>"good and evil" are not treated as wholly distinct or inherent traits in many non-western cultures"  Really?

I'm saying it isn't enough to acknowledge the advantages white people have; if you want to convince white folks to help stop racism, it's important that they see how it hurts them too. That can be a personal realization, or it can be abstract/big picture stuff, or both. <br/>Doing LGBT activism showed me that people can't be counted on to care about an issue because It's the Right Thing; abstract-moralistic strategies just don't work, long term. On the other hand, if coming out to your friends and coworkers means they have one more LGBT person in their lives, that actually can change the terms of the debate. <br/><br/>Also - you want to talk about silencing behavior? How about being told (in not so many words) that you don't have the right to talk about people who aren't like you. I'm not speaking FOR anybody - I am talkin' about what white folks should be up to if they want to be a part of the solution.<br/>Putting lots of caution tape around an issue does not elevate the level of discussion about that issue. Avoiding discussion of race (and silencing others who want to talk about it) is a problem. <br/><br/>It kind of runs with the territory, though - American and British gamers in particular come from some fairly apolitical cultures (the former more so than the latter, admittedly), and they drag it into everything they do. Yeah, yeah, this isn't a political forum, or even a political gaming forum, but still. Guh.<br/><br/>This thread is probably past its expiration date, and if anybody wants to talk more about this with the likes of me, I'd happily do so in another format if you want.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/framweard" title="framweard"><img alt="framweard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/framweard">framweard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330777/#Comment_330777" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-19T21:41:28+00:00" title="June 19, 2011  9:41PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can we never say "people of color" again?

Yes. <br/><br/>The "proceed with caution" comments always irk me. I'm still not entirely sure why. <br/><br/>I'm guessing there's probably a single-digit percentile of forum-goers here whose family trees became family shrubs in the holocaust, or who grew up occasionally being told "Yer not going to synagogue after school today; people tried to burn it down last night" (Brooklyn in the 90s, BTW, not some place south of the Mason-Dixon), or being the only -berg in jr. high and being candidly told that it was my people that killed Jesus (Staten Island in the late 90s) and oughtn't I be ashamed of it *by a teacher*. And while I don't remember any splatbooks being devoted to American Slavery, don't worry - White Wolf went ahead and created a Wraith book just to cover the holocaust, because no game would be complete without 15 year old Christians getting hard-ons about how awesome it would be if *their* toon died bleeding at the bottom of a lime pit, their last breath being the stale sweat and blood and lime smell of the dozens of bodies atop them -- just like my great-grandmother's sister did! I sure hope my wraith gets an extra Fetter for being so awesomely dead. <br/><br/>And yet, however retarded your Jew lore might be, I never have that feeling of "Don't talk about my Jewness, you are not learned enough to be satisfyingly sensitive." I completely fail to understand it, and I'm not sure if anyone who actually throws it out there is one of the offended minorities in question, or just the racial equivalent of concern trolls.<br/><br/>And I'll go ahead and stipulate it, cause someone else will inevitably mention it: Yes, I know being a Jew doesn't suck as bad as being whatever else, because you can always choose to remove the identifiers that let people know you're a jew and just pass. None of that invalidates my actual point, if I have one, which I might not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330780/#Comment_330780" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-19T21:56:34+00:00" title="June 19, 2011  9:56PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: framweard</cite>Can we never say "people of color" again?

Traditional western fantasy is already white centric, it's got such language as white knights and black hearted - an idea that the lighter your skin, the more pure you are, and the darker the more corrupt you are.<br/></blockquote>\nIf you're talking of that fantasy that mimic medieval times, well... this is part of the setting, to my eyes.<br/>The idea of the lighter skin, the more pure you are is something specifically reserved to females, actually, and it's pretty cultural: only workers got tan, because they spent the whole day in the fields, under the sun. While a pure, and caste, and rich and noble girl, spending the whole day in the castles, possibly in a library, studying girly stuff, would never ever got tanned.<br/>Then there was all the turkish/muslim affair that afflicted the medieval times for almost half a millennia. -IF- you want to rebuild a setting that is a clear simulation of those days, they had those "values" and thus the cultural background of your game should be centered on that.<br/>-BUT-... no one forbids you to have your playing characters be those who <i>fight against</i> these values and play the non-white, non-christian guys who revolt, or also the white and christian guys who fight for the "minorities" rights, changing a (supposed) racist instance into something modern and ethical.<br/><br/>Going even deeper, racism is in every human. It's a heritage of the days we were living in packs. If someone is from out the pack, it is a potential danger (maybe it's a cannibal, or maybe he wants to steal our females! or maybe she is a female who wants to steal our men! gosh! Kill him/her!). Emargination and untrust were a social shields against that danger.<br/>I think this can be taken into games with a positive effect, aimed to explore this aspect of our life and our sociality.<br/>The opposite side of this coin is the effect of the "beautiful stranger". What about a game that goes around this: "a Stranger come to city, is it a good omen or bad?"<br/><br/>The Drow affair:\n<blockquote><br/> Drow take it to another level. Here you've got a race of people who are immediately identifiable as evil based purely on their skin colour<br/></blockquote>\nBreak.<br/>In the way you describe Drow, I assume you're referring to the myth that R. A. Salvatore invented in his novels about Drizzt, in which he actually explores the question "are really Drow innately evil?". And I assure you the answer is "no, it's the Lloth church that make them such".<br/>But the funnier thing is that according to the myth beneath the elves in the Forgotten Realm setting, they <i>were made dark</i> by Corellon after they lost the elven wars and decided to turn to evil. So they become dark because they were evil, and not the other way around.<br/>"Dark" is also not a proper term, cosmetically speaking, a Drow is a "negative" of a High Elf. Negative both in the etichal sense and in the color scheme, which is "inverted", like a film negative. Because you represent all the "negative" of the elven culture, you are made "negative" in the aspect as well.\n<blockquote><br/>Take it a step further, the general consensus is that good Drow PCs are unwelcome in games - maybe it's because people don't like good Drow Rangers who specialise in scimitars,<br/></blockquote>\nI think it's mainly because the players of such Drizzt-clones start then nerdly demanding "victory" just based on the idea they ARE Drizzt Do'Urden, and they are genetically immune to mistake.<br/>I had so much fun playing a Chaotic Neutral Drow in the Undermountain adventure setting, using my magical and poison resistance as a trap-finder tool ^^ I were a thief and usinf "find trap" ability always was followed by the drow in question trying to make the trap trigger and soak the effect willingly, cheast beating "come, fireball, come to me! I can stop ye!"<br/><br/>But... are you talking of real ethical/racial issues, or just criticizing the Moral Alignment subsystem of AD&amp;D and D&amp;D?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14511/some-rpgs-are-not-terribly-non-white-friendly" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14511/some-rpgs-are-not-terribly-non-white-friendly" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14511/some-rpgs-are-not-terribly-non-white-friendly/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F14511%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F14511%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
