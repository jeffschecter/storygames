It went so awesomely that we hope to be able to have some foreign author guest next year. This is why I introduce you to:<br/><br/><b>InterNosCon 2009</b><br/>\u201cInter Nos\u201d is latin and means \u201cjust between us\u201d. In fact this Con is not meant to introduce new people to games (there are already many Cons for this!). INC was born to let story/indie/whatchamacallit-games fan meet, play together and get to know each other. It was held for the first time in 2008 for 15 people and again this year for 71 people (:O).<br/><br/>A few numbers to get the idea about this year:<br/>- 2 days in a hotel in front of the sea<br/>- 44 tabletop and live events from USA and Europe were proposed. Among them:<br/>Agon, Annalise, Anima Prime, Covenant, Cuore Mediterraneo (Mediterranean Heart), Doubt, Esoterrorist, In A Wicked Age, Memories of War, My Life with Master, Misspent Youth, Capes, Century Club: Italian Chapter, Dirty Secrets,<br/>Dreamwake v. 3, Grey Ranks, In an Epic Age, Don\u2019t Rest Your Head, Polaris,<br/>Ravendeath, Shock: Social Science Fiction, Storming the Wizard's Tower,<br/>Trame (Storylines), Primetime Adventures, Dogs in the Vineyard, Contenders, Fiasco,<br/>Houses of the Blooded, No Money Only Glory, Escape or Die!, Soma: the<br/>Bizzarre Adventures!, The Upgrade!, Viandanti sul Mare di Nebbia (Travellers on the Mist Sea), Beast Hunters, Cat, Elar, Long Live the King!, Spione, Sturm und Drang, Trollbabe<br/>- furthermore: Free Bar and Costume Party on Saturday evening (this year theme: Far West - Pioneers of Play)<br/><br/>An important thing to know is that this is not fair, nobody has a booth for sales, we just put people together, help them organize an event calendar and find people to play with. All the events are held by fans of the games.<br/><br/>It seems this year everybody had a lot of fun as you can see in the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWDuZmJrBJk" rel="nofollow">clips</a>, <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/narrattiva/InterNosCon09#" rel="nofollow">photos</a> and <a href="http://picasaweb.google.it/SolarExalted/InterNosCon200902#" rel="nofollow">further photos</a> and <a href="http://picasaweb.google.it/SolarExalted/InterNosCon200902#http://www.gentechegioca.it/vanilla/comments.php?DiscussionID=766" rel="nofollow">comments</a>:<br/><br/>We plan on doing something better next year, so, if we manage to invite some author reading this forum, please remember it was a really cool event and don\u2019t you even roll the dice, just say \u201cyes\u201d <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Useful links:<br/><br/><a href="www.internoscon.it" rel="nofollow">Event site</a> <br/><br/><a href="http://www.gentechegioca.it/vanilla/?CategoryID=8" rel="nofollow">Event Forum</a><br/><br/>--<br/>Claudia Cangini                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_203854">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203854/#Comment_203854" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-28T12:09:06+00:00" title="April 28, 2009 12:09PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool!

In the end I settled on Viandanti sul Mare di Nebbia (Travellers on the Mist Sea) which I wrongly named as Viandanti nella Nebbia (Travellers in the Mist), because that's how tired I was. It's an intriguing and beautifully simple freeform LARP scenario which I'm playing in <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://picasaweb.google.com/narrattiva/InterNosCon09#5330571684845740546" rel="nofollow">this picture</a> with Rafu (I'm the one with the top-hat, Rafu is the man in the brown jacket sitting right behind me). Right after it I've played Trame with Rafu which was enormous fun, and as we had at least a dozen onlookers hooked by the absurdity of our characters, I would say it was a huge success overall. On saturday I played Doubt and Spirit of the Century, which were amazing in truly different ways. Doubt was a really deep emotional experience, while for SotC I prepared a pulp cover for my character as soon as I got home because it's SO FUN!<br/>\nIn the end, I still have a hard time now deciding what was the best thing from the Con, which really gives you measure of how wonderful it was.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204993">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204993/#Comment_204993" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-03T06:23:01+00:00" title="May  3, 2009  6:23AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To clarify, Trame is a game in-development from Carlo Rebagliati and Rafu: at the con they played a very funny and loud "you all meet in a tavern" scenario... kinda like the comic prequel to a classic dungeon delve.

And yes, the video is exactly \u201cThe coolest thing\u201d (we loved this meme and copied it!)<br><br>Actually we\u2019re so happy with this event cause afterward people seemed really enthusiastic about it. I think this is because it\u2019s a completely new format for Italy (albeit maybe in USA they have something similar in the Go Play and Nerdly events?). Up to now you could attend many Conventions with selling booths and demos but those where quite chaotic and uncomfortable as places to play in. In some Cons you\u2019d find the awesome people of <a href="http://www.flyingcircus.it/" rel="nofollow">Flying Circus</a> who organized a calendar of events but you had to worry for yourself about food and a place to sleep.<br/>In practice we mixed the experience of Flying Circus (events program with on line reservation and help desk on site) and Solmukohta/Knudepunkt/etc. (fully organized event comprising of food/sleep accomodations) but with play instead of panels (I think some panels will appear in future editions).<br/><br/>At first we had to literally pester people to have them propose a game, giving interested attendees a program to sign for, but I think in the end everybody understood this is the only way to get the most from your time at the Con: arriving with a full schedule of pre-reserved events is your best chance of maximum fun <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Also, since this Con started with word of mouth between us and our friends and the forum "Gentechegioca"* (previously "Narraforum") the game presented were mainly story/indie/whatsisname-games (you get the idea).<br/>This games started to get known in Italy just recently and are also meeting some negative prejudices from fan of other games so it\u2019s not always easy to find a serene environment in which to discuss about those. <br/>At INC, fans of whatchamacallit games met, played, tried new things, discussed and saw they weren't so few, after all. This is inspiring some sense of a community and a sharing of different experiences.<br/>Also the huge quantities of food and alcohol made sure the environment where EXTREMELY serene XD.<br/><br/>Michele and myself are really happy and have great plans for next year &gt;:]<br/><br/>* \u201cGentechegioca\u201d means \u201cPeoplewhoplay\u201d                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_205064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205064/#Comment_205064" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-03T16:08:04+00:00" title="May  3, 2009  4:08PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Any cons going on this summer?
