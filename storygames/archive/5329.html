Laws has really got me thinking with a recent LJ post <a href="http://robin-d-laws.livejournal.com/256248.html" rel="nofollow">here.</a> The discussion about earned victory and the cop-out of the Deus Ex Machina. So what I want to discuss is: When is a Deus Ex Machina not a Deus Ex etc.?<br/><br/>Our beloved heroes are getting the sh*t kicked out of them by baddies. A <i>player</i> calls for assistance through some sort of summoning (magic, BW relationships, Allies merit) and the new arrival thrashes the baddies. Now, is the situation free of Deus Ex Stigma just because the player initiated it? Or is the way the scene plays out that retroactively decides if the assist was removing the players from their achievement? If the player controls the NPC friendly intelligently and effectively, it's easy to say that the scene is free of "tampering." If the player turns the NPC into a kamikaze moron, does that mean he is abusing his privilege to deny the player's control of the scene as PC entities? If the GM is the controller of the NPC how does that affect the scenario?<br/><br/>What interests me is the question of ownership in the scene and achievement. Is the player spoiling the other players' involvement in the scene, like a GM would if he suddenly had James Bond appear on the scene and save the world when the players screw up? (That scenario is actually recommended in the the edition of the James Bond RPG that I own.) I don't have any answers. Just interested in opinions.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119836/#Comment_119836" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-16T07:11:08+00:00" title="January 16, 2008  7:11AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems to me it's partly a question of whether or not the deus ex is wielded as a tool by the players (we'll use this as a lever to make our victory more successful/assured), or as a crutch (we got our asses pulled out of the fire by someone who wasn't us), and in either case how much effort was expended to make that possible.  <br/><br/>I also think there's something to be said for reserving the coup de grace for the players themselves.  <br/><br/>Say you're fighting Satan Himself and you've gone through a lot of effort to make sure that the Archangel Michael shows up on the battlefield and gives Old Scratch a sound thrashing.
