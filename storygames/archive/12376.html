I reworked the text several times over before its publication. In total: 8-10 hours of writing &amp; design time</li><li>I playtested the game several times, and quickly realized that the Jagged Women needed more concrete moves. So I added them. </li><li>I spent 15-20 hours laying the book &amp; pdf out. This was my first real project that I used inDesign for, after numerous not-serious experiments with it</li><li>I released the pdf, and then the print, and I first sold it in person at Go Play this weekend.</li></ul>\nSo, the decision to publish for money!<br/><br/>Well, my playtesting and editing, all of that detail oriented stuff, that was motivated by the notion that I might sell it.<br/>If it'd just been a thing, that I was making for me and my friends, I'd not have tightened the rules, or the text (as much as I did), and I would have given up on the inDesign portion after 7 hours, declaring it "good enough."<br/><br/>Now, John Harper was a ghost that haunted this whole process. He designs beautiful, tight stuff and releases it for free. Ghost/Echo, Lady Blackbird, The Mustang... I'm looking at all of you, here.<br/>The decision to charge dollars for Gun Thief was definitely made while acknowledging the existence of his products.<br/>In the end, I came to a decision: earning money helps me feel proud of my work, helps my work gain attention, and <i>can</i> make people value my work more.<br/>It also allows me to create a physical product, and I like my rpgs as physical products.<br/><br/>The $3 price point was one that came about pretty naturally. At first I thought $2 was the sweet-spot, then I remembered that Paypal dings you and that I'd be making less than the cup of coffee each time I made a sale. And so I bumped it up to $3.<br/><br/>The $5 price point came about even more naturally. The physical books cost $2 each, for printing and shipping, when bought in a 50-unit order.<br/>So, I tacked my $3 of profit onto my $2 of costs.<br/><br/>So, let's look at how the project has faired:\n<ul><li>Over the internet, I've sold 17 pdfs.</li><li>Over the internet, I've sold 8 bundles.</li><li>At Go Play, I sold out of all the copies I brought by mid-day on Saturday. I don't remember exactly how many copies I brought, but it was around 15 for-sale copies.</li></ul>\n<b>People who've bought the game, weigh in!</b> How is the print quality? how tight is the design? what did you expect from a $3/$5 product, and did you get it? how does this micro-publishing thing settle with you?<br/><br/>Things I've noticed about the process:\n<ul><li>With a $3-5 price-point, tweeting and facebooking can generate immediate sales. On a social-media-network whim, people will buy your game.</li><li>With a $3-5 price point, you can make sales by just sharing a neat thing. Like that photo-op scene that me and my girlfriend shot for the print-sales thread. Like a single mechanic. Whatever.</li><li>People like buying stuff at conventions. Having products that cost less than lunch money means that people will buy it without reservation, on the spot. Both me and Joel Shempert sold out of all of our copies that we brought (of Gun Thief and the Dreaming Crucible, respectively. Both at $5.)</li></ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SquidLord" title="SquidLord"><img alt="SquidLord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/690/n6I44LRPBAB7W.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SquidLord">SquidLord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277713/#Comment_277713" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-24T13:35:17+00:00" title="June 24, 2010  1:35PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>As one of the people who bought The Gun Thief, and not only bought it but bought the bundle, I have to say that I have absolutely no objections to the product as delivered whether it be the PDF or the print version. For your first InDesign work it looks absolutely fantastic. Nice open layout, good structure, good sense of composition, and the choice to go with a comic book printer rather than a booklet or pamphlet printer was inspired. No, the comic book format will probably not last as long as a nice stapled pamphlet version on heavier paper -- but I don't really care, since I have the PDF and can print it on whatever I want whenever I want, so if I want to take it off to a high-wear convention, I just have a nice coil-bound copy printed for cheap and away I go.</p>\n<p>I'm actually rather surprised that you haven't seen more sales for the game than what you report here. Admittedly, it is a bit of a niche product but it's extremely well done and I think all you really need is to get it in front of more people to get more sales at this cost point. Anything that you can do to get it mentioned and especially put in front of people will sell it. That's really all you need to do.</p>\n<p>(I have to admit that I do take a certain pleasure in being responsible for at least two of your bundle sales, one to myself and one to my sidekick.

I'm in love with all twelve pages.<br/><br/>Having it printed like a comic book is a novel and fun format and I enjoy having a game product that's unique that way. The thin, delicate paper with fingerprint-magnet black does make me a little skittish about preserving the thing. I'll probably put it in a comic book sleeve to preserve it! (Which is kinda cool anyway.)<br/><br/>I now I mentioned this in person, but the ad for Ka-Blam Digital Printing inside the back cover is jarring and out of step with the whole aesthetic of the book. It was especially distracting to play with no character sheet and having the book open to that page the whole time for reference. In a game where women as a dangerous sexual force are so central to play, having the colorful and very non-Jagged Ka-Blam girl beaming her smile at me was a weird dissonance. Not sure if there's anything to be done, though. I'm sure running the ad is part of your financial model and they don't offer a variety of ad styles. I like the idea someone had (Ben or Jackson, I think) for convincing Ka-Blam to pay <i>you</i> for designing an edgier ad!<br/><br/>Your reasoning process on price points makes a lot of sense to me. I've sold a $2 PDF before and yeah, it just doesn't seem worth it. And for a printed product, one reason I like $5 is that it's a nice round sum that people will often have on them, with a minimum need for making change. It's actually <i>more convenient</i> for everyone involved than, say, $4. This is super-important for selling street-style, in person and out of your satchel without a storefront or cashbox. Though it was super-fun at Go Play to see two people <i>Paypal me from their phones</i> to buy copies on the spot!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mcdaldno</cite>People like buying stuff at conventions.

It helped that the merch table was just, like, our games and one other, I suppose, but then, that's a good contrast: Ben Lehman's excellent The Drifter's Escape sold a few copies at $13 (including to me!), but GT and TDC were a much easier purchase for more people to make.<br/><br/>In a busier con space with more works competing for attention, you might need to mark out these kinds of products somehow (i.e. not just shove them on a rack in the middle of a bunch of others), but that's just a secondary presentation issue.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277853/#Comment_277853" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-25T10:38:51+00:00" title="June 25, 2010 10:38AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: SquidLord</cite>I'm actually rather surprised that you haven't seen more sales for the game than what you report here.

Make a twitter account for the Gun Thief and post links to AP posts and to your photos and stuff.  Start a flickr pool, maybe - have people take or submit their own Gun Thief photos.  Borrow a video camera and make a quick teaser "trailer" for the Gun Thief.  Create some stuff that's easy for people who are excited to share the game to shop around.  <br/><br/>I've never made or sold a game, but I do work in marketing and I know that a good strategy, if you're a single-man operation, is to turn your fans into a big ol' hype machine.  Look at how Luke and Jared pushed Freemarket - hell, I'm a prime example of it.  I love the idea of the game enough that I'll retweet cool stuff they post, I'll talk to people and send links.  Create what Luke called "your fellow mystery cultists" and you're good to go.  As long as the PDF is easily accessible to buy, people will jump at it.  A product like yours is totally an impulse buy, too - people who see some neat photos or get a half-decent pitch (enough to generate curiousity) will throw a couple of bucks at you just to feel like they're "in" on the secret.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277866/#Comment_277866" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-25T11:31:32+00:00" title="June 25, 2010 11:31AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 25, 2010 11:33AM by Mcdaldno.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: skinnyghost</cite>Create what Luke called "your fellow mystery cultists" and you're good to go.</blockquote>\nThanks, Adam!<br/><br/>I've been scheming about ways to make this happen.<br/>I definitely have all of the buyers on an email list, that I am ready to pull out when the time is right.<br/><br/>One thing I've been toying with is the idea of a situation list, tentatively titled <i>42 Problems</i>.<br/>It would describe a bunch of half-baked situations (42, to be precise, or any other random number I established).<br/><br/>So, you could flip to Svanski's Lumber, and read all about Doukhobor kingpin Walter Svanski, and how he might show up in your apartment with some big demands, one day. The idea is that you'd be able to (as The Law or Jagged Women) grab one of these situations, breathe life into it, and roll it into play.<br/><br/>Anyways, I thought it'd be cool to solicit <i>Problems</i> from people who've bought the game, and collate them all into this little 8-page PDF, or whatever....<br/><br/>...and then give it out for free to anyone who posts AP somewhere on the internet and links me to it.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277868">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277868/#Comment_277868" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-25T11:45:09+00:00" title="June 25, 2010 11:45AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joel</cite>I now I mentioned this in person, but the ad for Ka-Blam Digital Printing inside the back cover is jarring and out of step with the whole aesthetic of the book.

Honestly, the way it works is: you save 25 cents per copy if you let them run their ad in your inside back cover. I really like Ka-Blam, and they were absolute dolls in working with me on publishing Gun Thief. Their openness to publishing non-comic stuff, their great customer service, and their willingness to accept a format other than their preferred when my shit kept fucking up... it made me a huge fan of theirs. The ad was both a way of saving money and of acknowledging how awesome they are.<br/><br/>That said, the ad TOTALLY clashes. It's bright and friendly, and Gun Thief is b&amp;w and grungy. Total clash. Totally bad.<br/><br/>Thanks for following through on that point.<br/>Going in its place is a list of names.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277869/#Comment_277869" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-25T11:45:13+00:00" title="June 25, 2010 11:45AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not your customer, but if you'll allow me to make a marketing suggestion: raise your prices.

I mean, if I'm selling the PDF for $10, I'm asking for a dollar per page. That's ludicrous.<br/><br/>Honestly, I've tried charging lots for a small game (see Ribbon Drive). It leaves a sour taste in some people's mouths, even if I make it beautiful and add some neat value to it (see cool CD, featuring cool bands). That avenue is one I'm not interested in exploring further.<br/><br/>And so, the current exploration is in tiny products. Honestly, I'm not interested in Gun Thief making it as a $10 or $15 item. I want to know if a tiny game can flourish, can be its own kind of market. So far, I'm hearing a moderate yes: I can sell out of the stock I bring to cons. I can sell PDFs and can chew through modest print runs pretty quickly. It's enough income to pay for some of my immense coffee budget, and that's a nice feeling. People like it.<br/><br/>If the price point prevents you from saying "this is worth my investment" because it is so little, I'd expect the same reaction to its form (a dozen pages, roughly) and its gameplay (an hour, roughly).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277873/#Comment_277873" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-25T11:56:07+00:00" title="June 25, 2010 11:56AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>I'm not your customer, but if you'll allow me to make a marketing suggestion: raise your prices.

Or rather through Nelson, since I used to date a girl who lived in Prince George. Nice area, but as you put it "geographically isolated."</p>\n<p>Still, for a product like Gun Thief, as far as I can tell it in relation to other online-centric distributed products, the key for continuing to sell is simply that: continuing to sell. You can create a Facebook page, you can post on RPGnet, and you can represent at cons but your big win is going to be in continuing to do all of that, as much as you can. Someone else suggested creating a Twitter account; that's absolutely a great idea if you don't already have one for yourself. If you do have one, make sure that it's linked to from any of the webpages that talk about your game and that you post game related content (links to actual play sessions, links to threads where you discuss the game, etc.) on a regular basis. Same thing with the Facebook page, and so on. It's going to be an ongoing process, as often and as consistently as you can manage to present content.</p>\n<p>It's not like the PDF is going to spoil in storage; a copy of Gun Thief bought next month will be just as good as one bought this month, and so will the one in the month after that. As long as you keep presenting it, as long as you keep putting it forward, as long as people keep seeing it you will have more people buying it and a $5 price point ensures that people can do so on a whim and/or instantaneously when the opportunity presents itself.</p>\n<p>Show up on every RPG-related web forum that you can find. Get people to talk about Gun Thief as much as you can. Show up at conventions and run it when you can afford to. Find somebody willing to run an online version, maybe using Skype or TalkShoe, and link favorably to the recording of the game. Nothing sells a game like people playing a game. (That's actually one of the interesting things about the photo shoot you did with your girlfriend, that it came across like game-content, like play. Aside from looking cool, it gave an idea of what the game experience was like. That's a good thing.)</p>\n<p>The more people that see your game, the more people will buy it. The more people that hear about your game, the more people will buy it. You want to find ways to have more people see your game and more people hear about your game. Podcasts are good, interviews are good, forums are good, videos are good (as long as the sound quality is reasonable, which is a real problem with a lot of the promotional videos I see these days). Anything that you create that makes people want to share that material with their friends, via liking or blogging or tagging or whatever, that is a sale waiting to happen.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277906/#Comment_277906" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-25T13:46:41+00:00" title="June 25, 2010  1:46PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, yeah, for sure - get it in a podcast.

It takes little effort to list your game and keep your RPGGeek entry alive. I'm no expert on this, but I have had some good luck with it. How to Host a Dungeon has won some good friends and fans through RPG Geek--definitely some people that never would have found the game otherwise. <br/><br/>RPG Geek is about finding that dedicated group of people who already grok what your game and your publishing ethos are already about. They exist, so go find them.<br/><br/>Here's how it works:<br/><br/>1. Create a page for your game (if one doesn't exist already). Don't be a shill, just use this as a place to present your game to the world.<br/>2. If you've got some pics, Web links, or other useful stuff, post it. Having a few things on the page shows that the game isn't just an orphaned entry.<br/>3. Find some geeklists that you think are groovy and in the same vein as Gun Thief. For example, if there isn't a geeklist for "cool print games $5 and under", you should create one. Likewise for games about loners with guns.

IIRC, the first year went ok, and then (between printer issues and real-life events) it went off the rails. (if anyone has more info, feel free to correct me).<br/><br/>Anyway, here's the lessons I drew from following his experiences: if you don't deliver on a subscription, you will feel terrible. Personally, I would make sure that any subscription-based model was as front-loaded as possible, up to and including having all of the material done and maybe even printed before offering subscriptions.

I'd happily share that information.<br/><br/><b>Finding a Printer</b> (30 minutes, plus a lifetime)<br/><br/>I spend a lot of time (an hour a week, averaged out?) researching "publishing stuff" like printers. It's more of a compulsion than anything. I'd already heard about Ka-Blam a few months earlier, after Johnstone mentioned them to me. Props to Johnstone.<br/><br/>So the time I spent scouting for a printer expressly for this project was about 30 minutes. I already knew Ka-Blam was the cheapest solution for this format, and I only sought out a cursory confirmation of that. Ka-Blam has an online price calculator, so I already knew roughly how much it would cost. (The total came to $90USD for 50 copies shipped to Canada.)<br/><br/><b>Formatting for Printer</b> (1 hour, plus previously mentioned time)<br/><br/>The time I spent re-working my files into the right format for the printer (Ka-Blam Comics) is already included in my 15-20 hours of layout &amp; design time.<br/><br/>Ka-Blam is designed for comics, and thus it wanted image files of all my individual pages. After struggling to try to make that happen, I sent a couple emails back and forth with them, and they offered to accept a PDF instead. So... 1 hour customer service time, spread across two days?<br/><br/><b>Proofs</b> (1 hour)<br/><br/>Living in Canada, shipping from Orlando is a bitch. They had the option to only accept a digital proof. I gambled, and didn't accept a physical proof. Thus, time spent checking a proof as such was very low. I mostly just scanned for typos. I didn't find any at the time. Since then, I've found an omitted word and one awkward line break.<br/><br/><b>Inspecting the Entire Run</b> (1 hour)<br/><br/>When they arrived, that package of 50, I checked them all out to ensure that none were unusable. The cover is a bit streaky (it's pure black on glossy paper, so this was kind of expected). I made sure none were really streaky. I made sure the staples were in the right spot. I flipped through each book quickly, to make sure all the pages looked right. I spent about a minute on each, plus some time just staring at the stack as a whole, for no apparent reason.<br/><br/><b>Marketing</b> (5 hours)<br/><br/>I've spent about 2-3 hours posting about Gun Thief here.<br/>I've talked about it on twitter several times.<br/>I spent about an hour making a Facebook page that I've updated occasionally.<br/>I've spent an hour or two fiddling with my website page for <a href="http://buriedwithoutceremony.com/gun-thief/" rel="nofollow">Gun Thief</a>, most of which was trying to get that image slider for the photo drama to display correctly.<br/><br/><b>The Photo Shoot</b> (2 hours)<br/><br/>One day, I decided I should dress up like a gun thief, Kaleigh should dress up like a jagged woman, and we should stage a little vignette story and share the photos online.<br/>If you know me and Kaleigh, you know that this is a pretty normal decision for us, as far as decisions go.<br/><br/>So, we spent fifteen minutes dressing up and looting my brother's room for weapons, and then thirty minutes shooting.<br/>I spent about an hour selecting and tweaking photos. And then I uploaded them to my fileave account.<br/><br/><b>Distribution</b> (4 hours)<br/><br/>I've emailed out a lot of PDFs, mailed a couple hard copies, and dealt with handling cash at GPNW.<br/>I'm not sure how to account for that time accurately, but let's say I've spent 4 hours doing that.<br/><br/><b>Mailing List</b> (4 hours)<br/><br/>I added a page of names to the PDF, and sent that updated PDF to everyone who's on the mailing list (hint: if I've sent you the pdf, I've included you on it). This list of names (grouped into genre appropriate categories, each category containing 5-20 handpicked names) took me like 3 hours.<br/><br/>I'm inviting those who've bought the game to join in on a super secret project (<i>42 Problems</i>). I spent an hour or two writing instructions and examples for that project. In the future, I'll spend 2-12 hours on this super secret project.<br/><br/><b>Summary</b><br/><br/>I'm probably nearing 50 hours of invested time. I've done better than breaking even.<br/>Much of the work has been a labour of love.<br/><br/>The most draining parts were the last 4 hours of layout, the distribution, and struggling to make the website image slider thing work properly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278157">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278157/#Comment_278157" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-27T12:30:31+00:00" title="June 27, 2010 12:30PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>P.S.

But this impression is heavily predicated on precedent: the only products you typically see at this price range are quick throw-away stuff that is not worthy of a more elaborate treatment. In my experience people are more likely to first publish and then play these small things.<br/><br/>I sure am digging a hole for myself and Solar System here. No idea why I would assume no playtesting from others when I certainly did it for my own cheapie. Perhaps it's because my playtesting routine mostly consisted of playing the game over a couple of years and then writing the text on that basis, thus sort of dodging post-writing playtesting for the most part.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278164/#Comment_278164" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-27T13:24:19+00:00" title="June 27, 2010  1:24PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 27, 2010 1:25PM by jenskot.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right now it looks like before taxes you are making around $2 for every hour you invested. If you sell...<br/><br/>2 times more... that's around $4/hr<br/>3 times more... that's around $6/hr<br/>10 times more... that's around $20/hr<br/><br/>These numbers are probably off but they give you an idea of what is involved. <br/><br/>I think the game is to make more of these, see which ones have traction, and then reinvest in them. The low investment ideally means you can create more.<br/><br/>I wonder at such a low price point how much you would benefit from advertising on sites like rpg.net in terms of exposure. At $25 for 25,000 impressions... you would need to sell 1 game every 2,500 times it is viewed to effectively break even (around 10 games). Advertising somewhere else may be better (depends on the game and the community) or even reinvesting the money into a video instructing people how to play that can be shared. <br/><br/>I don't think it is about the money for you (and even if it was)... so the real trick is how to turn those 10 new people exposed to your game into more than people who buy it... but people that actually play it and then talk about it. I think that is where the true value is in comparing micro publishing to free publishing. Can the little money you make be turned into an opportunity to get even more exposure compared to just having a free game? <br/><br/>A lot of marketing people try to sell silver bullet solutions but I don't think that works. You need to experiment. Put your game out in front of different people in different ways and mercilessly measure the results. Then try something new (or old) based on what you find and do it again and again till you have the right process for you. And even if you do find a successful process... doesn't mean it will be successful tomorrow. That's why experimenting all the time is so important! It's often not just finding the right people or the right game but the fight game for the right people in a way that is convenient for everyone involved.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278165">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278165/#Comment_278165" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-27T13:29:20+00:00" title="June 27, 2010  1:29PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you're selling a game for money, you better have played it (including playtesting) pretty thorough.

Could Gun Thief have received that treatment? Yeah, it could have.<br/><br/>But I looked at it, and I felt like it was pretty tight to begin with, and I decided that its place in the world was as this quick little project, born of love and released before it soured in my brain.

It just means that I'm gonna wait and see what the buzz is like for your game -- from other folks playing it -- before I fork over any money.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, as long as your game delivers what you promised.  Maybe it does.  Certainly, the people who've read it and the folks who played it at GPNW are super excited, so I'm optimistic.<br/><br/>Also, I think it's dangerous and somewhat poisonous to assume that other designers dislike or disapprove of you (as a designer), your games, or your publishing plans because you asked us what we thought and we told you.  I think what you're doing is great.  I think what all other designers are doing is great.  Just because it's not what I would do and not what I would suggest other people do... whatever.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mcdaldno</cite>As the game has no dice, numbers or mechanical tracks to balance...

That is a really nice overview.  Going through and thinking about which parts of those I'd find fun and which parts would cause me to question whether it was worth it, I think my keys would be layout and marketing.  I enjoy layout up to a point, and I like talking about stuff I've made; but if I can't make InDesign do what I want, or no one gives a shit about my game, the satisfaction quotient goes downhill real fast.  At least I am heartened to know that printing 50 comic-style books can be done easily and cheaply!<br/><br/><b>Assumptions re: playtesting:</b><br/>In RPG land I have <i>zero</i> assumptions, and my assumptions are not correlated <i>at all</i> with price.  If I see a free indie game, a $20 indie game, and a $40 white wolf game, and am told that one was never playtested, one was playtested 5 times, and one was playtested 300 times, I couldn't begin to guess which was which.  Maybe white wolf knows the book sells on art and fiction, and sweating playability is time wasted; maybe the obsessive indie stalwart thinks his masterwork ought to be free on some principle; maybe the new indie enthusiast figures that if it looks like his game probably works, he might as well charge "real game" money for it.<br/><br/><b>Investing in yourself</b><br/>Given the level of success you've had with Gun Thief, Joe, I wonder if any of Jenskot's ideas sound appealing to you.

There is, I think, a sense that while design can be fun and disposable, publishing -- especially commercial publishing, especially print (not PDF) publishing -- is SERIOUS BUSINESS and that folks who take to it lightly are somehow doomed, cheating their audiences, or cheapening the efforts of publishers who labor for untold hours on end to churn out a "worthy" print product.  That's not a burden I was really trying to lay on Joe here, but it's definitely an attitude that I was playing into a bit.  GB Steve's point about the "game as cappucino" model is a good one.  We pay money for relatively disposable things that provide us a moment of joy, well, all the time.  And while we might not like thinking about games as disposable... that certainly lowers the bar significantly for publication and sales.<br/><br/>So yeah, I in no way intended to intimidate people out of sharing their experiences with PLAYTEST SMACKDOWN and am pondering your point further, though I'm not sure I have anything more to say about it yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278320/#Comment_278320" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T11:47:57+00:00" title="June 28, 2010 11:47AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Jonathan. It's good and helpful to hear more of your thought process. Especially since I didn't think to ask. I need to learn to do that alongside of sharing my own "that makes me uncoooomfortablllle..." feelings.<br/><br/>I should stress that it's not just you or this discussion. There's an aggregate of evidence that suggests to me that if I say "I sold this game after playtesting it only a couple times" on Storygames I'll garner one or more responses along the lines of "You shouldn't do that," or worse. I can't think of a single case of "shouldn'tism" that couldn't be expressed equally well as "what I like is" or "when I pay money for a game I want it to be" or somesuch.<br/><br/>I don't know if I have anything more to say either, especially since I don't wanna harsh Joe's thread. Maybe I'll be brave and start my own soon.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278322/#Comment_278322" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T11:59:08+00:00" title="June 28, 2010 11:59AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joel</cite>I don't know if I have anything more to say either, especially since I don't wanna harsh Joe's thread.</blockquote>\nNo, this is lovely conversation.<br/><br/>I've done all of my intended sharing in this thread already, and discussions about finished/unfinished are totally fine in this thread, especially if there's a considered tone to it, especially if my game can serve as a focal point for differing opinions and perspectives.<br/><br/>So: carry on, if ya want!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278376/#Comment_278376" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T14:46:25+00:00" title="June 28, 2010  2:46PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess that's all predicated on me or Jonathan thinking of something new to say!<br/><br/>Thank you, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278378/#Comment_278378" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T15:04:19+00:00" title="June 28, 2010  3:04PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ccreitz</cite>Supposing one wanted to tweet about Gun Thief\u2026 one would want the username of the author and a web page to point at.
