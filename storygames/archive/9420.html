I'm considering ordering Burning Wheel, too but I'm not sure if it's the "right" game for me. I remember reading that it is too complicated.<br/>\nAccording to the author there are only superficial similarities between these games.<br/>\nIs there anyone willing to fill me in about similarities and differences between both systems? (A brief overview is enough.)<br/>\nWhich one do you consider being the better one?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208850">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RichD" title="RichD"><img alt="RichD" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RichD">RichD</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208850/#Comment_208850" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-24T05:06:32+00:00" title="May 24, 2009  5:06AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I consider it like comparing two Romance languages.  A lot of the words and syntax are the same and you can easily see its from the same source, but if you try to use the rules of one for the other you'll just screw yourself up.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou will find many things that are familiar.  The main dice mechanic, Beliefs, Instincts, Traits, Circles, advancing skills by using them and keeping track of tests, getting rewarded for playing to your traits and Beliefs and the idea of scripting in a conflict.  However, the implementation of those things is different than you will find in Mouse Guard.  Burning Wheel likes to give you more options for things.  People tend to either love it for the scope of what you can do or hate it because it is too complex.  I fall into the first camp myself for full disclosure though I like both games.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the major differences between them is that Mouse Guard is designed for cooperative play between a band of people dedicated to the same goal while Burning Wheel is designed for play where each player focuses on their own intertwined agendas and handles cooperative or competitive play equally well.  This is why I find the question of which is better to be impossible to answer.  Whether a baseball bat or a golf club is better really depends on what kind of game you will be playing that day.  The Burning Wheel forum has sample chapters and game reference sheets from Burning Wheel on their site.  If you haven't already, you might want to take a look and see if reading those can help make up your mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208851/#Comment_208851" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-24T06:53:42+00:00" title="May 24, 2009  6:53AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What other games do you play?

I would echo what others have said:  They are similar in mechanics but are quite different in the style of play they reinforce: <br><br>MG really focuses on teamwork. While there can be PvP situations, the main focus is the group and how they handle the tasks put before them. In many ways it's similar to traditional RPGs like D&amp;D where the party has a mission and purpose.<br/><br/>BW can do that but really encourages players to head in different directions or rub against each other - you literally can have four people all working at odds with each other in a scenario, although not necessarily overtly. It's perfect for those groups who like to play in a "group" but want to play a character with their own agenda and purpose. Teamwork can happen &amp; helps, but there's less of a mechanical benefit to it than MG.<br/><br/>In addition, MG tends to lend itself to less gritty conflicts (especially combat): Conflicts have consequences but are usually things you recover from.  In BW, you can have your head taken off by a single blow (figuratively or literally) if you're in over your head.  As a concrete example, last night my players faced off against a dire troll which is a  15' tall wall of muscle and hate with an appetite to go with it:  All of them knew that a single blow from the creature had the potential to be lethal and thus their getting in its path was a choice not to be taken lightly.  Were they in danger?  Yeah as in life or death because a superior hit from it would have killed any of them outright.  It was a very tense, cool situation and everyone who was involved got quite a rush out of the whole thing, especially because their lives were on the line. In the end they actually worked together and killed it (for the 2nd time but that's a different story).<br/><br/>BW has a very steep learning curve but it's one that be controlled somewhat by introducing the subsystems one at a time. It's also <span style="text-decoration: underline;">really</span> rewarding once it all comes together.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209103/#Comment_209103" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-26T11:04:48+00:00" title="May 26, 2009 11:04AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think probably the biggest meaningful difference between MG and BW is the structure of play.<br/><br/>MG play is built around teamwork, and various subsystems support that. For me, the secret sauce to MG is the Player Turn/GM Turn divide. This is a very tricky mode of play for experienced gamers to wrap their heads around (at least as tricky as the scene economy from Burning Empires...maybe moreso) but it definitely reinforces the "now we're doing things together" mindset.<br/><br/>BW play is much more akin to traditional RPGs, with lots of procedural support for conflict-driven play. Is it "too" complicated? Dunno. It's definitely more complicated than MG, but a lot of those complications are there to further support conflict-driven play. In other cases, I really do think the state of BW design has advanced in MG. For one, I'd really like to see an airtight conversion of the MG scripting system in BW -- I think it'd be an excellent halfway point between Fight!/DOW (the main points of contention for BW-haters) and Versus. <br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zipht" title="zipht"><img alt="zipht" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/173668_1770784817_2474986_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zipht">zipht</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209274/#Comment_209274" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-27T11:37:43+00:00" title="May 27, 2009 11:37AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Burning Wheel has the toolkit mentality.

I really love the intuitive mechanics of the MG conflict system. My main issue with trying to adapt it to BW is that it lacks the gritty, desperate finality of the Fight! system.  I just got an email from someone who just joined our BW campaign (a total noob to the system) and to quote him:  "That fight was awesome."   He really loved the brutality of things, especially the fact that death could come at any moment. Although the best part was when the troll threw one of the PCs through the brothel's front window. <img alt=":o" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/open_mouth.png" title=":o"/>)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209372">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209372/#Comment_209372" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-28T08:26:17+00:00" title="May 28, 2009  8:26AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Miso</cite>I remember reading that it is too complicated.</blockquote>\nBurning Wheel isn't more complicated than any other game out there (no more so than, say, Dark Heresy).  Where people get tripped up in approaching the game is that it does a lot of things differently than most roleplaying games, which people mislabel as complexity.  If you've enjoyed the style of play Mouse Guard supports, and like the things on which that games focuses (Beliefs, Instincts, Traits, character-driven play, relationships, etc.), they you'll probably enjoy Burning Wheel, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rpgfoo" title="rpgfoo"><img alt="rpgfoo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i55.photobucket.com/albums/g133/Miso_chin/Avatars/abstractavy.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rpgfoo">rpgfoo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209390/#Comment_209390" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-28T10:59:54+00:00" title="May 28, 2009 10:59AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for all your answers!<br/>\nIt seems to me that if you like the one you are likely to enjoy the other as well.<br/>\nAs I really like the game mechanics in MG because they are quite different from your standard rpg I'm sure that my money spend for BW (or BE) will not go to waste.<br/>\nTo summarize: Most of you don't consider it as "too complicated" but rather as being "complex" (without the pejorative meaning of the former one).
