He was on drums. I was on vocals. We were rockin' the Rock Band. And then we tried to play some Death Stakes at the same time. No change in difficulty level of course 'cause that would <i>not</i> be indiecockrockjapan.<br/><br/>IT IS FREAKING IMPOSSIBLE. I could only remember like tiny bits of his narration <i>because</i> I had to sing and wait 'til there were no vocals (or just speaky bits) to say anything myself, and I didn't really know the song. Or so I thought, the real reason was because it is just freaking impossible. I know this since he also found it impossible and he didn't have vocals.<br/><br/>Challenge: do it. Try it. At least it was hilariously fun how impossible it was.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
