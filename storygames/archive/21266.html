It starts your characters out as weaklings, neophytes, and apprentices, and the adventures that you go on are the formative experiences that shape you into a heroic figure. (Or you die in the process. Whichever.) The mechanics of the system do this staggeringly well, as you turn from a bumbling would-be adventurer to a powerful leader of men.<br/><br/>In contrast, a number of storygames start the characters out with a level of assumed power within the world. A reactionary design choice, I suppose, to the disempowerment of characters in more traditional games with a steep power curve. These games lack that bildungsroman effect. Oh, certainly, in Fate, you can play an <b>Apprentice Wizard</b> who rises to <b>Archmagus of the High College</b>, but it doesn't really affect gameplay directly. You could increase your skills by a point or two, gain more refresh, learn another stunt, and the fiction itself will change...but the character is still quite similar to when he first began the game. He still remains the highly competent character who suffers numerous setbacks to gather his Fate points only to spend them at an opportune time, allowing him to accomplish his goals.<br/><br/>Contrast to D&amp;D, where you go from fighting goblins to fighting balors. That goblin chieftain in Fate? He'll have a skill or two above the party's maximum, just enough to make him challenging to the party and deplete their Fate points. Same with the balor. (I'm picking on Fate here just a little bit, but this applies to more than one storygame. You understand the broader point I'm making, I am sure.)<br/><br/>Thus, my question to you is: are there any storygames that model the progression in the bildungsroman mechanically like D&amp;D? A level of vertical advancement (maybe not as pronounced), and one that has similar themes? The only one coming to mind is potentially Burning Wheel.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465930/#Comment_465930" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-26T21:48:25+00:00" title="August 26, 2017  9:48PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Shadow of Yesterday has a more compressed scale than D&amp;D, but it very much tells this kind of story, complete with a dramatic ending for your character.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chiarina" title="chiarina"><img alt="chiarina" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chiarina">chiarina</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465933/#Comment_465933" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-26T23:54:45+00:00" title="August 26, 2017 11:54PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The bildungsroman is a humanistic idea: A person not only becomes more competent, even more important is that the adolescent progresses in aesthetic comprehension of the world, strengthens his morality and shapes his intellectual capacities.<br/><br/>I think, a game with the only possibility for character progress to boost his skills is no good representation of a bildungsroman.<br/><br/>In my eyes, a bildungsroman is about changing: a child becomes an adult. But all the things, the adult represents, the child already owns, they only have to become aroused and refined.<br/><br/>In my eyes, Fate does a good job here.

I guess "D&amp;D" means lots of things, but it - in the incarnations I know - would not be my first choice for that kind of story. In a typical coming-of-age story we're not worried that Taran will be eaten by rats and have the clothing looted off his corpse his first day on the trail of the Horned King. <br/><br/>It's true that powerful starting characters is a reaction to the zero-to-hero grind to a certain extent. But even more I think it's a reaction to the '90s era meta-plot "observer style" play, where all the important stuff happens to or because of the NPCs, and the PCs are just there, sort of in the background, to witness important events and wade through tangentially-related combat encounters. <br/><br/>The bildungsroman is basically the Hero's Journey. Like <a href="/forums/profile/chiarina">@chiarina</a> says, the main point is that, regardless of whatever the character's starting situation, the journey brings about a shift in perspective, an epiphany of sorts, that the character either returns with to benefit the original world, or that he carries with him to transcendence. D&amp;D seems particularly bad at this; in D&amp;D, the more things change, the more they stay the same. <br/><br/>I think Sorcerer would actually work quite well for this, in spite of how it might seem at first glance. "Advancement" in Sorcerer consists of resolving the character's Kicker, which leads to *rewriting the character.* Taran could pretty easily be conceived of as a naive sorcerer. Frodo is clearly already a competent, self-assured, mature, adult Hobbit at the start of LOTR - maybe Lore 2 or even 3 - and he still undergoes a major transformation and transcendence as a result of his quest. <br/><br/>You can think of Kickers in Sorcerer a lot like you can think of the Stakes in Trollbabe: Gandalf's whole "call to adventure" in "The Shadow of the Past" is Frodo's Kicker. In Stakes terms, that's "Frodo claims the Ring as his own," or "Frodo throws the Ring into the fire." When Frodo does finally claim the Ring as his own, that resolves the Kicker, and Frodo gets rewritten. <br/><br/>The fluctuation of Humanity tracks the character's ongoing growth as he makes decisions about whatever it is that the game is about. <br/><br/>- N<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465949/#Comment_465949" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-27T16:56:05+00:00" title="August 27, 2017  4:56PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wrote The Academy to do this kind of things. <br/><br/>I think that TSoY does this well as well, as has already been mentioned above.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/emarsk" title="emarsk"><img alt="emarsk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/831/nTAGTUPOK6CW5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/emarsk">emarsk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465954/#Comment_465954" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-27T22:00:44+00:00" title="August 27, 2017 10:00PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 28, 2017 8:21AM by emarsk.">edited August 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just getting better at killing bigger things is not my idea of bildungsroman.<br/>I think <a href="http://station53.blogspot.it/2014/01/character-highlight-robert-e-howards.html" rel="nofollow">this Fate example</a> is a much better representation than any D&amp;D-esque number inflation.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465959/#Comment_465959" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-28T02:02:26+00:00" title="August 28, 2017  2:02AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana">@ValyrianSteelKatana</a> Yeah!

Both happen to reference the Harry Potter saga as one of their core sources.<br/><br/><i>The Dreaming Crucible</i> is about the metaphorical hero journey as a coming of age story as seen in non-swords&amp;sorcery literary fantasy (Peter Pan, Oz, Narnia...) and such 1980s fantasy films as Labyrinth.
