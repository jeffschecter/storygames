This should allow folks to finish and submit whatever they're doing for Jake's contest.<br/><br/>The weekend before, Aug 29-30, I will release info about the structure of the contest, but not the ingredients or theme.<br/><br/>Game Chef 2009 will accept competed games on four different deadlines: <br/><br/>- Monday Sept 7 (one week later), <br/>- Monday Sept 14 (two weeks later), <br/>- Wednesday Sept 30 (the last day of the month), and <br/>- right before the start of Game Chef 2010 (approx. one year later).<br/><br/>Participating chefs are encouraged to use these submission dates as milestones, interpreting them as they like (for example, I might do something like "basic playtest draft, revised draft, alpha, beta") and, furthermore, to resubmit games that have been significantly revised or improved between submission dates. Submitting games requires emailing me a link to a location where the game can be downloaded or purchased (yes, you can sell your GC games if you want, that's none of my business, though I don't necessarily suggest it, especially before the One Year deadline).<br/><br/>Note that, of course, you can just submit your game once and walk away.  There's no need to continue to develop a game that you may or may not be fully invested in, but some very vague structure will exist for those who do want to continue after the first week or two.<br/><br/>Cheers!  I will post more details on the structure of the contest and link to the new website as we get closer to the start date.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226562/#Comment_226562" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-21T12:54:06+00:00" title="August 21, 2009 12:54PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting.<br/><br/>Calendar marked.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_226643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226643/#Comment_226643" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-22T05:56:43+00:00" title="August 22, 2009  5:56AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, that's *half* the deadlines.

I was further inspired by the amount of time and energy that gets spent on judging an ever increasing number of games, time that would be much better spent, in my opinion, playing and revising the games after they have been created, not losing that momentum while we wait to find out who won (since being in the top tier of games is nice but doesn't necessarily mean anyone will ever play your game).<br/><br/>So we're going to try something a bit different this year. While there will not be formal judging per say, I am attempting to structure things so that it will still be possible to look at the results of the competition and judge, for oneself, which games are likely to be the most successful or, more importantly, the most interesting to YOU, games that you might want to play.<br/><br/>That said, this will be my first year running Game Chef and I'm anticipating an above-average amount of estrangement as I make a few changes and try to implement a new structure. Lord knows I complained enough to Andy over the years. Thankfully, I think the format and tradition of Game Chef is strong enough to survive a bit of meddling by the host.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226664">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226664/#Comment_226664" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-22T07:55:54+00:00" title="August 22, 2009  7:55AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't care about there being a winner (though Shreyas is right, it kind of makes the name weird).

The quick contests of the past have been great creative incentives, but there are many such contests these days, so perhaps its time to try something different.

Last few Game Chefs have been marked on a peer review system rather than a panel of judges, something I've never been fond of myself because there's always a certain degree of subjectivity involved in reviewing any game. Sadly with the number of entries seen these days, having a single panel of judges just hasn't been viable, and peer review was the only workable solution.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_226890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226890/#Comment_226890" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-23T06:46:39+00:00" title="August 23, 2009  6:46AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Chris, if you're still laboring under the idea that Game Chef should produce long-term viable games, then you're sadly deluded.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/commondialog" title="commondialog"><img alt="commondialog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/commondialog">commondialog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226927/#Comment_226927" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-23T11:41:39+00:00" title="August 23, 2009 11:41AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan,<br/><br/>I'm actually excited to see how all this plays out.

Ben was totally right in the "war stories" thread when he opined that Game Chef should fit into the free time you already have in your life.  After all, even if you're super busy, you could still write an awesome 2-4 page game.  Creating extra space for Game Chef just puts more pressure on yourself and that's not really the point.  You're not painting the Mona Lisa here, you're writing a short draft of a game concept and hopefully getting the chance to play it with your friends.  If it works well, you can always add to it later.  Just my advice.<br/><br/>Jonathan                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tadk" title="tadk"><img alt="tadk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nAYGI7O6LI2LV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tadk">tadk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228586/#Comment_228586" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-29T10:17:36+00:00" title="August 29, 2009 10:17AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite><img alt="image" src="http://www.meekmok.com/sassy/images/yo_dawg.jpg"/></blockquote>\nYes<br/>Ohh Yes<br/><br/>Awesome                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228609/#Comment_228609" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-29T14:40:59+00:00" title="August 29, 2009  2:40PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is that illustration from Elfs?

If Jonathan finds it agreeable, and the new event structure will work with it, I'll likely run a side contest, much like some of those that ran last year, and I hope some other people will do the same.<br/><br/>As a reminder, side contests usually focused on one feature of the games (e.g. best feminist game). Peer reviewers nominated games that were felt to fit and be worthy of recognition. The judges for the side contests then read the nominated games and selected winners.<br/><br/>So, what do you think? Does it go against the new spirit of Game Chef, or would this add to the fun?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228632/#Comment_228632" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-29T19:40:44+00:00" title="August 29, 2009  7:40PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 29, 2009 7:42PM by J_Walton.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have no control or claim over anything that anyone decides to do outside of participating in Game Chef along the "official" lines.

I'm just trying to draw the lines really clearly about where my responsibilities begin and end.  I don't want to be in a position where people want me to approve side contests or whatever.  I just organize the official parts of the competition.  The unofficial stuff is, uh, unofficial. Do as thou wilt.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228633">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228633/#Comment_228633" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-29T19:52:44+00:00" title="August 29, 2009  7:52PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            P.P.S. One thing I will say is you probably want to wait until the ingredients and medals and such are announced before you announce any unofficial contests.  Say, for example, one of the ingredients is "giant wasps" and one of the medals is "write a game that fits on a business card."  You might decide to read all the games that hit both those requirements, however many there are, and rank them on MacLean's Waspy Business Top Ten.  The new tagging system should make it really easy to find games that fit any combination of "official" traits.  If you wanna announce an unofficial contest that people have to nominate their games for, with whatever requirements you like, you could definitely do that too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228647/#Comment_228647" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-29T21:18:38+00:00" title="August 29, 2009  9:18PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite> one of the medals is "write a game that fits on a business card." </blockquote>\nThat sounds like a pretty awesome goal, although I'm not sure what kinds of designs you could fit into that kind of restraint.

Next year <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  I definitely agree in principle that the design is a bit more cluttered than I'd like, but I don't have time to re-do the whole thing by Monday, so we're stuck with it for 2009.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tim Gray</cite>Would it not have been about a thousand times simpler to get some friendly forum to start a board for this?</blockquote>\nNope. It's my personal experience that forums actually become an impediment to getting things done once their membership swells beyond a certain reasonable size. They become, not a social supplement to the task of designing games, but a distraction from it. Up until 2005, Game Chef took place on a single thread; clearly we can't go back to that but I'm trying to cut back on the bloat and make it easier for folks to sort through stuff they aren't interested in reading while still offering support to newcomers. Plus, this means that it's not Game Chef's responsibility to make sure our archives are around forever, something that Andy clearly wanted. Game Chef now takes place on the internet, like everything else, and not in a separate little ghetto -- which'll hopefully lead to less complaining that the geezers' whining about New Game Chef is pissing into the pool or that these newcomers are all XYZ. Everyone is responsible for their own experience of Game Chef.  In fact, if there wasn't already a theme for this Game Chef, that would be it: "personal responsibility Game Chef."  Consequently, it exists on your own web space and not on mine or Game Chef's; it's all up to you.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tim Gray</cite>I don't understand the top bit about icons having the ague.</blockquote>\nThat would be "Icon Intrigue," the title of this year's Game Chef.  You'll know what it means by tomorrow.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: hansel</cite>Let's see how it goes, shall we?</blockquote>\nYes indeed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228706/#Comment_228706" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-30T09:31:06+00:00" title="August 30, 2009  9:31AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, RSS feeds are live.

Believe me, if that passage was much shorter, I'd have a bunch more folks hopping on me asking questions.<br/><br/>As for your first request, I'm not going to defend the way I'm running Game Chef to you, at least no more than I already have (see above).  If you don't see the value in participating, I'm not sure what else I can say to convince you.  You don't have to start a blog or participate in the social aspects of Game Chef if you don't want to.  You can just write a game and submit it.<br/><br/>If you're looking for the specific instructions on writing and submitting a game, they haven't been posted yet.  They're going up late tonight.

Providing a community(forum) doesn't necessarily make a community. That takes more work (perhaps even 10 x more work. <br/><br/>As for whether it will work or not, well lets just say, its not simple ignorance that keeps people out of the wonder that is the blogosphere. Among the culprits include , hatred of blogs, the extra work it takes to meaningfully contribute to a blogosphere (which generally includes keeping your own blog and responding to others ), the Celebrity problem (ie blogs are for the most part a one direction medium (from the blog writter to the public) and I've yet to see good communication come from a medium who's main method is shouting at the masses (you can get arround this with emails or having the masses shout back, or whatever, ). <br/><br/>Anyway this is probably more bitching than is probably appropiate, On the other side checking the aggregation feed (or as I like to call it , angry gator feed) has become somewhat compulsive, in a very boring, hi guys kinda way that marks the start of the game chefs I've been to so far...<br/><br/>Best of Luck,                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228739/#Comment_228739" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-30T12:25:25+00:00" title="August 30, 2009 12:25PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 30, 2009 12:27PM by C_Edwards.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seriously.

You can also see the last ten posts on which replies are made, to which you've already replied.<br/>To do the former, when you read a blog you get to see your dashboard at the top, under "This Blog" choose "Subscribe to blog", you can read it under "Blog Surfer" on your Dashboard.

I can even point you to threads where I complained, in vain, to Andy about it.  So I definitely feel your pain, no question.  Here's the thing, though: this is how Game Chef is running this year.  It's too late, all the decisions have been made and a lot of work has gone into making it work this way.  If that means that this isn't your year to participate, that's fine.  I'm sorry for it, but there's nothing I can really do for you about big, structural issues.  Smaller stuff, sure, I'm willing to be flexible and have already adapted a few things to respond to specific people's requests.  This is me running Game Chef the best way I know how.  All I ask in return is that you participate in Game Chef in the best way you know how... or don't participate.  I don't think that's unfair.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228743">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228743/#Comment_228743" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-30T12:39:00+00:00" title="August 30, 2009 12:39PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, everyone and their dog has a vanilla forum and it's really easy to set one up.

Out of fairness, I'm not participating this year, so please don't take my trying to help you as mindless endorsement of something you may feel is the worst thing to ever happen to the indie game community, or whatever. The only thing I'm a fan of is clear communication, so don't kill the messenger or debate with me whether these points are valid, because I do not have an investment one way or another, and we will only know for certain if the goals were achieved once Game Chef is over.<br/><br/>That said:<br/><br/>* In what way does it benefit the designer?<br/><br/>The tagging system is supposed to make it easier for people to find and play your games AFTER GameChef, and make it easier to browse games you're interested in and ignore things you're disinterested in. It's easier to wade through a bunch of single words than it is to wade through a bunch of forum threads. The people who find your stuff during the competition will have been looking for something similar to what you're doing, and therefore are more likely to comment and be helpful.<br/><br/><br/>* In what way does it benefit the audience?<br/><br/>See the stuff about tagging. You can go through and find games that are using the same ingredients you're using, aren't jeepform, and need help. As an example.<br/><br/><br/>* In what way has my participation in the event been improved?<br/><br/>You don't have to be "Distracted" by the social space and can concentrate on your game more thoroughly, without feeling like there's a vital part of GC you're sitting out of if forums aren't your thing. You can keep your head down and finish your game. <br/><br/><br/>* In what way will superior designs arise?<br/><br/>The answer Jonathan would probably endorse would be "without the distractions of the forum and the social posturing, the designs will be better, and the GC site will offer more robust support for people working on their games when the competition is over and getting them to a more baked state." My answer? It's not GC's job to magically make superior designs through cunning manipulation of social and electronic resources. Your design will be as good as the work you feel like putting into it.<br/><br/>That's one of the main reasons I'm not competing this year, actually. I have enough games to work on right now without sacrificing more mental space to work on yet another design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228754/#Comment_228754" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-30T13:06:18+00:00" title="August 30, 2009  1:06PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite><cite>Posted By: R00kie</cite>why do<b>none</b>of the<i>Freshman Mixer</i>posts appear on<i>The Great Conbobulator</i>?</blockquote>\nHmm, I'll check that out and get back to you.

I apologize if you were indeed being sincere and for dismissing your questions as part of the inevitable bickering.<br><br>The RSS feed aggregation is, in my mind, a halfway house between where Game Chef has been and where I'd like it to be.  Ideally, in the future, I'd like Game Chef to operate just like other small game design challenges (Lil' Game Chef, Jake's Fantasy game contest, etc.) where Game Chef has <i>zero</i> responsibility for hosting participants in any way, be it a forum or a blog community or whatever, aside from maybe providing a place where newcomers can meet each other and build support networks.  In that kind of situation, "unofficial" modes of support would be the only modes that existed at all.  People could start their own mini-forums and invite a dozen people to design with them.  Groups could form in IRC or other chat situations.  People could use the blogs and networks they already have, etc.  I felt like we couldn't get those kinds of unofficial support organs organized in time this year and it seemed unfair to just kick people out into the cold last minute, hence the current RSS aggregation set up. But I think if Game Chef is going to survive, prosper, and grow in the long run, it needs to be as a hub and headquarters for a bunch of interactions of various kinds that are happening in different forms all over the web, not as a giant forum with 200 people participating for just two weeks.<br><br>Does that help at all?

After externalizing those functions, is there something left, aside from an arbitrarily set deadline and game design topic people may or may not wish to care about? Should the name of the event be changed into "Game Chef Week" to emphasize how it's just a suggested week for game design about a suggested topic with a suggestion of self-organizing into feedback teams or whatever if that sort of thing floats your boat?<br><br>Also, for what it's worth, I stopped caring about IGC when participation became an elaborate matter of forum memberships and feedback teams. My favourite form for the competition was always the single thread on a single forum, with arbitrary and personal judges. So from that viewpoint I'm very excited about Jonathan's vision, even if I don't quite see the relevance of the stripped-down competition right now. Probably going to participate still, this is the best I've seen this competition be in years.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228779/#Comment_228779" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-30T14:37:18+00:00" title="August 30, 2009  2:37PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, this is definitely a transition year, so I'm not sure yet what my vision for Game Chef ultimately is.  Most likely, once October rolls around I'll have a much better idea.  I think you're right that one thread, with 8-20 entries and arbitrary judging, is the best model we've seen. The small numbers of people definitely allow you to build closer relationships with other designers and the single thread keeps the blabbing and off-topic stuff to a minimum.  You focus on making games but you also feel the community without it getting in your way.<br><br>I was talking to Ben about judging the other day.  When Mike was just semi-arbitrarily picking a winner he liked, it just meant "Mike's wrong" (in the minds of non-winners) or became pressure to improve your game ("he has a point there").  When everybody involved in Game Chef began voting for winners or if a cabal of cool game designers judged games, if your game didn't place in the top ten (or 5 or 3), you could easily come to the false conclusion that your game sucked.  You were wrong about your game's merits, instead of Mike being wrong.  And I think that makes for a less friendly social environment, if you're competing for the attention and respect of your fellow designers even more than the normal amount.<br><br>In any case, I'm still having lots of discussions about Game Chef with various folks, including right here in this thread.  It's not like my mind is made up and I know exactly what I want it to eventually be.  Right now, I'm just pointing it in the direction I want it to go, trying to avoid major disasters, and seeing what happens.  Clearly there will be course adjustments along the way.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228780/#Comment_228780" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-30T14:38:21+00:00" title="August 30, 2009  2:38PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>an arbitrarily set deadline and game design topic</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Aren't these things what GC is FOR?

Might be just me that's messed up, but I do think that I understand how somebody might be reluctant to start a new blog just to participate in something like this. It doesn't bother me, as I already have a blog, but when the competition was forum-based, I didn't much consider participating. It's some atavistic need to not leave trails in the Internet, I don't really understand the psychology myself. Perhaps it has something to do with the social statement you make by participating: even if your participation is only making an user account and never posting anything, it's still a sort of vote of acceptance (or perhaps commitment?) for the system you registered in. A topic for different thread, that - I don't really know how to treat it, except by keeping the contest right at a place where I'm already registered, like at the Forge, Story Games or the blogosphere. Doesn't help anybody outside those places, of course.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tadk" title="tadk"><img alt="tadk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nAYGI7O6LI2LV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tadk">tadk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228784/#Comment_228784" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-30T15:14:16+00:00" title="August 30, 2009  3:14PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My thanks to you Jonathan for taking this all on.

When I add new blogs to the aggregator, generally it only aggregates the first post immediately and it takes a little while for the others to trickle through.  I assume it's the same for other posts.  Honestly, I kinda like this slight delay, as opposed to the immediate gratification of forums.  Hopefully it gives folks' pause to actually think about what they're posting.<br/><br/>Guy is right, Ash.  You can pretty easily change your settings so that most posts automatically go through.  Honestly, I like having to approve posts, but if you hate it, it's pretty easy to change it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228874/#Comment_228874" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T07:19:38+00:00" title="August 31, 2009  7:19AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Feeds usually update once an hour, the feed aggregator can be told how often to check for new posts, sometimes.<br/><br/>Default IIRC is one hour, if yer post isn't up on the feed an hour after it was posted than maybe something's wrong.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228881/#Comment_228881" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T07:42:23+00:00" title="August 31, 2009  7:42AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Combobulator is set to check posts "all the time," which may mean once per hour.

On the plus side, the category feed for the Freshman Mixer and the Crying Wolfman feed seem to be working just fine, as does the tag cloud.  <br/><br/>We just hit somewhere near 50 participating blogs and I would not be surprised to have 20 more by the end of the day.  All in all, I think we can expect slightly fewer participants and submitted games than the past couple years (82 completed games in 2007, 76 in 2008), but I think that is just continuing drop off from the 2007 peak. The new Artist First format last year and the new changes this year are bound to discourage some folks, but I imagine things will pick up once GC settles into a more regular format and stops being dramatically different year to year.  Still, it's a bit too early to count games, so this year may yet explode, numbers-wise.<br/><br/>I'm also interested to see the ultimate badges spread, of course, because that'll give me some good feedback on what kinds of restrictions / suggestions people find the most useful.  Some of the badges are intentionally a bit out there and it'll be neat to see if anyone decides to go for them or if they will remain unclaimed.  I really like the optional restrictions because it enables me, as the "designer" of the game that is Game Chef, to throw out a few "test" badges, like the test questions on th SAT, both for fun but also to learn about what people want.<br/><br/>All in all, though, an exciting start.

Game Chef does not approve of anything that gets posted on individual blogs.  Just like on the internet or in real life, if you have a problem with what someone says, you can certainly tell them so, without needing me to step in.  That said, sure, if folks start regularly spouting hate speech instead of (or while) designing a game, I'll certainly step in and remove their blog from the aggregator.  For now, I'll keep my eye on the situation and assume that particular poster is moving on to the real work of designing a game and not ranting about Mr. Wick.

This built neat little communities that I enjoyed muchly.  Go Team Omega (GC '07)!  I miss that.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> I got no substantive feedback from any of the Game Chef contestants during the first week.  I got a couple nice atta boys, which was cool.  I went "off list" and spoke at length with a few people I trust and respect on my game design because I have trouble working in a vacuum.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> I skimmed other games and blogs, but gave very little feedback to the designers.  Not out of any bad emotion, just nothing grabbed me and asked for input and I found myself coming back to my own game instead.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a> I actually turned in a basically finished game in the first week, which is freaking amazing for me.  I have already playtested the game once and will be playtesting it again tonight. <br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%235&amp;Mode=like">#5</a> I didn't do the Big Three questions or any soul searching this year.  I just took the ingredients, came up with a concept and started running with it, devising things as I wrote them down.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how the observations above relate to each other, if they do at all.

But it was my hope all along that cutting back on some of the socializing would lead to less waffling and indecision (post something, wait to see what people think, weigh a bunch of different suggestions, then move to the next step of design) and more pushing through to actually get games finished and play them.  But I'll be interested to see what other folks' experiences are like (both this week and over the rest of the month) before evaluating this year's challenge and figuring out where Game Chef goes from here.<br/><br/>I do think there's probably some room in the future, assuming we continue with the RSS feed aggregation, for subdividing folks into smaller groups aside from just Freshman Mixer + everyone else (The Zoo).  I'm not sure what those categories would be, to make them useful without making them into cliques or ghettos. Maybe base them on the medals, so you can easily find everybody doing zombie games?  I'm not sure how much people are using the tags to navigate, but we could definitely make that more prominent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230403/#Comment_230403" name="Item_129" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-07T10:30:10+00:00" title="September  7, 2009 10:30AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, one possibility which people didn't seem to jump on (but it was totally left out there) was for folks interested in the social aspects, the peer feedback and feedback groups, to set up such an arrangement themselves: Perhaps ask for folks interested, then start up an email list or Google Group for the contest, or perhaps create a forum somewhere (maybe ask over at 1km1kt).<br/><br/>What I noticed in years past is that when I created feedback groups and even participated in them anonymously, I enjoyed reading and giving feedback to folks, but I don't think I really helped them in a significant way (maybe that's just me). And my cycle of design with my games (notably Hegemony and Take Back of Freedom) was "no inspiration no inspiration no inspiration no inspiration no inspiration SUDDEN BOLT OF INSPIRATION; IGNORE FORUMS COMPLETELY UNTIL GAME DRAFT IS TOTALLY DONE, usually at 11:50PM on the last night of the contest". So I didn't make much use of my own feedback groups, I'm afraid. Although when I did toss out a question or an idea, I usually did get people chiming in. But while I saw that others were clearly getting helpful input and feedback on their designs, I personally came to realize that the process tended to get in my way of finishing a game on time (especially because of my work schedule and the like).<br/><br/>Since it was clear to me that feedback groups help some people and hinder others, I figured that writing them out officially, but leaving room for people to organize such feedback circles themselves, was the way to go. <br/><br/>However, it seems that maybe I didn't shout that publicly enough ("HEY YOU! You want a feedback group? Make one! People with similar interests and needs WILL join you, and get involved!"). I saw folks complain online here and there that their ideas didn't get a lot of feedback or commentary. Some thought it was because they were a "nobody" in the social hierarchy of game chef or something; but that's just plain bullshit. The reason folks didn't get commentary is because that's not what the blogroll was for: The blogroll is a chance for folks to keep their own pace, to blow their own horn about what they're working on, the steps they climbed. If folks were looking for support, feedback, or insight, they should have organized with other participants to create small communities of support (even if it was nothing more than a pact between 3-10 people who promise to read each others' blogs and respond) so they would get the feedback they were looking for. <br/><br/>All in all, good lessons to remember for next year's contest. I'll try to beat the drum early and loud of, "Feedback groups are great!

Why would anyone need to create a separate forum for discussions when you can have discussions right on the blog posts?<br/><br/><br/>Yeah, this is how I feel. It makes sense to me now to create a separate forum for feedback; but as a person participating in GC for the first time and hearing about the groups from previous years, I sort of assumed part of the point of GC was to create these groups for you. I have no problem taking initiative and doing it myself; I just thought that the blogroll format was supposed to be doing it for me--being a newbie, it wasn't clear. I had expectations for things that GC was not trying to offer me. Now that I know that it was <i>not</i> designed to do that, I can make a more informed choice about whether I want to try to create a feedback community.<br/><br/>Honestly, I feel like I'm spending about as much time writing on other people's blogs as I am on my own, and I'm not getting the feedback I'd like. But a lot of what Andy says makes sense: It's nice to have the blog to keep my own pace, and comments won't necessarily be more helpful than just working on my game on my own (though I have had a few that were incredibly helpful. Maybe that's all I really need).<br/><br/>All in all, I feel good about what's going on in GC this year. It's been a learning experience so far, and I've had to adjust some expectations, but it's really great.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230425">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230425/#Comment_230425" name="Item_132" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-07T13:43:04+00:00" title="September  7, 2009  1:43PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: hansel</cite>It's been a learning experience so far, and I've had to adjust some expectations, but it's really great.</blockquote>\nI think I just met my victory conditions. <br/><br/>It's fascinating that many participants judge how successful Game Chef was for them by <i>the number of comments they get about their game</i>, not how good their game is in play or how much they learned in the process or what their game is like 6 months from now. What that signals to me is that many folks participate in Game Chef primarily to make connections or plug into a pre-existing community (which may or may not exist, in the way they imagine it) that they want to be a more prominent part of, in addition to having the experience of designing a game. And that's totally understandable.  That's what participating in the early Game Chef challenges did for me (I'm semi-well-known despite having <i>done nothing of significance</i>).  <br/><br/>But I don't think any of the folks who've run Game Chef can be responsible for making those connections happen. Honestly, I have no idea why some posts get comments and some don't. Maybe folks are too busy, not interested, turned off by something you said, have limited amounts of time, are attracted by posts with pretty pictures, or a dozen different other things. In past years, some feedback groups were great while some were not so great. Why? Who knows. I'm not sure we could replicate that success if we tried. If those connections happen, then they happen.  If they don't happen, it needs to not be Game Chef's fault, which I think means that GC should play as little of a social planning role as possible. But Andy's right that, this year, we didn't do as good a job of promoting the "if something's missing / broken, you can fix it yourself, without needing official GC permission / support" attitude. I'll try to make a post later that specifically calls that out, since we still have the rest of the month to go.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230427">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230427/#Comment_230427" name="Item_133" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-07T13:52:10+00:00" title="September  7, 2009  1:52PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've always participated in Game Chef, not for the social connection, but for the feedback process.

Is that correct? If so, then:<br/><br/>Awesome.<br/><br/>Furthermore, I think you have a high chance of succeeding at putting together a feedback team/group/organization. <br/><br/>It's perhaps too late this year for the folks aiming for the one week (done!)/two week medals to put together "ongoing comments/commentary feedback" as people write and blog about their ideas.<br/><br/>But creating a community of feedback for folks who have completed their entries (be it week, 2-week, month, year, etc) would totally work, especially since there is absolutely no rush. Starting the post-completion feedback cycle now or a month from now won't adversely affect the people who already completed their entries, so there's no breakneck rush to slap something together. Plan it out, organize, and I'm sure you can make it work.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230432/#Comment_230432" name="Item_135" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-07T14:11:58+00:00" title="September  7, 2009  2:11PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham, there are specific awards for giving good feedback this year, and people have been giving them out, so I don't think I would be a total alarmist yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230434/#Comment_230434" name="Item_136" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-07T14:15:50+00:00" title="September  7, 2009  2:15PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I'm totally not saying that.

My positive experiences of SG community stem from the type of interaction that i see here at S-G, and had hoped to find some more active level of cross-talk during development.  I've gotten a handful of comments and hopefully left twice as many.  the contest isn't as social as my expectations had been.  As JW says, there's no reason that I (or we) can't be providing that for ourselves.<br/><br/>also, tagging.  I'm doing it but not using it for anything other than organization on my site.  mostly, i'm feeding a handful of games that i'm keenly interested in how they're developing and reading the rest of the blog-roll; making occasional comments.

I was hoping that, without the contest aspect, folks would have to get excited about actually writing a game, rather than focusing on winning, but I can understand feeling dispirited when that excitement just doesn't seem to materialize.<br/><br/>Hans... I'm glad it is working for you and apparently some other folks too.  It'll definitely be very difficult to assess how the changes played out, since comparing one year to another is like apples and oranges in many ways.  Is it about having the most games completed? Is it about people making the most connections? Is it about the new folks having a great experience? Is it about games being played or being "good" (however you assess that)?  And if some things haven't been great, is it the social structure or the ingredients or something else that's causing the difficulties?<br/><br/>We'll have to unwind in October and have a discussion about all of that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_231431">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231431/#Comment_231431" name="Item_149" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-10T17:26:41+00:00" title="September 10, 2009  5:26PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Speaking personally, and big ups to Jonathan for taking on the GC responsibility, but I'd personally rather cultivate new relationships that help me with multiple ideas down the line (and expose me to new lines of awesomeness down the line) then end up with yet another game that's kinda playable and I could playtest if I wanted. I don't think that this is a bad thing, but I think that I'm just no longer the kind of person GC is for.<br/><br/>If you've had trouble finishing things in the past (not just for Game Chef), work well without feedback and competition, and would rather have one game than a lot of convenient exposure to new people and ideas, GC in its current incarnation is tailor-made, and that's great. It'd <i>also</i> be great if someone stepped up to do a competition that'd make a good home for those of us currently out in the cold, too.<br/><br/>Also, I'm really disappointed in you, Jonathan.

I respect that decision.  However, I think it might be a bit premature to write off GC entirely just based on one contest that I basically threw together in a month.  I'm just getting used to running this thing and, with one contest under my belt and an opportunity to see how some of the changes played out, hopefully I can make something that better serves a number of very different audiences with very different needs next year.  Instead of concluding that "GC isn't for me anymore," I would appreciate it if folks would give me the benefit of the doubt and make their decisions about Game Chef on a year-to-year basis, at least until it's clear that GC has settled into a format that doesn't work for them.  Right now, I don't think we've settled into anything, necessarily.<br/><br/>The hardest thing about running Game Chef is trying to decide what the core of the experience really is.  Game Chef has meant a lot of different things to a lot of different people over the years and it pains me -- I mean I honestly feel deeply sad -- that it's so difficult (maybe even impossible) to make GC consistently serve the needs and desires of everyone that wants to be a part of it.  Maybe that means GC will end up having a rotating format, serving different sets of interests on alternate years, I don't know.  But please know that I do care about this and I wish I could make GC everything everyone wants it to be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

You can't go home, and for all I know there simply isn't any form of IGC I could relate to aside from one where I get to be a grouchy and unfair judge and not design anything myself. Doesn't mean that others who are in different places can't enjoy the competition.<br/><br/>Still, as Jonathan seems to take feedback seriously, something substantial: the topic this year didn't click for me. I know that the topics have gone less and less substantial as time has gone by, but I'd still hope for the topic to be a genre of literature or something like that - something that I can have a creative stance towards. This year I tried to discern the difference between the topic and ingredients and failed; as far as I understood, this intrigue topic was just an extra ingredient.

Right now, I don't think we've settled into anything, necessarily.<br/></blockquote>\nOkay, I really apologize for misunderstanding and, as I tried to express above, I think it's awesome that GC has been successful for some people this year, and I too am not the center of the universe. But especially with some of the things you've repeated about how GC has gotten too big and cannot be responsible for the things I specifically found useful about GC in the past, I thought you were speaking about GC as a year-to-year entity and not specifically about this year's contest.

In actuality, I was developing the game as I wrote until I hit the first draft.<br/><br/>I can see your point, Dan.  I posted "in character", so it may have seemed I wasn't asking for help directly.  At the end of several posts, I did ask if anyone had questions, which was how I was piercing the fourth wall, but its obvious this wasn't clear. <br/><br/>Still though, I thought the medal of "most helpful" might have motivated more people to jump in and ask questions.  I know I jumped in and asked questions about people's submitted drafts even though they had submitted them.<br/><br/>But I get what you're saying about my expectations.  Thanks for the feedback.<br/><br/>As for your request for playtesting, I thought it was a good idea, but I don't personally have the time for it right now, so I didn't want to reply negatively and kill the thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232232/#Comment_232232" name="Item_160" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-14T09:21:01+00:00" title="September 14, 2009  9:21AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: orklord</cite>Still though, I thought the medal of "most helpful" might have motivated more people to jump in and ask questions.

I am completely new to RPG design so the "thought I could help" part of that is a big barrier for me. I think I'm a reasonably good writer and would probably be able to help people with editing, but most people get really annoyed if you offer them editing suggestions before they're ready for them, so the "thought they wanted it" part kicks in there. I'd be willing to go over your draft and see if I have any suggestions, but it seems like you've already got a volunteer from your Forge thread, so I'm not sure if you want/need more help or not.\n<blockquote>As for your request for playtesting, I thought it was a good idea, but I don't personally have the time for it right now, so I didn't want to reply negatively and kill the thread.</blockquote>\nYeah, I didn't expect everybody to get involved, that's a perfectly reasonable reaction. I was mostly posting that as a kind of general status update, and also to remind people that creating their own subgroups is possible. I suspect that if you put out the offer of creating a mutual-critique group that you'd get people who wanted to participate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232244/#Comment_232244" name="Item_161" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-14T10:14:27+00:00" title="September 14, 2009 10:14AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Dan</b>,<br/><br/>partly because English is not my first language, I'd <b>love </b>to hear any editing suggestions you can spare.<br/><br/>Unless that's simply too painful to behold, feel free to comment as harshly as needed on my alpha draft of <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/sitodirafu/Home/Intrigue_onboard_the_Fleur-de-lis.alpha.pdf?attredirects=0" rel="nofollow">Intrigue onboard the Fleur-de-lis</a> or, for that matter, any draft I've written or am going to write, ever.  ^__^                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232245/#Comment_232245" name="Item_162" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-14T10:17:26+00:00" title="September 14, 2009 10:17AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dan Maruschak</cite>I have tried to offer help to people where I thought they wanted it and where I thought I could help.
