Failing that, speed chess, Backgammon, Fox and Geese, Nine-Man Morris or of course Hnefatafl are all options - basically anything a bit old-fashioned would work.

The problem with doing that is that you're actually reducing realism and adventurability of the adventure if you insist that everything in this <i>module</i> you're running has to conform to <i>your</i> preconceptions. You are not that wizard, you are not the ghost, you are not James Raggi. You are merely presenting the facts as they lay on the ground.<br/><br/>A more useful approach to making sense of other people's adventures is teleological constructive thinking: <i>given that</i> these are the facts, what might have brought the situation about? Of course you adapt an adventure to your setting and whatnot, but these sorts of details - it's just not a very good campaign setting if it can't handle other people's adventure details at all when they clash with your own assumptions.<br/><br/>Also, about half of the reasons for using an adventure module boil down to not having to do your own prep, which enables you to improvise more naturally. You'll ruin that if your attitude towards an adventure module is to carefully, ever so carefully study it and forensically nit-pick it to death in advance. I'm not saying that it's wrong to prepare well (some people and social situations simply can't handle spontaneity), but it is very easy to have your prep become value-laden as you visualize how given encounters should go in your own personal headspace. Building those firm preconceptions about how encounters will go is unhygienic, because you're in danger of influencing events in play to make them match your preconceptions, or of being disappointed and becoming unstable as a referee if the players don't magically mind-read you to achieve your expected approach.<br/><br/>With all that being said, there are a huge array of possibilities for how and why the ghost could be there and acting that way at this moment in time, if you go into it with the assumption that it in fact is there and you want to know the reason, instead of assuming that maybe it's not there because it doesn't make sense. For example:<br/>- This is just how ghosts work in the setting, and the stargazer is tickled pink about having one in his library as a sign of prestige.<br/>- The ghost is supposed to act differently, but it's broken due to lack of maintenance.<br/>- The stargazer doesn't know about the ghost, which has appeared recently due to the constant increase of ozone in the tower after the lightning-creation system was left permanently on. Maybe ghosts only show up in ozone-rich environments.<br/>- The wizard prizes his chess skills and looks down upon the hoi polloi for their lack of sophistication; it amuses his egoistic personality (he's a successful wizard, of course he's full of himself) to have an entrance exam that others can't pass while he can. It's true that it takes some time every time he wants to get into the library, but he enjoys it as a break from his routines. Sort of like somebody who peculiarly insists on having a rope ladder entrance into their apartment because they're just that aesthetic about their lifestyle.<br/>- The ghost doesn't require the entrance exam from people who have conclusively beat it in the past (maybe it looks at your respective ELO ratings, and anybody with a 1000:1 advantage over it gets a free pass.), and thus the wizard doesn't need to be playing every time he wants to use the library; the ghost will just cover from his superior puissance.<br/><br/>The most important point, though, is that you're not the wizard, you're not the ghost, so you're not primarily responsible for defending their actions in the court of sensibility. You're merely responsible for judging whether a person with those actions could conceivably exist in your setting, or if everybody always does the rationally sensible armchair theory thing in there. Maybe it's that kind of setting, I don't know - in that case one might swap the ghost for a lock, or assume the wizard doesn't know about the ghost at all. That sort of setting will make it difficult for the players to ever be surprised by the unknown and unexpected, though, so I'd consider it twice before going that way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428937/#Comment_428937" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-28T12:45:53+00:00" title="February 28, 2014 12:45PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It feels to me like the wine bottle that kills you is unfair.

What's next, are you going to remove the lightning trap because electricity doesn't work that way, too?<br/><br/>Maybe magic reacts with antioxidants in wine to produce a subtle poison when wine is exposed to the thaumic field for extended periods of time. There, that's your excuse for why a wine bottle has spoiled in such a lethal manner, and it wasn't hard. Now when your players try to nitpick themselves out of death, you can instead offer them an interesting long-term bit of setting lore, one that can easily be turned around to benefit them: they could start producing their own poison now that they have a pretty strong hint about how such might be accomplished, which poison depending on the setting might be almost unique in its potency and useful qualities. (Poison has historically been much more rare, weak and difficult to produce than it is in Gygaxian D&amp;D.)<br/><br/>Or you could just do a little bit of constructive fixing and assume that the poisoned bottle was put there by the Stargazer. If I were an international man of mystery science like him, I would certainly keep a bottle of wine poisoned with undetectable poison in my hamper for the "special" guests.<br/><br/>Besides, worrying about the fairness of the danger is extremely unhygienic when you're designing a scenario (which you're clearly doing, considering how you're fixing it instead of working with it). I could be wrong about your thought process here, but to me it reads like your primary issue with this wine bottle is that it causes a poison save vs. death, and death's too harsh. Why do you know this to be the case? Particularly, your arguments about expecting danger do not apply: there is no reason why every peril should be avoidable by cleverly expecting it. To the contrary, this idea that dangers are only fair when they can be expected is another form of GM preconception: you're basically saying that you're the guru of danger-expecting, and know best which dangers the players should be able to anticipate. This is just cruelly insulting upon the players: think of what they'll feel if they fail to mind-read you successfully and step into one of your calibrated traps that were never supposed to go off because you expected "more" from them. By turning every time their characters step into some amusing hazard into a moment of "you should've known that it's coming" you make the game much less fun, psychologically speaking. Besides, it's again utterly unrealistic to have all dangers be avoidable; attrition is the first principle of the art of war, according to Clausewitz.<br/><br/>However, the problem could well be with your rules instead of the scenario: I personally think that the save vs. death mechanics in old school D&amp;D are a smidgen too lethal, which is why I've revised them to be sort of sadistically semi-lethal instead, so that there's a lot of leeway for midway outcomes between shrugging it off and dying of it. I also tend to use rules akin to 3rd edition D&amp;D, where saving throws are graded like skill checks on their difficulty. Due to these changes to procedure I could easily enough have characters just get violently ill from drinking that wine. Jim Raggi couldn't anticipate my procedural direction in matters like these, of course, so he expresses himself in traditional mechanical terms in describing the scenario; it's up to me to interpret that into whatever my own mechanical framework is. For me it's eminently credible for food to be subtly spoiled in the right conditions (and yes, I am willing to accept it on face value that wine might be one of the foods that could produce e.g. botulin toxins or something of the sort, rather than getting into fact-checking rut against an encyclopedia), but if a character were poisoned, I would have it proceed pretty much like food poisoning: violent illness possibly followed by death over several hours.<br/><br/>An interesting anecdote from when we were playing this: the adventurers looted the wine and sold it to the bishop's household (our campaign started in the lands of the local bishopric, so they were the temporal lord of the area as well). We had some quite fun times tracking the journey of the bottles, as I revealed to the players after the sale that there was a poisonous bottle in the lot. I tracked the bottle's journey in campaign time as it made its way through the bishop's household, which meant that for the next several sessions we would start each session with a few randomizing checks to find out where the bottle would end up. The stakes were, of course, about whether anybody important would fall ill and die from drinking that wine - could've been the bishop himself, which would certainly be tracked back to the wine-seller and therefore to the PCs. The bishop survived, I think because a lucky roll had an unfaithful servant sample the wines unauthorized a couple of weeks later, to lethal consequence.\n<blockquote>The full treasure includes 2,000 gp. According to the rules that's 100,000 sp, and therefore an equivalent amount of XP... what am I missing here?</blockquote>\nJohnstone says that the adventure is in gold standard, but I'm pretty sure that it's not. I could be misremembering, but I think that the Deluxe edition of LotFP (which this was published with) already was in silver standard.<br/><br/>However, the LotFP silver piece goes 10 to a gold piece (or that's my impression, anyway), so that's actually supposed to be 20,000 silver, and thus 20,000 xp - entirely ordinary for that sort of hoard.<br/><br/>Even if you were to read that as 100,000 rupees (my favoured term for the unit of account now that people are using different standards regularly), I wouldn't blink at that; the game functions just fine even without a meddling GM who thinks that he knows how much treasure it is good and proper for his PCs to gain from adventures. The range of appropriate numbers for treasure is actually quite wide; basically as long as it's not clearly insensible for the setting, you could have any amount of treasure in there.\n<blockquote>What's the deal with the trapdoors? Are they traps, or just vertical passages that the players can choose to go down? There's no mention that I've noticed about deep they are. One of them leads to an area with no exits. No mention is made of how the players get out, but there's also nothing about, e.g. climbing out, starving to death, which I would expect in one of the explanations for new referees, if that was the intention.</blockquote>\nA "trapdoor" is a door on the floor, not a trap. (Peculiar language, English.) You may assume their depth to be architectonically determined as whatever makes sense for a basement - so e.g. 10 feet from the lip to the bottom could work, or more if you picture the floor as particularly thick for some reason. Trapdoors in ordinary usage (in a normal house, that is) have stairs to facilitate getting up and down, but if they're not indicated (as is the case in the tower), then one might assume that the Stargazer e.g. levitates up and down, or keeps something dangerous down there and doesn't want to provide it easy access out. Adventurers may of course set up a rope ladder quite trivially to get in and out.<br/><br/>A trap like the one you're envisioning would be called a "pit trap" or "hidden pit" or something similar.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428941/#Comment_428941" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-28T15:36:43+00:00" title="February 28, 2014  3:36PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2014 3:37PM by Johnstone.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Johnstone says that the adventure is in gold standard, but I'm pretty sure that it's not.

The Deluxe edition is still on gold pieces. The text for xp is weirdly vague and just says "xp for treasure" (so it's easy to assume a silver standard given the later shift) but characters start with gp and the prices are all standard D&amp;D gold piece prices.

I don't have a copy of the Deluxe text at hand right now, either. Now that you say it, the idea of silver standard having been introduced with the Grindhouse edition sounds pretty familiar, though - there were many pretty simple things that Jim didn't institute for the Deluxe in his rush to print, that then came up for the revised edition.<br/><br/>2000 rupees sounds surprisingly small for the main stash, though. I guess it's realistic (how much money does a wizard really need at hand at any given time), but one would expect something closer to 10,000 in the main stash of a typical 1st level adventure. Then again, it's a relatively low-manpower operation to storm that tower (so you don't necessarily need to have 20 henchmen eating up treasure shares), and there's the big crystal as well. I'd probably low-ball that main stash myself as well, thinking about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428943/#Comment_428943" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-28T16:21:56+00:00" title="February 28, 2014  4:21PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dunno man, Basic D&amp;D is pretty stingy!

Personally I consider these basically the same game, because I don't see much of a game in D&amp;D unless we consider the procedures and philosophy, which are basically identical between Mentzer and Raggi. However, if you're mechanically obsessive, you'll find plenty of minor streamlining in LotFP, and if you think that flavour text and illustration are king, then that's also a way in which the games are radically different: Elmore era TSR fantasy vs. grindhouse historical horror fantasy. I certainly know many smart people, including Jim himself, who seem to think that LotFP is an entirely different and new game that just happens to have some Basic D&amp;D among its influences.<br/><br/>Regarding treasure payouts: PCs do not find and collect all treasure from a single adventure location, and henchmen take e.g. half share in most applications, including the LotFP rules. In addition, characters die (and retire, if you're into that), taking their collected xp out of the calculations. So even if one were to underwrite the prescription of 4 adventures to level up (which I don't; my own ideals on the matter are entirely different), a given adventure should still have significantly more treasure than 1/4 of leveling requires. If I had to really attempt to shoot for this progression speed goal, I'd probably assume that about 20-50% of the xp is never recovered (depends on the nature of the adventure location), and another 20-50% is lost during or soon after the adventure to character death, and a further 20% is lost to henchmen and similar expenses. In practice this means that if I want to have characters level up after e.g. 4 reasonably successful adventures, I'd rather have significantly more than 25% of the 2nd level goal in each of the four adventures. At least double that.<br/><br/>Obviously all this depends hugely on nuanced campaign practice. For example, if you only run self-contained basic dungeons, and follow reliable treasure placement guidelines, and the players are out to grind, then it's likely that they'll just vacuum the entire dungeon each time to make sure they didn't leave any treasure behind, resulting in a much higher percentage of treasure recovered. "Space-wanking", as we like to call the meticulous searching of all rooms after worst of the monster population has been reduced, in honor of <i>Doom</i> <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>In case you're writing your own adventures and are wondering about treasure placement: my own recommendation is that a single adventure intended as a solid opportunity and an endeavour worthy of a name (that is, an adventure module instead of just some piddly random encounter on the road) should provide sufficient xp to level up a 1st level party, modified by all fictional particulars of the situation. So for your typical adventure I'd put about 10,000 xp into the adventure in reasonable reach of a party that is actually achieving goals - this doesn't count all the various red herrings and incidental minor treasure, although I obviously won't necessarily put everything into one neat treasure pile at the end of a dungeon. The logic behind this prescription is that a "complete success" should more or less align with observable progress on the metaphorical bad-assitude track that is your experience level. Of course various other procedural priorities make it so that I'm breaking this parameter all the time for all sorts of reasons, and the aforementioned actual play uncertainties make it so that you almost never see a party coming out of an adventure triumphant. When you do, it's well sensible to have them level up for their success.<br/><br/>(For calibrating your expectations about the above, I should note that when I run old school D&amp;D, and when the people I've trained run it, it seems that nobody gets to 2nd level without a dozen sessions of play; setting up the paydays takes time, characters die, treasures are missed, and monsters and competing interests secure the rewards unless we're really on the ball, which all means that we adventure quite a bit without seeing a drakhma of treasure. I've personally managed to drag two characters to 2nd level over the last year of pretty regular weekly play, and one of them died the session after the achievement. As this is definitely in the more difficult end of the D&amp;D campaigning style, you might take my opinions about appropriate xp rewards with a grain of salt; if your own campaign features nice and steady achievement, with most sessions ending in at least moderate success, then it likely makes much more sense to be stingy with rewards.)<br/><br/>Of course treasure payout is a very campaign-specific scheme. Considering <i>Tower of the Stargazer</i>, I can definitely see him being simply conservative in his treasure placement there. As I said earlier, the nature of the adventure (exploration, no big fights) makes it such that it doesn't necessarily require a large party or a large lethality, so I could easily see Jim seeding the adventure intentionally to a relatively low reward standard.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JimLotFP" title="JimLotFP"><img alt="JimLotFP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JimLotFP">JimLotFP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428953/#Comment_428953" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-28T20:20:34+00:00" title="February 28, 2014  8:20PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Stargazer as written is on the gold standard; the switch to silver happened later.

TSR started having fucking boatloads of that later on: traps specifically warded against thief abilities, anti-magic zones, undead proof against turning, NPCs impossible to negotiate with and so on. To me these are signs of unhygienic thought processes invading the process of scenario design: no longer is the writer willing to have a genuine clash of wits occur over his material, for he has started to think in terms of plots and sequential events and setpiece encounters and this cool read-aloud boxed text that needs to be brought into play just so.<br/><br/>A person who thinks like that already hates the D&amp;D system, for the rules themselves are all about risk and unexpected outcomes that interfere with their clever, ever so clever storytelling; a PC might survive when they don't deserve it, or die accidentally. An easy fight might turn into a slaughter, a hard one end quickly and trivially. The scenario-writer might not account for a clever idea or extraordinary resource the adventurers bring to bear, or they might assume capacities that don't exist. The historical TSR answer to this tension was a total breakdown of the creative agenda, as writers started desiring their own story over the dynamic events of play, which was then followed by undermining the social contract with all the bullshit that we know as illusionistic traditional railroad GMing today.<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned all procedural advice in scenarios for how to rule on the various fictional situations is suggestive only, necessarily: you cannot allow some writer to take control of your game away from the group's own higher-order processes. This is a pretty radical theoretical stance, as it means that when I encounter a piece of text like "the wine is spoiled, and those drinking it have to succeed in a save vs. poison or die", the only part that I actually conside authoritative is "the wine is spoiled"; the rest is entirely a suggestion to the referee over how they might opt to resolve this situation with the poisoned wine. Unless this kind of skepticism towards module material is consistently practiced, the process of play is not safe when you utilize foreign scenario material: any idiot who wrote something stupid could manage to break your resolution processes by suggesting something stupid in their scenario material.<br/><br/>(The above counts for creature stat blocks and the nature of treasure as well, obviously; it is very compelling if a text tells me that there's a solid-gold scepter in the room, but technically speaking that number the text provides for its value is merely a suggestion that I might potentially ignore if it is in conflict with some principle of our campaign. A campaign being in the silver standard is a common example in this regard, although I personally tend to let gold items be significantly more valuable in those conditions; gold <i>is</i> valuable, after all!)<br/><br/>All this means that when an adventure text tries to hedge, I'm almost likelier to go the exact opposite way out of spite <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> One of the best turns of events in our campaign ever happened around the 12th session in the <i>Temple of the Ghoul</i> (a very good adventure apart from this one bit, that one; few realize its virtues, I should probably write some sort of use advice for it), where the text tries to hedge a treasure: a large treasure trove is described, but then the writer refuses to name a value for it, and instead suggests that characters who consider taking this treasure should suffer alignment loss and basically be kicked out of the campaign for being assholes - and all this for no good reason, basically just religious scruples because the treasure presumably belongs to a "good" cult. I obviously threw out this blatant attempt at dictating outcomes, and instead allowed the players to brave a divine curse if they desired to finally, after massive effort, to reach 2nd level - there was more than enough treasure for everybody to level who dared to <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>As far as the Stargazer spoiled wine goes, I don't remember any hedging text - it's just a straightforward cause -&gt; effect description. I personally would allow for the possibility that a character could notice the spoilage, even as I'd assume that it's a subtle sort of effect difficult to detect. Of course, the old D&amp;D saving throw system already encompasses the chance that a character would notice the taste to be off (saving throws do not dictate why a character is saved, so it's usually considered a formalistic mechanic: we know that he was saved, so just make something up to fit the situation), so this wouldn't actually change the LotFP procedure unless a player specifically declared that they're observing the taste carefully for spoilage.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden" title="MartinEden"><img alt="MartinEden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/728/nG1YHA4QTUL1O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden">MartinEden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429013/#Comment_429013" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-02T11:23:05+00:00" title="March  2, 2014 11:23AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi, I was away for the weekend, so there's a lot for me to respond to here.

I just wanted to be sure this wasn't a trap.\n<h4>The treasure</h4>\n<blockquote>Even if you were to read that as 100,000 rupees... I wouldn't blink at that; the game functions just fine even without a meddling GM who thinks that he knows how much treasure it is good and proper for his PCs to gain from adventures.</blockquote>\nI personally agree with the philosophy of running these things as written, and not imposing some "balance" to stop the players getting "too much" XP. But I was really surprised, even so, at the idea that this first level dungeon would give enough XP to ~6 characters up to 5th level in one go. At that point... why even have those other levels? Hence me suspecting I was getting it wrong. Also, as far as I can tell from the free version of LotFP rules, yes, it is 50 sp to 1 gp. See "Determine starting possessions".<br/><br/>But anyway, it seems like I should read this as 1 GP = 1 XP. Thanks for clearing that up.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429015/#Comment_429015" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-02T11:54:48+00:00" title="March  2, 2014 11:54AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, you should remember the rule about xp limits! You can only ever gain a maximum of one level for each adventure. Says so in the AD&amp;D DMG, and pretty much every other D&amp;D text since then. A very important rule for the game's balance when you're not fudging to ensure that the players don't get too much money. It's a natural part of the game that there are occasionally jackpots, and you are absolutely correct that they'd skew the game's math horribly if they were allowed to stand without adjustment. The "one level from each adventure" rule is an elegant cap for these situations, ensuring that a character of level N has indeed encountered at least N entirely different adventure arcs.<br/><br/>When I refereed Tower of the Stargazer for the first time, the rest of the party died against the wizard while a single Halfling stole away with the crystal. He maxed out the xp limit with that single treasure; he only gained enough xp from it to take him to the cap, and the rest was lost. These sorts of things happen. In my experience I'd say that about 3% of game sessions seem to involve such off-scale treasures or other xp sources that the xp gain cap comes into play.<br/><br/>The traditional rule is pretty funky in its details, as it says that characters can only gain xp at most up to one point less than the requirement would be for the level following the next one they're gaining. So a 1st level character could gain up to one point less than 3rd level requires. As might be expected, I've simplified this at my own table in my strive for elegance by saying that characters can at most double their xp from one source, and no more (but that this limit only comes into force starting at 2nd level for understandable reasons). Mine is a considerably tighter limit (the cap is about a quarter of the traditional cap at worst), but it's conceptualized a little differently (per source instead of per adventure), and the nature of these situations is such that everybody usually has better things to worry about than whether the character gets an insane amount of xp, or merely a stupendous amount.<br/><br/>You're right about the silver/gold conversion rate, I just checked. I'm clearly remembering some other text there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden" title="MartinEden"><img alt="MartinEden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/728/nG1YHA4QTUL1O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden">MartinEden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429017/#Comment_429017" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-02T12:07:51+00:00" title="March  2, 2014 12:07PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Having written the rest of this post by now, I first of all want to say that I'm generally much happier with the module just having had some time for it to sink in. It was so different from anything I've run before that reading it was like continually being slapped in the face with surprises. After the weekend, and your help, it feels like it makes a lot more sense to me. I'm pretty sold even on the ghost and the wine bottle. It would still be nice to have the general guidance on what are the principles at work in reading modules like this for the future, so there are some questions below.\n<h4>The wine bottle &amp; the ghost</h4>...about half of the reasons for using an adventure module boil down to not having to do your own prep, which enables you to improvise more naturally. You'll ruin that if your attitude towards an adventure module is to carefully, ever so carefully study it and forensically nit-pick it to death in advance.<br/>Yes. I wouldn't normally go into this much detail. However, I am considering running a number of modules soon. Having never done so before, I wanted first to learn how to read them. So I went through and occasionally went "huh, that seems odd" or "I don't know if I like that." I wanted to test my understanding of the relationship I'm meant to have with the module - are those legitimate reactions to have to the content? When I run it, would I come up with alternatives to the things I don't like? Is that wrong, and I should suppress those reactions in favour of fresh input into my refereeing from the text? Or is there something wrong with my understanding of good play that is making me have those reactions, that I might be able to fix for the future? Hence bringing my negative reactions to this forum. With that context, I'd like to pursue the matters of the ghost and the wine bottle further.\n<blockquote>The <i>wine bottle</i> is unfair? What about the handle of the front door?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>I could be wrong about your thought process here, but to me it reads like your primary issue with this wine bottle is that it causes a poison save vs. death, and death's too harsh.</blockquote>\nThis isn't my issue here - I'm totally okay with save vs. instant death, although I am considering implementing Eero's critical hits mechanic. I have no issue with the front door, the magic mirror, the poison needle trap, let alone the traps that are more elaborate to trigger - the telescope, the wizard, etc. My issue here is more of internal fictional consistency. Which I think Eero understood:\n<blockquote>You're seriously overthinking the issue. The problem with doing that is that you're actually reducing realism and adventurability of the adventure if you insist that everything in this module you're running has to conform to your preconceptions. You are not that wizard, you are not the ghost, you are not James Raggi. You are merely presenting the facts as they lay on the ground.<br/>...Everything I said about the ghost applies here; as far as I'm considered you're just being a bore if you insist that it's impossible for a difficult-to-detect poisonous spoilage to be present in a wine stock. What's next, are you going to remove the lightning trap because electricity doesn't work that way, too?</blockquote>\nI get that. The reason I am using the module is to have adventures I never would have come up with, given my sensibilities - and skills! But I want the situation the characters are in to be plausible, given the established particulars, whether the punishment is minor or major. That doesn't mean the PCs always have a chance of predicting it (although smart play would <i>usually</i> reward you) as sometimes the situation may be fictionally plausible but completely unknown to the players - like, this frog they kill was actually the avatar of a god and now it's angry with them. Now I agree a wizard's tower is fairly far along the "bizarre and unexpected" spectrum - anyone going and looking in the weird mirrors deserves what they get! I'm cool with the module author expanding my conception of plausibility. Some of the other challenges surprised me and I thought, "But yeah, that's a interesting idea I wouldn't have thought of." But with the wine and the ghost I had issues.<br/><br/>The ghost, because no reason is given, and it didn't seem obvious to me from the text such that no reason was necessary. I'm okay with the designer teaching me the new thing, but here no explanation is given. Now, it happens that I like quite a few of the explanations Eero gave for the ghost's presence. But at the time I was reading it through I didn't know whether it was because I hadn't given it enough thought, or because the module designer had left me with a challenge that just didn't make any sense. Do I want to run something where I am nervous that it's just an artificial meta-game thing, imposed onto the fiction? Obviously you can eventually make anything fit, so long as you are willing to alter your setting enough, but as more of the setting is established through play that gets harder. So next time I read a module and the designer has left no explanation for the presence of a challenge, and I can't think of one on my first read through, what should I do? Run it blindly and hope that it works out? Spend some time trying to come up with something?<br/><br/>With the wine, the issue is different. He gives an explanation, but even being open-minded it just seems odd to me - if wine can become deadly in a undetectable way when left for too long - well, the PCs should know that right? That should be a standard hazard of drinking wine in this world. You'd check the "best before" date real careful. Now, I'm happier with the explanation that Jim gives above, about specifically the wine decaying "in a magical environment". At which point, you may say, if that's all the hand-waving you need, Martin, why all this fuss? It's because I'm trying to establish the correct way of reading these texts more generally. Is the correct thing for me to do change the explanation when I disagree with the designer? I could have come up with that hand-wave myself, but I wasn't sure I had the authority to do so. Eero seems to suggest that I should feel free to handle spoiled wine in whatever makes sense for my game: "the only part that I actually conside authoritative is "the wine is spoiled"; the rest is entirely a suggestion to the referee over how they might opt to resolve this situation with the poisoned wine." At which point, I would drop the module's "however, in no circumstances should the poisoned bottle be described any differently from the others unless someone actually drinks from it" - the undetectable clause, which made me so unhappy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden" title="MartinEden"><img alt="MartinEden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/728/nG1YHA4QTUL1O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden">MartinEden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429018/#Comment_429018" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-02T12:12:32+00:00" title="March  2, 2014 12:12PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 2, 2014 12:12PM by MartinEden.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Ah, you should remember the rule about xp limits!

There's definitely a strong thread of random horror-movie killing running through Raggi's work, where somebody has to die in order for the players to understand a thing. There's a cliff in the Monolith from Beyond Time and Space that pretty much has to kill someone before the players can figure it out, and there's a really annoying segment in Death Love Doom that basically explains the Bad Thing of the module is going to fuck up the queen no matter what the PCs do (no matter what spells they use, or methods, or what have you).<br/><br/>These are admonitions that you can safely ignore. I do. You're right to think the undetectability of the poison is a different issue -- it's a negative feature of the setting, as opposed to a positive feature. It tells you what can't happen. Personally, and maybe this is because my D&amp;D experience is a mash-up of so much different shit, I prefer only to know how and on what principles a thing works and what it does. A simple "you can't do this or that" because of a thing doesn't explain anything to me. If a thing stops PCs from doing something by a process, that's cool -- you can't see because the orb creates darkness; you can't hear because the sword devours sound. That means you have principles with which to judge how it interacts with that magic item from the AD&amp;D module you ran six months ago when used in conjunction with that spell from Carcosa the PCs found, against a monster you got off somebody's blog.<br/><br/>But old D&amp;D modules and setting supplements have a lot of it, where certain spells don't work in certain places, often because they circumvent puzzles the author wants players to solve. But if it ever says you can't do something in a module without explaining what the process is, I just ignore it. Actually, if it explains the process, I keep that part and ignore the part about how a thing can't happen under any circumstances.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429027">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429027/#Comment_429027" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-02T19:32:59+00:00" title="March  2, 2014  7:32PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's an interesting point about the admonishment about the undetectability of the poison. I read it as Jim stepping outside the purview of scenario spec and into pedagogical space: he wrote that adventure with referee indoctrination in mind, which is why it has an unusual amount of value-based hedging. Him telling you that the wine's spoilage is undetectable is him trying to get you to let the dice fall where they may so that the conceived danger has a proper chance to occur; he's concerned that the conceit falls flat if the ref makes the obvious interpretation (that the spoilage would be obvious to any consumer before it'd be dangerous). I would read that as a suggestion as to Jim's own preferences, but exactly as Johnstone says, it's at most suggestive: if he doesn't give you causal reasons for why this particular corridor is anti-magical and the trap in it auto-hits any paladin who steps foot in it, I at least would either think up some likely reason myself, or ignore that part because it's not legitimate in my eyes. Of course regarding the wine bottle I happen to side with Jim's conceit: it's a valid conceit that under this dungeonesque sun there might occur an undetectably dangerous bottle of wizard's wine, and that has nothing to do with normal processes of spoilage and everything to do with adventurers potentially getting into trouble for trusting their senses too much when it comes to eldritch locations and foodstuffs procured from such.<br/><br/>That's not to say that I always agree with the module author, or specifically with Jim - he has a habit for pushing the envelope, seeing what kinds of idiocy he might get other people to run; I'm not even that certain if he's serious about it all the time. I'm used to routinely ignoring the most atrocious brain-farts that aren't compatible with my own procedural paradigm. It's a bit like how I routinely swap the boring AD&amp;D magic items in <i>Expeditious Retreat Press</i> adventures for more interesting and setting-consistent ones; all part of adapting the scenario to my campaign.<br/><br/>I guess if had to give a heuristic for interpreting adventure module hazards, based on this discussion, I'd craft something like this: as the GM is responsible for representing a consistent setting according to local standards, he has to be able to stand behind the conceits he proffers for the players. At the same time, it is good of him to stretch himself and attempt constructive reading of material, for without such it is impossible to actually run material not written by yourself. Thus a necessary compromise emerges when every element of the proposed adventure is put under the judgement of the GM, who determines case-by-case whether that conceit is legitimate according to the local standards. The legitimate material the GM implicitly backs by introducing it into play, while the unfitting, foolish things that he doesn't understand or appreciate, those he changes to fit. The "constructive" part of the process is that where given a choice, the GM opts to read things in a way that makes sense to him instead of a way where they don't work. In this way he actually achieves a functional adventure instead of having to conclude that all too many adventure modules are impossible to use because of how they differ from his own unique expectations in subtle ways.<br/><br/>The reason for why I'm so vague with that description of the adventure-adaptation process is that I don't really believe that things like e.g. realistic causality are universal and universally necessary parts of the game - it depends on the local playstyle and standards as to how far one finds it necessary to go in that regard. Everybody in this discussion seems to price things making sense, but there are also people out there who judge under different criteria that I might term "extreme constructivism": whatever has been written in the adventure spec is how things are, and how things are never require any explanations or causes to occur. This is generally the "wizard did it" school of adventure conceptualization <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Also, Martin: I find your approach to reading the text entirely commendable. I hope you didn't take my earlier didactic musings in an aggressive tone, I was just carried away in singing the praises of constructive reading attitudes. Of course if you can't stand behind a conceit such as that subtly poisonous wizard wine, then that's ultimatley between you and your setting vision. I guess that my real point in the main was simply that the use of module adventures necessarily implies a pretty liberal setting vision, one where it's better to lean back from minor details and attempt to make them work rather than condemning them on flimsy grounds.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JimLotFP" title="JimLotFP"><img alt="JimLotFP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JimLotFP">JimLotFP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429031/#Comment_429031" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-02T22:37:43+00:00" title="March  2, 2014 10:37PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &gt;&gt;and there's a really annoying segment in Death Love Doom that basically explains the Bad Thing of the module is going to fuck up the queen no matter what the PCs do (no matter what spells they use, or methods, or what have you).<br/><br/>Not true - if you retrieve the necklace and then keep it safe, nothing's going to happen.

(and if the PCs just sit around and let other people take care of the problems of the Bloodworth Estate, they don't have much grounds to complain when that creates more problems.)<br/><br/>Granted, the adventure as written doesn't give much of a clue what's going on, but that's sort of the point. It's only when the necklace causes trouble the second time somewhere else that the PCs might get a clue and realize that extra steps should be taken.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429032/#Comment_429032" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-02T23:53:14+00:00" title="March  2, 2014 11:53PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, the part where you say what will happen if it gets out is fine.

It is useful to realize that we face the same questions in this special case as we do in the most fundamental acts in setting up the game. Consider:<br/><br/>If your game were a perfectly robust simulation, there would be no room for either challenges or gameability to exist: no character could be a player character, for they would each already have their perfectly imposed motivations and nature, with no room for deviation from determined process of resolution. It would be NPCs vs. NPCs, forever. Players could operate the Sims Adventure scenario, but they could not play with it, or be challenged by it. Win or loss, it is the perfectly justified outcome of logical process.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if gameability is the only concern, then we are fighting each other: anything ever established in the SIS is a tool of maneuver in achieving victory against the other players; rules lawyering proliferates and all concerns are focused on technical means of conquest. No appreciation is left for the matter of whether your solutions - your very play - are legitimate in the sense of communicating a true thing about fictional tactics and strategy. Victory becomes nothing but bullying and sophistry.<br/><br/>Because I find neither of those extremes agreeable, I handle introducing new PCs as a balancing act: generally players have a subjective right to play for gameability reasons, which means that they can get a new character into play without too much hassle; we willingly stretch the simulation and assume a new character to be possible here and now. The player is not forced to wait for some extremely narrow simulation gap where it would be perfectly realistic for a new character to appear, and they are not expected to run through a rigamarole maneuver with the other PCs to prove that they have legit social positioning for joining the party. Either of those requirements would be punitive from a gameability viewpoint, we could not play at all if we required such a degree of realism consistently: if new PCs can't be introduced, why can adventurers find adventures to begin with, that's an even more unrealistic supposition.<br/><br/>However: when a scenario is on-going, challenges have been identified and the pieces are moving, I might limit, forbid or delay bringing in new PCs. The key issue is whether the new character ruins the fundamental challenge of the scenario. An entrapment scenario is a good example: if you only have four friends with you in a gauntlet to the death, and you're dropping one by one, growing weaker by the moment, it makes no sense whatsoever for new PCs to keep popping up to bolster the ranks in the middle of the challenge. It ruins the scenario.<br/><br/>In real play "you'll get to come back for the next scenario with a new character" is a rare event because it is rare that there would be no role for a player to play in a scenario. Typically the party is in a relatively lax dungeon crawl where it doesn't matter tactically whether "the party had one more member all along", for example. If the situation is slightly more tense (e.g. we know that a goblin war-party is waiting for their moment to strike), the party might have to retreat from the dungeon, rendezvous with a friend who was left to guard the camp, and then go back into the dungeon. Or the player might take over a NPC retainer, if such are still left.<br/><br/>Last night we had a character die in our face-to-face game. Peitsa just took one of the retainers for his new character. Not a big deal despite the party being stuck on the 2nd level of the megadungeon at the time, as we had about half a dozen retainers with us at that point.<br/><br/>When a scenario is under tactical tension (so the party can't just get reinforcements) and the social impact on gameability is severe (the night is young and the player keen to play more), we shuffle through a variety of compromise possibilities that best balance gameability with scenario consistency. Here more exotic solutions like "we force our captive to guide us, you can play him" or "the goblins have a PC race prisoner in a cage" come in. The more gameability pressure there is, the more drastic assumptions the GM makes to make room for a new character. I have been known to use "OK, let's do single-roll resolution for the rest of this entire scenario, as it's not that interesting and half of the players are already out".<br/><br/>Ultimately, though, I am of the mind that asking for a new character mid-scenario is somewhat similar to asking to start a new business in Monopoly when you've gone bankrupt. We allow it because the game is cooperative and thus to a degree the scenario's not an utter failure when one player has been played out, but it is not an absolute subjective right you have. A good player realizes when adding a new character would have a major impact on the established challenge, and won't mind to wait for the others to resolve the outstanding situation before again joining play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431602/#Comment_431602" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-25T12:03:24+00:00" title="April 25, 2014 12:03PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great answers!<br/><br/>I'm a huge fan of the 'take over an existing NPC' method, personally, because it retains plausibility and makes for some potentially very rich fictional scenarios.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431608/#Comment_431608" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-25T12:43:44+00:00" title="April 25, 2014 12:43PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>On the other hand, if gameability is the only concern, then we are fighting each other: anything ever established in the SIS is a tool of maneuver in achieving victory against the other players; rules lawyering proliferates and all concerns are focused on technical means of conquest.

So, it transpires that what you're calling "gameability" is my main concern as Dungeon Master. This leads me to feel a little uncomfortable about your description of how that leads me into combat with my Players or to PvP situations. In the defence of Gameability its end-point isn't adding this absurd PvP/PvDM victory scenario for no reason. The Game qua Game is about undertaking challenging adventures together with DM as referee and the position of the (ideal) player in the text is one of enlightened self-interest in regards to experiencing adventures collaboratively but not for "conquest" over others present at the table. This game-as-conquest model is psychotic and nothing I've ever seen in reality (although perhaps a few shaky moments of social tension here and there). <br/><br/>There's a much more sensible mode of Gameability where we accept that everyone present has come to play a game and thus there's no social reason for the DM to block the immediate introduction of the player back into the game as a new character after PC death. It's more important to me that everyone who wants to play can play (and speak and move and liberally express themselves) any time they like: it's uncomfortable for me to block a player's desire to play a character <i>now</i> simply because it wouldn't be <i>realistic</i> in a fantasy game. A lot of the time players are willing to hold off, catch their breath and wait for a good time to rejoin the adventure out of <i>their own</i> interest in reasonable verisimilitude (or realism, or whatever) or desire to uphold challenging play - not the one <i>I want</i> to impose on them as DM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jacob" title="Jacob"><img alt="Jacob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jacob">Jacob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431614/#Comment_431614" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-25T14:01:42+00:00" title="April 25, 2014  2:01PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>But I have more issues with the ghost: why is he even there?

Any suggestions as to what to replace him with?</blockquote>\nMy rationale (if I was running the game) would be that the ghost plays the chess game like a computer; same responses to moves every time. All the wizard has to do is memorize a quick 5 moves to win strategy and use that every time.<br/><br/>Why didn't the wizard just use a pass-phase? Why did he use such a needlessly complicated and easily circumvented security system? He's a wizard, dude. In LOTFP terms he's Chaotic by definition.<br/><br/>Or if I was feeling particularity vicious the whole chess game is a smokescreen, to get past the ghost all you REALLY have to do is move your knight to a specific illegal square. If you sit down and ACTUALLY play the game (like a fool) it triggers a trap whether you win or not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/adamwb" title="adamwb"><img alt="adamwb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/adamwb">adamwb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431632/#Comment_431632" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-25T20:59:22+00:00" title="April 25, 2014  8:59PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 25, 2014 8:59PM by adamwb.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>A lot of the time players are willing to hold off, catch their breath and wait for a good time to rejoin the adventure out of <i>their own</i> interest in reasonable verisimilitude (or realism, or whatever) or desire to uphold challenging play - not the one <i>I want</i> to impose on them as DM.</blockquote>\nI used to worry about this before I got comfortable with reading the players, yes.

I gave them a number of rumours that I had populated my sandbox world with, and they did indeed decide to go investigate the strange red lightning on the Barogan Moors - which was, of course, The Tower of the Stargazer.<br/><br/>Early days yet, as we spent the beginning of the session explaining rules, rolling up characters, and then moved on to the logistics phase of discussing the rumours they had heard - was lovely to see them doing the classic D&amp;D task of trying to decide what risks were worth taking for which rewards based on very limited info. Then we had overland hex-crawling of the moors to the base of the tower, so we only had about an hour of real life time in the tower proper. During which time they haven't got on to the really fantastical parts of the tower yet - they've explored the rooms leading up to the bleeding door thoroughly and decided not to go into the trapdoors in case someone piles the statue on top and they can't escape.<br/><br/>The session ended with them bashing in the bleeding door. This, of course, resulted in a tidal wave of blood, which very nearly killed the party caller but, due to me using a version of Eero's critical hits, merely left him disfigured from a bone-crunching collision with the stone floor - 17 Charisma halved to 8! Quick thinking (and a high save) on the part of the lantern bearer at the top of the steps allowed her to throw the lantern down, where another very good save allowed someone else to catch it.<br/><br/>So I haven't needed player death rules yet, but they've barely encountered any of the dangers of the tower. Next time...<br/><br/>We had a good time, as far as I can tell from my position as GM and from asking people afterwards.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden" title="MartinEden"><img alt="MartinEden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/728/nG1YHA4QTUL1O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden">MartinEden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432410/#Comment_432410" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-11T13:43:44+00:00" title="May 11, 2014  1:43PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We played our second session today, carrying on from where we last left off. Two players couldn't make it (leaving us with 4), including the injured one. So he and a friend were hand-waved as having retreated to nurse his wounds, whilst the remaining four entered the wizard's chamber. And here ended our exploration of the wizard's tower, sadly, as after a bit of talking, the fighter decided to attack the wizard, releasing him from imprisonment.<br/><br/>The wizard proceeded to reduce the whole party to negative hitpoints with a 13d4 magic missile, killing two of the characters. The other two fled down the stairs (more or less falling down them in their wounded state) and escaped, as a random roll revealed that the wizard wasn't disposed to chase them beyond his tower. However, one of the players then changed his mind and asked if he could have snaffled the expensive china on the way out. I said, sure, but it would mean another roll to see if the wizard catches up with him. He went for it and was killed. A classic example of player greed.<br/><br/>There was a definite moment of wanting to go soft on them. Particularly because I really wanted them to get to enjoy more of the adventure. But I went for it, and I feel like I have proved my OSR referee chops by instead gleefully playing a sadistic wizard and slaughtering the party. One badly wounded fighter escaped, who it has been established has probably retired to drink in taverns and mutter dire warnings to future adventurers.<br/><br/>Of course, now the twisted wizard is free from his bondage to wreak havoc on our sandbox world...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432414/#Comment_432414" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-11T16:00:59+00:00" title="May 11, 2014  4:00PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, very nice.

Basically, the GM wouldn't have put me in this situation if I weren't supposed to be doing this thing I'm just now doing. Makes for rude surprises on occasion.)<br/><br/>How did the players take the sudden reversal? People tend to have all sorts of reactions to a sudden party kill like that. A lot has to do with how they understand the events in context (e.g. whether they view the GM as responsible, and whether they parse the outcome as a failure of play), and people also have their fundamental preferences about what they want to have in a rpg. D&amp;D is all about creative destruction, which isn't for everybody.<br/><br/>If you're continuing the campaign, the Stargazer certainly makes for a fine sandbox NPC. He's not necessarily evil as such, merely a mighty and amoral wizard. Could be a source of advice, a target to case for a robbery (good luck with that, now the wizard's free), a source of trouble when some wizard thing of his runs wild, or even a mentor or a source for new adventures.

When pitching the campaign to my group, I have been at pains to describe how this is different from the D&amp;D we have played before. They have been fully expecting their first X characters to die quickly (or at least claiming that they do). I also made it clear how the game didn't balance things - that there were real things at stake on their decisions.<br/><br/>The other three were very keen for him not to attack the wizard, but there is, alas, not much time to stop someone with their finger on the crossbow trigger. As far as I can tell, the player who attacked the wizard was half expecting this to happen - I parse the experience as: He knew intellectually what I had been saying about the game, but wanted to test it and really see if I meant it.\n<blockquote>If you're continuing the campaign, the Stargazer certainly makes for a fine sandbox NPC</blockquote>\nIndeed, I have some ideas along these lines. I'm going to write a random table, I think, which allows me to be a bit less ends-motivated, and also to share with any other GMs who end up with this situation.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden" title="MartinEden"><img alt="MartinEden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/728/nG1YHA4QTUL1O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden">MartinEden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432496/#Comment_432496" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-13T02:49:23+00:00" title="May 13, 2014  2:49AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've begun work on this, and so far I have come up with some rules/ideas for Calcidius attempting to get revenge through cursing the party.

So yes, he does have better things to do with his time - his long term obsessions with his research. But I could also see that if he did decide to nurse a grudge he'd be pretty dogged about it. Hence the 50/50 chance to see if he does decide to fixate on the survivors. But hey, this is just my conception of his character - GMs can pick and choose from these ideas. <br/><br/>Perhaps I should put in something about the possibility of the wizard giving up after a while, rather than making it unending? I just kind of assumed that an arrogant wizard like him, if somehow the PCs did manage to resist his curses for, say, eight weeks that would just infuriate him more, rather than making him give up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432512/#Comment_432512" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-13T06:38:23+00:00" title="May 13, 2014  6:38AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bold strokes in characterization are good for quick and powerful positioning work. Nuance and realism are good for long-term work that backgrounds those bold strokes. For this reason we want to make simple and gameable short-term tactical decisions ("Today this NPC is ill-tempered.") when within scenarios, but always keep the option of grounding those decisions later ("He is passionate, but strives towards discipline; however, he happened to have a bad day.").<br/><br/>Thus, Cacidius in a tactical situation and Calcidius in long-term strategic play might be somewhat different considerations. I'm not saying that he cannot be a cartoonish villain, but perhaps a hypothetical scenario helps explain why it might be a good idea to keep every door open for further revision and deeper understanding: say that the PCs dodge his revenge for eight weeks, and then one of the brighter bulbs decides to go meet with the man and apologize for barging in on him like that earlier. Say they'll bring a rare jade statue with them, one that they imagine the wizard would like. So the players are taking a risk off the assumption that the NPC is a human with human psychology, and we're going to reward them with a cartoon villain obsessed with revenge? Sure, it could happen - but if it's going to happen with procedural certainty, then the players should have been made aware of it in advance - they should know that this in this campaign that kind of stratagem will always fail.<br/><br/>All of the above is not intended to directly comment upon Martin's approach (I haven't even looked at his table yet), it's just to illustrate the questions involved in running important NPCs long-term. I personally generally opt for "infinite nuancing" in the sense that I don't consciously simplify long-term strategic elements such as what a NPC might or might not want or do. (This is a big part in why I don't usually randomize strategic choices, either - randomization loses GM vision and nuance.)<br/><br/>The way I handle long-term nemesises and rivals like the wizard here, myself, might be of interest: I handle them as special random encounters that might come up later in the ordinary random encounter processes. Once they do, I retroactively figure out what they're about now. So the wizard might come up again a short time later, or a long time later, and I'd decide whether they're out for revenge or it's a change encounter or whatever at that time, rather than having a premapped table of possibilities. I might roll a few dice rolls to make any close calls, but primarily I'd rely on my intuitive understanding of who and what the NPC is - that is, I attempt to foster that deep organic nuance in their depiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432556">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432556/#Comment_432556" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-13T14:52:04+00:00" title="May 13, 2014  2:52PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>What would working the wizard into ordinary random encounter processes look like, in practice?

I've just said that the cursing continues either until all the survivor's are cursed, or until the situation is resolved somehow. I include in my list of example resolutions appeasement of Calcidius by the party.<br/><br/>So I am not leaving the wizard's behaviour up to chance. My understanding of his nature is that once he has begun his project of cursing the survivors he's not going to give up after a few tries just because it turns out the PCs resisted his first few attempts - he's going to obsessively keep going until either he gets what he wants, or something changes his mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
