I was always saddened by the differences in how White Wolf suggested that Changeling should play and how the rules actually made the game play. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that Changeling will work much better if it adopted the Solar System.  I couldn't find something like this anywhere, so I've begun work on this for a chronicle I'm planning on running in a month or so.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas this been done before?  Is there a link that someone could send that would save me the hours and hours of work?  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf not, I am beginning this quest today.  In the open and free spirit of TSoY, the crunch will all be posted on my web site, here:  http://toasty-fish.com/<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently, there's a bunch of TSoY crunch on there, adventure logs from past TSoY games we've run (they're Eero-approved), a 4th Ed D&amp;D drinking game / adventure I wrote for my friend's bachelor party, and D&amp;D adventure logs (none of which is approved by WotC).<br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts, discussions, critiques, URLs, etc., would be appreciated (as always).<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nJohn                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375055/#Comment_375055" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T07:07:30+00:00" title="April 30, 2012  7:07AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John,<br/><br/>I did something similar with Vampire: the Masquerade some years back, although I don't have anything online I could point you toward.

Reading the logs, it gives off a strong underground fantasy wibe not dissimilar to how I play the game myself.<br/><br/>And yes, people have tried out Solar System / Whitewolf mashups relatively often, but I don't think I've seen Changeling yet. My general impression is that the results have been fair to mediocre; I'm not entirely certain why this is, but I suspect that it's because the sort of person who tries this usually has very vivid, emotionally charged images of how Vampire/Werewolf/Exalted should <i>be</i> in terms of color and plot structures and so on. This creative priority can conflict with the Solar System, which I personally think works best with wild abandon and strong methodical respect for the system, a willingness to go where the dice and your aesthetics lead you. When you find that your mechanically elegant crunch landscape totally leads to vampire domination over the werewolf population, you should be able to laugh at it and say "Well well, who knew?" If you feel like something failed in that situation, or even if you foresee it and dodge to the side (fudge, stop play, whatever), then Solar System is probably not the right thing to use there. It's a system that <i>will</i> ruin your setting, basically.<br/><br/>Regardless, I personally feel that Solar System is a great match-up to a Whitewolf setting, as the setting offers a lot of color and cultural detail and there's even a lot of crunch to adapt - no lack of ideas there. I don't know Changeling well enough myself to suggest a specific approach, but in general I find that I do my best Solar System work top-down: choose a basic sketch of which things in the fiction should have contact points in the system, which points should be primary (is there e.g. a set of Abilities that are powered up by Secrets, or a set of Secrets that are used with arbitrary Abilities, or just large Pool expenditures, or what), and then just draw out the minor details on the basis of this framework. For example, in Changeling I might go with the idea that a character's Fairy fuel (whatever it was called, I forget) is a single Pool, which will then have mechanical implications on how it works; I would ride these implications and build on top of them instead of getting frustrated because things don't work exactly like they do in the original system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20H" title="John H"><img alt="John H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20H">John H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375074/#Comment_375074" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T08:11:58+00:00" title="April 30, 2012  8:11AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2012 8:12AM by John H.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mendel, that would be great, I'd love to read your thoughts!  <br/>\n<br/>\nEero, I'm 100% with you on the "Solar System will screw up your setting" comment... I think Changeling:  The Dreaming would benefit from a system that allowed its players to go crazy.  It is, after all, a game wherein the forces of creativity are at war with banality.  It's a setting that cries out for its players to make the setting more magical and weird than it was at the start.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn my initial writeup, I was going to put Glamour (the Fairy fuel) as a Pool and have all the Arts (fairy magic) be Abilities that use Glamour.

I would myself consider reducing the "mundane" Pools into just one or two to reduce focus on the mundane at the expense of the supernatural. A lot depends on whether you're envisioning mortal people as subjects or objects of play (a very explosive issue of Whitewolf games in general, few games are as thematically disdainful of ordinary people); if they're supposed to be basically furniture, then it doesn't make sense to waste too much time and attention on them. Also, one might ask whether matters of flesh are a genuine venue of conflict in Changeling in the first place: if somebody is strong and muscular, does this truly matter, or is it more important what they are within? Pools generally should involve genuine arenas of conflict - they're things where a player can really stand and claim kudos for his character on the basis of him being so strong, clever, or whatever.<br/><br/>I don't quite remember what the Changeling cosmology thinks of human nature, but I'd basically follow whatever it says on this. (The original system is less apt as a guideline, as it's so generic in how it models mundane characters.) Do humans have souls, or are they merely potentially glamorous? Is flesh real, or is it a distraction from the true reality? I could see doing mortals with just one Pool, "Flesh", if the cosmology considers mundane humans spiritually dead like e.g. Harry Potter does. Or two Pools, "Flesh" and "Spirit" if they're dualistic creatures. Or just one, "Spirit", if that's what everything amounts to ultimately. Maybe faerie creatures get "Glamour" and humans get "Spirit", and these are partially interchangeable (mostly same Ability associations, etc.) but then not really in anything truly important. The titular changelings could get both Pools, and part of play is how you trade them in and perhaps ultimately relinquish one altogether in favour of the other.<br/><br/>Of course, having one eye on Pool refreshment scenes helps in picking how many Pools you want. (More Pools is more refreshment, at least a bit.) The central Changeling conceit of faeries leeching their glamour from human inspiration and inspiring them in turn seems like an obvious refreshment scene for the Glamour Pool. Worthwhile to consider what other types of refreshment there might be in the Changeling world.<br/><br/>A sufficiently distanced urban fantasy might even judge ordinary mortals as unworthy of being actors in the setting at all. In this case I wouldn't need to worry about contrasting a fae's character build with a mortal's at all, as I could do all mortals as conditional penalties, tools and environmental challenges. For a radical treatment of this systemic possibility see the <a href="solarwiki.janus-design.it/en/book/4th-movement-species-near#one-eyed-memories" rel="nofollow">World of Near on "one-eyes"</a>. The implications are pretty neat in that e.g. the player character changeling would never need to make more than a simple Ability check to overcome a purely mundane source of resistance. Banality-bolstered mundanes could be treated as Effects.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John H</cite>I'd add Banality as an Ability that mortals could use to resolve conflicts against the changelings.</blockquote>\nInteresting twist to not have it be a Pool. People have often said that Changeling is very vague about what is "banal", so it certainly helps if you just limit it to a single Ability instead of having an entire Pool that reigns over Abilities like Accounting and Computer-use <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>Banality is probably a Passive Ability associated with whatever Pool it is that reigns over the material concerns of humanity. I sort of like the idea that there is a "Material" or "Flesh" Pool, and instead of having the character be defended in that area by the ordinary adventure fiction Abilities like being Vigorous or whatever, he's kept intact by his robust base nature - that is, his banality, his unwillingness to change. Makes Banality sort of a mixed thing; who is to say that it's not a <i>good</i> thing to be a certain, controlled, ordered thing. Probably the Ability's not even called "banality" by anybody except the fae folk, who are naturally on a pretty extreme political and philosophical edge on this entire matter of human nature.<br/><br/>Note that making Banality a Passive Ability means that it'd be naturally used to resist faerie magic, but using it actively would mostly come up as a support: pick a real Ability you're using against the fae, and boost it up with Banality. This suits me fine, most people probably wouldn't be so magical as to just concentrate hard on making the faeries go away.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20H" title="John H"><img alt="John H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20H">John H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375152/#Comment_375152" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T12:12:29+00:00" title="April 30, 2012 12:12PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2012 12:12PM by John H.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm going to break my response into multiple posts because this one is getting long.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">I would myself consider reducing the "mundane" Pools into just one or two to reduce focus on the mundane at the expense of the supernatural...

I don't think it would be fair to the mortals to reduce them to simple Flesh.  They did, after all, create The Dreaming and they fairies with their imaginations and dreams and such.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdditionally, I think we have interesting and meaningful avenues of conflict in all three areas...<br/>\n<br/>\nBody:  Goons physically try to throw a Changeling into the back of a van in a crowded city street.  The Changeling probably couldn't overcome the Banality of the masses in the area so using Glamour is out of the question.  The Changeling could try to talk them out of capturing him, but it would probably make more sense to try to wriggle away, knock them unconscious with the limo door, or something.<br/>\n-Refreshment examples:  going on a walk, dancing<br/>\n<br/>\nMind:  several members of the Seelie Court try to negotiate the release of their friends from some Unseelie Redcaps who captured them and plan to eat them.<br/>\n-Refreshment examples:  attending a festival, reading old books about Arcadia<br/>\n<br/>\nGlamour:  anything involving magic or the fairy seeming.  I would expect that two Changelings fighting with their fairy bodies would resolve that with a Glamour-derived Ability.<br/>\n-Refreshment example:  chilling out at a Balefire, inspiring mortals<br/>\n<br/>\nThis breakdown has some interesting implications (I think so anyway).  The Mind is clearly shared between the mortal and chimerical bodies, so many Mental Abilities can be used whenever (e.g., Charm / Speak / Enigmas / Computers / Whatever).  However let's say a character is a Troll.  That Troll could have a Strength (G) Ability and would naturally be able to resolve chimerical conflicts by picking things up and throwing them (or whatever).  The human form cannot really access this Ability though, because (let's say) it's 12-year-old kid.  The human form, in this case, can't really fight at all, and would have to rely on a Stealth (B) check to go and hide from his foes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I'm going to do the initial writeup like with Mind / Body / Glamour and see where it leads.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375174/#Comment_375174" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T12:52:43+00:00" title="April 30, 2012 12:52PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can see what Eero is getting at with TSOY having a different feel than a typical WW world.

That point about chimerical bodies is a good one, as I was about to remark that separating Glamour into a separate Pool would have implications just like that; I forgot that that's actually how Changeling is supposed to work, so it's not a problem if the game feels like it doesn't allow your character to "carry over" his physical competence between the worlds.<br><br>This reaction of mine is largely because one of the overriding mechanical themes of TSoY is inclusive synergy: in that crunch landscape it would be a matter of course that different forms of power interact fluidly and true strength comes from discovering a balance between the Pools. (See Three-Corner magic for an obvious example.) This is a different setting, though, and one that revels in the dichotomy between the faerie and mundane worlds. In TSoY it would be considered problematic or at least peculiar if a crunch set enabled massive over-specialization into one facet of life at the expense of others (like Ammeni Alchemy does, as it runs mostly off one Pool), but here this might be a matter of course.<br><br>A good question to ask, though, is whether you're comfortable with characters over-specializing the other way: I can totally see how it's a core appeal of Changeling that your character is a weakling who's "really" strong troll, but what about a different character who's mundanely powerful but has an impotent fairy form? Does he fit? If not, then you might consider modifying the character generation process somehow to ensure that the characters are consistently weaker in real terms than as faerie creatures.<br><br>Also, it would probably be a good idea to make some crunch hygiene decisions. For example, you might decide that all mundane tools are handled as Effects (reserving Equipment rules for magic items), and there are no Pool-adders for mundane skills available. These limitations would go a long way towards ensuring that even if nominal Ability scores are high, mundane means ultimately won't stand up to the wonders of magic. Limiting big handfuls of bonus dice to magical situations would help emphasize the scope in a practical way.<br><br>(What I mean above might be obvious, but in case it's not, I'll list samples of what your basic enhancement Secrets for the different Pools might look like.)<br><br><b>Secret of Training (Ability, specialization)</b><br>This would be used to represent a character who has some extraordinary edge on a mundane Ability. Men in black or such might have this, for example. The character gains 1 bonus die when using the Ability within the chosen specialization, or with a different Ability in lieu of using the Ability in a support check (essentially, an automatic bonus die instead of the risk and bother of the support check). Also, the character can push himself for an extra bonus die. Training works for Glamour Abilities as well, although it is rare in the faerie world. <i><b>Cost:</b></i> 2 Body to push<br><br><b>Secret of Enhancement (Ability)</b><br>The character's chimerical form has been enhanced somehow, making it look obviously potent and supernatural. The character has no Pool cap on the chosen Ability, which has to be associated with the Glamour Pool.<br><br><b>Secret of Inspiration</b><br>This would be used on mundane Abilities that benefit from a faerie blessing, like if the character channeled their faery nature to do well in the real world. The dice cap on the character's mundane Ability is lifted for the rest of the scene (allowing the character to expend more than one point for bonus dice, to be clear), and he may use Glamour to buy bonus dice for the Ability as well as its original Pool. The character can bestow Inspiration on others, but only he may expend Glamour on it. <i><b>Cost:</b></i> 1 Glamour per character inspired per scene, plus any spent on bonus dice.<br><br><b>Secret of Chimerical Intellect</b><br>True fairies all have this Secret for free. All of the character's Mind-associated Abilities are associated with Glamour as well. However, they may only buy off Keys at a cost. <i><b>Cost:</b></i> 3 Mind to buy off a Key<br><br>Something like that. I'm intentionally going for asymmetric bonus dice profiles between the Pools: Body Abilities are expensive to boost, Mind Abilities have no basic boosting Secret at all, while Glamour Abilities get the ordinary TSoY Secret of Enhancement. Obviously there could be other, more specific Secrets that do things to unbalance the scheme, but these would be the first and most obvious thing for improving yourself in each of the areas.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20H" title="John H"><img alt="John H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20H">John H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375189/#Comment_375189" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T13:19:19+00:00" title="April 30, 2012  1:19PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Opposite the refresh rule change, I gave each vampire a free "Key of the Blood", which encouraged other vampiric / bestial actions.

Too much Mortal will cause you to be Undone and lose your fae mein while too much Fae will cause you to go into Bedlam (a state of Glamour-addicted madness) where you're unable to function in the "real" world.  When either happens, you pretty much lose control of your character.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is all CtD stuff here.  Basically, Bedlam has 3 stages.  In the first, the character suffers minor annoyances (colors changing, hearing voices, etc.).  In the second, the character suffers maladies that are more debilitating (believing that everything is from an ancient time / fantasy, delusions of grandeur, etc.).  In the third, the character is basically lost to madness.<br/>\n<br/>\nCuring Bedlam becomes more difficult with each stage and there are warning signs (e.g., no mortal friends, more than one fae treasure, in a state of unrequited love, etc.) that the Storyteller can use to determine if a character is going down the path of Bedlam.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecoming Undone is much more straighforward...  Basically, if your fae mein is exposed to too much Banality or gets destroyed by Chimerical damage, it is destroyed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm thinking of making Bedlam a set of Keys the Story Guide can give to people:<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Key of the First Threshold</b><br/>\nYour character suffers from minor hallucinations caused by your constant preference of the chimerical over the mundane.<br/>\n1xp:  React to stimuli that do not exist<br/>\n3xp:  Make a choice based on your hallucinations<br/>\nBuyoff:  Undergo Banality therapy<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Key of the Second Treshold</b><br/>\nYour character suffers from severe and debilitating hallucinations.

In CtD, you can cure yourself of Bedlam but fall victim to it again later.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe alternative I can see is to change the buyoff for 1st and 2nd thresholds something like "descend deeper into Bedlam" wherein they would basically acquire the next Threshold key.

In CtD, you can cure yourself of Bedlam but fall victim to it again later.</blockquote>\nThe way to handle this is to not equate the Key and the condition: the Story Guide can declare that a character falls into the first stage of Bedlam (and the player can try to resist it normally with appropriate Abilities, surely), but the condition itself does not have to be the same thing as the Key. The character can be in Bedlam (perhaps represented by nothing more than some Harm and our agreement that he's in Bedlam), and this provides the player with the opportunity to grab the Key, or the SG might even impose it after a failed resistance check. Whether he does or doesn't get the Key, the Bedlam passes through the fiction (a successful healing check, fictional positioning or whatever); the player may sell the Key or not; if he doesn't, then he can't benefit from it before he falls into Bedlam again - although I would consider it instant Bedlam if the player suggested some xp for himself from such a Key later on. If the player sells the Key, then he can still normally fall into Bedlam, but he just can't get experience points out of it.<br><br>The reason for why it works like that is that Keys do not "really" represent anything in the fiction, they just represent our structural thematic understanding of the fiction as audience. The rule about Keys not being repeatable is a hygiene rule that prevents us as audience and creators from going for the cheap serial storyline trick where the same thing that happened to Superman six months back happens to him <i>again</i> with slight variation, and we're supposed to care about it like it were somehow exceptional. We are not materially prevented from repeating themes, but we won't get new experience points from it, either. This causes Key buyoff to be an actually significant choice instead of a no-brainer.<br><br>The only way the rules enable for repurchasing a Key is to Transcend (or die, presumably), and then rebuild the character; the "reborn" character is essentially a new one for our purposes, so he can re-experience the travails the old one did. It is also possible to change the rules to enable repeated Keys, perhaps because one wants more of a serial fiction feel; I haven't explored these opportunities myself, largely because I'm happy with the enforced stakes of the game - people complain a lot about how the Solar system forces you to remove your character from the game "just as it was getting good", but most of the time I don't really feel it as a fellow traveller: as far as I'm concerned, the forced pacing of the game is a virtue that protects us from being weak and buckling to the models of commercial culture industry that teaches us to enjoy stories without end.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John H</cite>The alternative I can see is to change the buyoff for 1st and 2nd thresholds something like "descend deeper into Bedlam" wherein they would basically acquire the next Threshold key.  The player couldn't be "cured" exactly, but they could just choose not to give into Bedlam craziness.</blockquote>\nYes, this is the orthodox method: you can get "cured" from Bedlam as a matter of fictional positioning (not a trivial matter per se, but not an issue of resource mechanics either) to stop describing the Bedlamic details for your character, but the Key itself is there until and unless you buy it off, attracting you to fall back into Bedlam. Very much like addiction. I like the idea that the only buyoff is to descent deeper, as this represents the ever-present danger in a true-to-life manner. Also more elegant to not have multiple Bedlam Keys on a single character. The last Buyoff would probably be "defeat your chimerical nature to become truly human", were it my game; I wouldn't be afraid of having a character in the last act of his personal story (if you're not in your last act after three Key buyoffs, then you're the slowliest tortoise) lose his chimerical nature and be forced to adapt into living a human life, instead. (And players who don't like that can just Transcend and get their exception.)<br><br>To clarify, it seems to me that you probably should think of the primary mechanical impact of Bedlam as a circumstance penalty to activities; we've established in the fiction that the character is in Bedlam, and consequently it's harder for him to do many things that are impacted by his madness. The Key thing comes on top of this. Also, some characters might have Secrets that trigger off their own Bedlam or that of others, and so on. It's actually completely equal to having a broken leg and maybe having a Key of the Cripple or not. The "broken leg" is not a mechanical condition, but it's still real as an established fact, and the Story Guide has his means in the circumstance penalties for making it count at his discretion. Or if somebody caused it and it thus should carry more weight, make it an Effect or something.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375455/#Comment_375455" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T09:13:28+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  9:13AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, regarding Bedlam as a circumstance penalty, you might well decide that in Ability checks where the Bedlam matters (social, intellectual, whatever) the 1st degree condition warrants 1 penalty die, 2nd degree two penalty dice and 3rd degree would be <i>inferior leverage</i> as per World of Near; such a deeply delusional character would simply not be able to compete in certain things with healthy people.

Also do the same with the Keys: a player doesn't <i>have to</i> take that Key of the Second Threshold when descending, for example, but rather they merely can if they want to. It's good to have Bedlam be something that can happen and be recovered without any essential mechanical interactions to it. The Bedlam is just an opportunity for the SG to offer they Key ("Hey, would you like the Key to go with it now that you're crazy?"), not an mandate to push the character to this mechanical path. Just like a Key of Love or similar; characters can fall into love without the Key, it's just that the player can choose to make it a bigger deal by taking the Key.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20H" title="John H"><img alt="John H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20H">John H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376840/#Comment_376840" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-06T18:01:10+00:00" title="May  6, 2012  6:01PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 6, 2012 6:01PM by John H.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, so I have Pool and Ability descriptions up now.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://toasty-fish.com/tsoa/" rel="nofollow">http://toasty-fish.com/tsoa/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20H" title="John H"><img alt="John H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20H">John H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376845/#Comment_376845" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-06T18:25:10+00:00" title="May  6, 2012  6:25PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and pardon the visuals on there...

I myself would maybe lean towards e.g. what I suggested because I suspect that this power might not be appreciated by a player; the maintenance costs on Effects are a relatively minor concern usually, as they're something that'll come up in the future and not now.<br><br>On the other hand, it's a valid power and a powerful one, so if you sell it so the player appreciates it, then it's OK. To make best use of it, the player should be constantly on the lookout for high rolls related to interesting situations so as to accumulate a large library of antecedents for later. It'll cost at first, but later on he'll have a constant supply of bonuses to draw on. You should probably decree that only one Effect from this Secret can be drawn on per check, otherwise it's <i>too</i> powerful over a few sessions of play.<br><br>Actually, you could add one thing to make this seem cooler for the player: let them turn other people's rolls into Effects under this clause. Still only one Effect per check (bid for it with Pool if several characters want it, with ties going to whoever made the check), but there should be plenty of situations where his enemies or friends make good rolls and don't want to Effectivize it themselves. Or drop even that limitation and allow him to piggy-back on the best checks of others freely.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377841">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20H" title="John H"><img alt="John H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20H">John H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377841/#Comment_377841" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-11T13:12:32+00:00" title="May 11, 2012  1:12PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Actually, you could add one thing to make this seem cooler for the player: let them turn other people's rolls into Effects under this clause.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nThat's perfect, actually.
