It goes basically like this:  Incidental plot elements like a chase scene, or a rivalry, or a quest, are added during play by the players playing cards in a way that will let them reward the GM for developing those story elements.  That's all well and good, but when you remove the need to start out the game with a map of those incidentals, what's <i>left</i>?<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayers can also build up little plot elements about themselves ... setting up (for instance) a hang-up about self-doubt that other folks can recognize and work to, <b>BUT</b> they build that on top of a foundation of who their character is, and how they feel:  That basic, unchanging foundation provides a pole-star for them to orient around, which makes it much easier for them to bring out the other plot elements in a coherent framework.  Right now, the GM is totally lacking that, and to be honest I don't even know quite where to start on providing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those who want (hugely) more information, the whole solo playtest is available <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=26478.0" rel="nofollow">here</a>, but I don't think it's required reading.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156862/#Comment_156862" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-16T08:30:16+00:00" title="July 16, 2008  8:30AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why do you have a GM in the first place?

And the GM is responsible for bringing in A-level plot elements. So what framework could they use?<br/>\n<br/>\nI suggested episode themes.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, a theme is a statement (aspect, moral, message, lesson) or question about life, society, or human nature.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've GMed games where the theme was, "you don't have to grow up to be like your parents."<br/>\n<br/>\nSo all my A-level conflicts revolved around this idea. Put the characters into conflicts that there parents were in and have them make a choice informed by their parent's decisions, lives, and consequences. Have villains that pop up who are the way they are because of their parents. I'll even have the pacing reflect this with scenes with adult themes being purposely slower and more methodical. In general, I like to have two themes so that it doesn't become obvious. And I try not to make the theme absolute. Maybe players want to be like their parents.

Those are already a lot less specific than I'd like (Evil Overlord lessons:  The finale master plan shall not be much more complicated than "Press the red button!"), but it's aiming in the right direction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156925/#Comment_156925" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-16T10:39:38+00:00" title="July 16, 2008 10:39AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tony, how much did the game change since I've last played with you?<br><br>When we've played it we had two character players, one player who played the world, and one player who played the rest of the characters in the world.<br>Or so I remember?                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_156934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156934/#Comment_156934" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-16T10:52:59+00:00" title="July 16, 2008 10:52AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Guy:  It's evolved a long way since then.

But yeah, I think you can set the tone of the game and have some real fun by reigning in any catch-all phrases like "Trapped" (aren't we all?) and replacing them with School Lockdown. All of a sudden, there are specific questions that have to be answered (why is the school locked down, what is the principal doing about it, are we safe, when will the Lockdown be lifted, etc.).<br>\n  Does that help any?<br>\nDave M                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_156936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156936/#Comment_156936" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-16T10:58:54+00:00" title="July 16, 2008 10:58AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave:  May do.

It has three general behaviors (for Vain, for instance:  Lying about yourself, Admiring yourself, Pushing someone else out of the spotlight).  Any other player, when they notice the character doing one of these things, may award them a card.  One card per scene only (it is placed face down on the Personality card, and picked up at the end of the scene).<br/>\n<br/>\nROLE CARD:  Again, a card chosen from a separate deck, one per character.  It has three general <i>beliefs</i> (for Bookworm:  Knowing more means understanding better, Everything should be planned out, Structure is always good).  When a player has their character act motivated by one of those beliefs, they may themselves place a card on top of the Role card.  As with Personality, one card per scene.<br/>\n<br/>\nHANGUP:  A card that gets drawn from the deck, and then played by a non-GM player as an investment (rather than for its substantial conflict-resolving power):  It describes a hangup that prevents the character from taking action (for instance, Self-Restraint).  When another player notices the character <i>not acting</i> because of that hangup, they can give them a card.  One per scene.<br/>\n<br/>\nPLOT ELEMENT, GM:  A card that gets drawn from the deck, and then played as a bribe to the GM (rather than for its small conflict-resolving power):  It describes a type of behavior the character can engage in (for "Chase", for instance:  Run away).  Any time that the player has their character do that, they can give the GM a card.  One per scene.<br/>\n<br/>\nPLOT ELEMENT, PC:  A card that gets drawn from the deck, and then played as a bribe to other players (rather than for its medium conflict-resolving power):  It describes a type of behavior those characters can engage in (for "Prejudice," for instance:  Challenge your assumptions about them).  Any time that another player has their character do that, the player who placed the card can give that other player a card.  One per scene.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, put another way:  The GM can get cards through whatever their baseline equivalent of Personality and Role is, <i>or</i> through GM-specific plot elements on other players' characters.  PCs can get cards (a) directly through playing to their role, (b) through someone noticing that they played to their personality, (c) through someone noticing that they were restrained by their hangup, (d) through another player noticing that the first has played to <i>their</i> PC plot element.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMaking any sense, or is it too intricate to see without cards on the table?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156997/#Comment_156997" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-16T14:04:09+00:00" title="July 16, 2008  2:04PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Makes sense.
