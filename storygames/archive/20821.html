The game will be about building reputation, taking turf, and fighting rival gang members. What systems would you recommend?<br/><br/>As for preferences, I'm looking for something that is medium-light crunch, has some robust rules for hand to hand brawling/melee (as guns will probably not be used at all), and of course - a system that would aid in managing a gang and their domains?<br/><br/>I'd also like a system that wouldn't require a ton of hacking.

Oh my.<br/><br/>I'll throw in a total curveball here - <a href="http://www.burgergames.com/G1.PDF" rel="nofollow">Mobsters</a> is a rpg about the American mafia a hundred years ago. Its main claim to originality is that it's a very strategically focused game where the players manage reputation, turf, income and rival gangs in their quest to become the king of the hill; dramatic concerns are in the background, or emergent at most, compared to the vaguely wargamey concerns. It's nothing close to a clean design, but it has its charms, with some vague resemblance to <i>Poison'd</i>, and it wouldn't ultimately take much to adapt it to deal with Japanese gangbangers. Being free, perhaps it's worth checking out.<br/><br/>Following that train of thought, Poison'd would actually make for a really good gangbanger game, too. It's got all the tools for that. It's firmly in the "ton of hacking" category, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/icemaster109" title="icemaster109"><img alt="icemaster109" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/icemaster109">icemaster109</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457150/#Comment_457150" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-17T05:09:44+00:00" title="October 17, 2016  5:09AM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The obvious choice is AW or one of its descendants, since they often cover "medium-light crunch", combat, and "managing a gang and their domains" quite explicitly.<br/><br/>Do you have any more specific interests, in terms of the gameplay or the kind of stories which might produced?</blockquote>\nI mean, the bulk of the game will be about taking a small gang, and slowly building it up. It will be heavily inspired by delinquent anime and manga such as Sun-Ken Rock and Crows. I'm guessing a big chunk of the game will be scheming up ways to make money, interaction with other gangs and authorities, and some pretty brutal hand to hand combat.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457151">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457151/#Comment_457151" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-17T05:31:38+00:00" title="October 17, 2016  5:31AM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a cool subject matter, I could see myself gaming that. Can't really think of any off-the-shelf games that would make me happy, though. Considering where I'm at creatively myself at this time, I'd consider Apocalypse World too light and too drama-oriented - like the Forgite drama games of its tradition, it doesn't really go very deep into the everyday particulars of its subject matter, so to speak. The same goes for my own go-to generic drama/action game, <i>Solar System</i>; just like AW it'd do this, but would require some design work, and I would personally prefer a more crunchy and detailed system to really bite into the domain management aspects of the subject matter...<br/><br/>For some reason <i>Burning Wheel</i> comes to me as a potentially interesting chassis that would make for well-rounded manga drama while also supporting all sorts of topical detail, plus an intensive combat system. It's on the heavy side, though, and would take a massive amount of hackwork (as in, you'd write a lightweight game from scratch for the same effort), so not at all what you're looking for - but for me it seems like something I might choose.<br/><br/>Ah, how about an appropriate FATE variant? I'm thinking <i>Houses of the Blooded</i> to be specific, but for all I know something even more appropriate might exist out there. In general FATE fits the bill here pretty well, being medium-crunch and having rules subsystems that at least approximate your topics (gang management, melee combat). It could fail for being too much work to hack together, I couldn't say off-hand whether there's anything more applicable than HotB domain management crunch out there somewhere.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457152/#Comment_457152" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-17T05:59:22+00:00" title="October 17, 2016  5:59AM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would say the new <i>Blades in the Dark</i> is perfect for this.

Another option, is doing a little re-skinning of Blades in the Dark.
