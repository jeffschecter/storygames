                    Well, gang, it's actually coming along. What's actually coming along, you say?<br/><br/>My OGL "Cabbages and Kings" supplement, based on the 1904 novel by O. Henry, one of his few longer works. It will include an Encyclopedia Anchuria to detail that fictional nation, it will include new systems for graft and romance, it will have stat blocks, campaign concepts and adventure hooks, it will have story formats and character guidelines, it will have professional art and photographs obtained one hundred percent legally and one hundred percent for free.  The more I work on this project, the more excited I am about this combination: a public domain work and an open gaming system.<br/><br/>In this thread, we talk about marrying decent open systems to cool public domain works, the advantages, disadvantages, how it's been done good and bad, what we'd like to see and what probably won't work.<br/><br/>I'll start with a couple of examples:<br/><br/>On rpgnow.com, there's a supplement for <a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=3623&amp;" rel="nofollow">Glinda of Oz.</a> It broke my heart to see such a wonderful idea - Oz roleplaying - presented in such a horrible fashion. There was absolutely no attention to the actual story, and the fantasy adventure content was bog-standard D&amp;D monster and NPC blocks. Gang, in Oz, it's questionable whether death even exists as we know it! You can be cut into a thousand pieces and still be alive! And there's not one word, not one, about that. Not one word about creating Oz-like characters, which is a huge part of the wonder of the setting.<br/><br/>Now, there's a lot that can be done with Oz to make it easier for players to get their heads around and more suitable for your typical OGL system - I myself have done some work on a "Crouching Cowardly Lion, Hidden Scarecrow" game that melds aspects of Oz with aspects of wuxia and martial arts movies.  There's Grimm, which deals with fairy tales in general but whose "kid" classes are excellent starting points.  But this didn't quite make it. (I probably shouldn't have given it three stars, but there it is.)<br/><br/>If you click around at rpgnow.com you will also find "Shakespeare d20" supplements, from several publishers, actually.  However, none of them appear to have gotten much past the 'stat out the characters' stage to any great degree.<br/><br/>I imagine a lot of licensed publishers have this trouble. What do you do past the licensed material?  Star Wars d6 had some great advice as far as pacing went (really quite ahead of its time) but for nigh on thirty years now there hasn't been even the slightest attention in any of the dozens and dozens of Star Wars supplements as to the sort of story Star Wars is, and how one might make a story in Star Wars' "shape".  The combination of humor, drama, and when to introduce twists, turns, new characters, and old tragedies is really what we need to get out of a licensed setting book.  (Hell, George Lucas could have used that advice...ahem.)<br/><br/>Gareth-Michael Skarka is releasing a classic black and white movie action serial, "Radar Men From The Moon"...in serial format!...with supplements for each segment and descriptions of each situation, as part of his pulp d20 imprint at Adamant. For someone who once fulminated about d20, he's embraced it and is doing some pretty great things with it. This is an awesome idea, it sold me an electronic subscription to the line.<br/><br/>And, just in case you haven't read Cabbages and Kings yet, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext01/ckngs10.txt" rel="nofollow">you are in for one of the most delicious treats in all of turn-of-the-century popular literature.</a> </div>

                            Part of the problem is a lack of open gaming systems.  Absolutely no one (other than Clinton) has embraced open gaming systems other than d20.  Or rather, no one with a well-developed or popular system has done it; other than TSoY, the systems that are open are also lackluster and bland.  I'm not sure what the dynamic there is - maybe a lack of desire to 'give away the really good ideas'.                        </div>

Yes and no.<br/><br/>'Generic' is one thing.  'Bland' is another.  Active Exploits is the latter, unfortunately.                        </div>

                            I always get Active Exploits and the Action! system mixed up. Ah well. <br/><br/>Now look, this thread is not just about listing all the open or near-open systems we can find. Let's talk about public domain source material, how to find it, choose it, adapt it, and use it with open or near-open systems. Wushu is a great addition to the list and I have not looked at TSOY very closely so any suggestions for those systems are greatly appreciated.<br/><br/>Of course one of the great classics is War of the Worlds. To a certain degree, its plot, when translated, is one of the great railroads - the Martians are damn near unbeatable, they invade, they conquer, they are killed by bacteria.  Yet that's the whole point of the plot, as a critique of colonialism. That's why I was so glad that <a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=1672&amp;" rel="nofollow">the Action!/d20 adaptation</a> "got it".  When they suggested ways to alter the source material, it was always with the colonialist story arc in mind.  Asymmetric warfare, collaboration, and even passive resistance (with slightly less implacable Martians) are all listed, and although there's a section on big battles with the Martians (after all, there are some in the source material), it makes it fairly clear that the story itself is not really about such battles. I only wish they would have gone farther with it....<br/><br/>Of course Cthulhu by Gaslight has stolen from Sherlock Holmes stories for years. Holmes pastiche is one of my great weaknesses so it always brings me a smile when a group is hired by Mycroft or encounters Lestrade. (Lestrade gets an unfair bad rap in pastiches usually - he was quite a good policeman, but the kind of bizarre cases in the Holmes casebook were beyond normal police work.)  Anyway, adapting Holmes stories to RPGs runs into the Doc Savage problem (as Adventure! so succinctly put it) of having an extremely strong and vivid protagonist already at the center of the source material.  I can think of one way of solving this right off the bat - Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty both went over Reichenbach Falls in 1888 and were "killed" for over a year. What happened to Moriarty's crime ring then? Perhaps they were opposed by the eccentric, brilliant members of a newly formed forensic science squad at Scotland Yard. This would be CSI: London 1889.  You could even extend Holmes' absence for several more years without injuring the timeline at all. (Actually he would have preferred it that way...)  You could use the OGL for this without much difficulty. Although I do somewhat like the Spycraft (non-open) investigation system, in which investigation points are "earned" by various tactics and then "spent" to learn things like the names of suspects, their location, and so on, you might also get some mileage out of a "mystery point" system in which "hits" are scored against the mystery until none are left. This would actually reflect the Holmes books quite a lot - the mystery leaves us in the dark until the very end, when Holmes says "aha" and reveals all to the reader. There is no progressive enlightenment as the story goes on, either the mystery is solved or it isn't.                        </div>

<p>Finding public domain source material is <em>easy</em>: Project Gutenberg. Or, Archive.org for film, although you have to be careful there, since the films are often in the public domain but the story they've adapted might not be. "Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon" (with Basil Rathbone) should be safe, but the Max Fleischer Superman cartoons aren't, for example.</p>
<p>I don't see that we can say a lot about how to adapt PD source material to open game systems, because it's going to depend on the individual text. Each one is different and has different needs.</p>

                            As for finding stuffs, a great place to start is Wikisource: <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Main_Page</a><br/><br/>Though, as with Archive.org you have to watch the liscences -- some of the stories are free content distribution, but not public domain in all their intellectual content. (As I understand it, please tell me I'm stupid if I'm wrong.) But if you just read the helpful clicky links at the bottom of the pages, you should be able to figure that stuff out NP. <br/><br/>As for doing it into games, that gets into the tricky world of game design. There are the basic lessons: be aware of what your source material does and how it does it, be aware of what you want your game to do in relation to that, and be aware of how your system is going to support that in actual play. Once past those things get complicated quickly. <br/><br/>So, perhaps we can start with a simple game? I'm going to go to Wikisource and hit "random" until I get a book in English and in the Public domain that also is famous enough that some of us should have read it. I'll post its name and a link, and then you tell me what the things you would want out of a game version would be. Then we can figure out which open systems come closest to getting us those things. <br/><br/>Will this work? Who the fuck knows. <br/><br/>Ready: <br/><br/>Alice in Wonderland. <br/><br/><br/>P.S. The link to TSOY is here: <a href="http://www.anvilwerks.com/?The-Shadow-of-Yesterday" rel="nofollow">TSOY</a> just because from whatever bizzar syncronicity freaking Joshua had to go and say "Shadow of Wonderland" before I got Alice in Wonderland.                        </div>

<br/>
Answer: pretty much never.  The Copyright Term Extension Act--also known as "The Mickey Mouse Protection Act"--retroactively extended the term of copywritten materials by about 20 years.  Steamboat Willie is scheduled to go public in 2019 (though Mickey Mouse is also trademarked).  Even if you can wait another 13 years, though, you'll probably have to wait longer because they'll certainly try to extend it again in 2018.  <br/>
<br/>
Public domain is pretty much frozen in the U.S. right now.  Which is a shame.  I kind of think Superman belongs to everyone.                        </div>

                            The Library of Congress is a great place to get photographs and the like for anything in the 19th Century.  And it's all pretty much public domain at this point.<br/><br/>The central problem, as I see it, is that you're constantly adapting, well, literature from the 19th Century.  There's a lot of good stuff there, but then again a lot of it has already been adapted to death.<br/><br/>Exactly how many <i>Fin de Ciele</i> RPGs can the market bear?                        </div>

And actually, if you think about it, novels in general are highly underrepresented as part of licensed RPGs, at least when compared to movies or TV shows. And in the 19th and early 20th centuries, when  novels were often serialized, they lend themselves to the kind of extensions that TV shows and sequential movies do today, that feed into RPG stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, how many RPG adaptations of novels are out there where the novel is the core element of the adaptation? GURPS Scarlet Pimpernel, yes. What else?                        </div>

                            One of the great things about using a system like D20, FATE, Fudge, etc. is that much of the work is done for you.  The resulting game may not be the BEST possible game, but you get a finished result with less work.  Given the small market for such games, that kind of development makes sense.                        </div>

EDIT: looks like no, it's just "scientific romance", although that genre is stretched quite a bit to include some things you wouldn't think of.<br/>
